                    <p><strong><u>SALE OF SOUL AGREEMENT</u></strong></p><p>This Sale of Soul Agreement (hereafter “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) is effective as of the date upon which the party selling their soul (hereafter “<strong>Seller</strong>”) signs the contract and returns it to the party receiving the soul (hereafter “<strong>Buyer</strong>”) in either electronic or physical format. This agreement is entered into freely by both parties set forth in the signature block below (“Buyer” and “Seller”) and both parties agree to honor and be bound by the terms of this agreement in any court, real, imagined, or otherwise, or as set before any judge or any being serving in a similarly recognizable capacity making judgment as to the validity of this contract, in any state of reality or nonreality, physical or metaphysical, for all eternity (past, present, and future) and also any states of being or nonbeing outside of our human conception of time.</p><p><strong>BUYER AND SELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p><p><strong>SECTION I. DEFINITION OF “SOUL”</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;The “Soul” of the Seller for the purposes of this contract is understood to mean the spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence of their self which exists independently and distinctly from their material being.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; While both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the true nature, scope, and existence of any Such soul, whether or not it exists, is unknown and unknowable to either of them, the ambiguity involved in no way limits or renders any portion of this agreement invalid and the total scope of the Soul shall be considered as subject to the agreement.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Seller’s religion or belief system lacking a concept of a “Soul” or metaphysical reality lacking the concept of a “Soul” as given shall not alter the stated intent of this contract, and the essence being transferred to the Buyer shall constitute whatever immaterial equivalent, if any, exists that is closest in nature to the given definition of the Seller’s spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that a “Soul” is not actually immortal, this contract shall remain in effect through whatever duration of time or non-time that the soul exists in any manner, state, or way of being.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event that the Seller’s “Soul” does not exist as an independent entity outside of the whole “one-ness” of reality as commonly described in some belief systems, and in the event that this belief about the nature of reality reflects actual reality, this contract will remain in effect for whatever period of time or non-time and to whatever degree that the Seller’s immaterial essence is distinguishable in any form, manner, or state of being from the sum whole of immaterial or material existence.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buyer acknowledges and fully understands that the Seller may deny the existence of any such Soul as defined here in Section I or deny the possibility of transferring ownership of said Soul to another party according to their personal belief system. Buyer agrees to accept the risk of being unable to actually take possession of said Soul from the selling party due to either its nonexistence or non-transferability on the part of the Soul’s owner.</p><p><strong>SECTION II. SALE AND TRANSFER OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller intend this Agreement to be a contract of sale for the Seller’s Soul, as defined in Section I, wherein the Buyer shall provide the compensation outlined in Section III in exchange for ownership and use of the Seller’s Soul as described in Sections I and IV.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The transfer of ownership of this Soul shall occur at the moment this document is signed and returned to the Buyer by the Seller in any format, electronic or physical.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;If for any reason this Soul or a portion of this Soul shall be found to be non-transferable from Seller to Buyer, this shall in no way limit the other provisions of this agreement or the Buyer’s rights with respect to use and possession of the Soul. Seller agrees to transfer ownership of Soul to Buyer to whatever degree is possible, in part or in whole, and commits to the terms of usage, transfer, or possession of Soul as described in Section IV to whatever degree may be possible.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;As compensation for this transfer of ownership of the Soul, Buyer agrees to compensate Seller an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars, to be transferred according to the terms given in Section III, within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer provides the Buyer with full usage rights and ownership of the soul to do with as they see fit, including but not limited to the provisions given in Section IV of this document.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer prevents the Seller from any personal or public use of or claim of ownership to the transferred Soul without the express permission, in writing, of the Buyer. Other than limiting their making claims of ownership to the Soul, this clause shall in no way limit the material actions of the Seller.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;This transfer is permanent and irrevocable except as given in the terms of this contract. Buyer shall be the new owner of Seller’s Soul for all time and non-time and states of being, with all according rights and privileges of use as given in Section IV.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that actual possession, use, or storage of the Soul by the Buyer is not required for Buyer’s ownership, transfer, or future use of the Soul to be enforceable under these terms. Buyer may, at their discretion, leave the Soul in the location it currently exists or move it from its current location at any time and at their own discretion. Buyer may use or not use the soul as Buyer sees fit. Failure to take possession of or to use the Soul shall in no way invalidate the ownership, usage rights, subsequent transfer, or any other term of this contract with respect to the transferred Soul.</p><p><strong>SECTION III. COMPENSATION FOR TRANSFER</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer agrees to compensate Seller with an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars for the transfer of the Soul within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic, as described in Section II-C, according to the conditions outlined in this Section (III).</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sending of these funds (hereafter “the payment”) shall occur via PayPal.com and shall be sent to an electronic mail address provided by the Seller.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that no address is provided by the Seller to render the payment, Buyer will send payment to the address used to transfer electronically signed contract documents or make a reasonable attempt to acquire such an address from the Seller via the same communication medium over which the signed documents are transferred. Failure to acquire a valid payment address from Seller within the 48-hour period shall not invalidate the contract or the Buyer’s ownership and usage of transferred Soul provided this is the primary reason for the Buyer’s inability to render compensation.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller acknowledges that small variations in actual value of currency may occur from moment to moment and that in sending a nominal amount of $10 USD via the PayPal payments system within 48 hours of receipt of the contract as described in Section III-A, they have satisfied their obligation to compensate the Seller under the terms of this agreement.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to pay any and all standard PayPal fee percentages that may arise in the course of transferring sent funds to their personal accounts.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees that their failure to accept the funds shall in no way invalidate the agreement and that the contract will remain completely whole and enforceable regardless of their acceptance or non-acceptance of the payment.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that the Buyer fails to send the compensation as described in this Section (III) within 48 hours of receipt of the contract signed by the Seller, the contract will be considered null and void and the ownership of the Soul shall revert to the Seller.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;No action or use of the Soul may be undertaken by the Buyer within the 48-hour period beginning with the receipt of the contract signed by the Seller until and unless the Buyer has adequately rendered payment to Seller as described in this Section (III).</p><p><strong>SECTION IV. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that the owner of the Soul may possess, claim, keep, store, offer, transfer, or make use of it in whole or in part in any manner that they see fit to do so, conventional or otherwise, including (but not limited to) the purposes described in this Section (IV). Example uses of the Soul which would be permitted under these terms include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Publicly claiming to be the owner of the Soul in question.</li><li>Transferring of said Soul, in whole or part, to any person or entity, for any reason.</li><li>Sacrificing or offering said Soul, in whole or in part, to any deity or spiritual entity.</li><li>Spending or using the soul, in whole or in part, for some purpose which causes it to diminish in value, quantity, or substance or be subsumed into a larger whole.</li><li>Transferring the burden, credit, or responsibility of any actions reflected in the State of a Soul from another Soul to this Soul or from this Soul to another Soul.</li><li>Long term storage, usage, or preservation of the Soul in a state which would prevent it from taking the course of development, evolution, or relocation it may otherwise take naturally or due to the actions or material status of the Seller.</li></ul><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to fully relinquish any right of ownership or usage they have in the Soul and agrees that they will not attempt to use, keep, transfer, or sell the same Soul again even if it remains in their possession or immediate vicinity.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller agrees not to interfere or attempt to interfere via metaphysical, magickal, or spiritual means with Buyer’s attempt to claim, transfer, or …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The animation first appeared in Developer Preview 4 and many thought it was a placeholder for something more polished. However, after awhile, many people seem to take a liking to it. Here’s a series of frames that shows it if you’re not familiar.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="128" height="640" src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png 128w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-60x300.png 60w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-54x270.png 54w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px"><figcaption>POOF!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The legendary poof animation came out of a discussion of the Human Interface team that wanted this action to have an animation to go with the very liquid Aqua interface.</p>



<p>One of the most talented engineers on the team took out a piece of paper. I wish I could say it was a napkin to make the story better.</p>



<p>On the piece of paper, he drew a series of frames similar to what is pictured above. A quick, five frame animation. The intention of the designer was that these drawings would stoke further discussion. That it would get cleaned up and refined later.</p>



<p>But that never happened. It shipped as is. And the rest is history.</p>

<p>It’s interesting how learning is sometimes like travel. At the end of the journey, you end up back where you started, only with a broadened perspective.</p>
<p>Trivial example: code comments. When I was new to programming I commented my code extensively. If I’m honest, it was to compensate for my difficulties in reading code. A consequence of this is it allowed me to be lazy in the code I wrote. I wouldn’t need to put much effort into making it clear and readable because there were always plain English comments to fall back on.</p>
<p>Then I joined a team that was militantly against comments, where every comment was an admission of failure to write readable code. I took this on-board and disciplined myself not to rely on comments. This forced me to spend more time on refactoring my code to make it as readable and “self-documenting” as possible. I still wouldn’t say I’m there yet, but I’m confident that my code is much more readable now than it was then.</p>
<p>However, in the last year or so, I’ve started adding comments again. Not too many, but here and there to add more context. It felt like blasphemy at first. Some of my comments are even somewhat redundant, but I’ve since learned that <a href="https://www.cnothelfer.com/redundant-encoding">encoding the same information in redundant ways</a> is an important principle for aiding our comprehension. For example, traffic lights use both colour and position to encode the same information.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems as though I’ve returned to where I started: I’m commenting code again. However, if I hadn’t disciplined myself to do without comments entirely for a while, I wouldn’t have been forced to learn how to write more readable code. Abstaining from code comments is a <a href="https://coderefinery.nz/2020/10/21/forcing-functions-in-software-development/">forcing function</a> for learning to write more readable code. At some point, you can re-integrate commenting as a useful tool rather than a crutch.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m confident that if I could travel back in time and tell past-me or any of my old teammates that, actually, comments can be a valuable tool to aid comprehension, I’m positive I would encounter strong resistance. This is just as it should be; I don’t think it can be any different. When you’re learning a new skill, it’s necessary to become somewhat closed off and follow a direction single-mindedly for a while, it’s part of the learning process. If you were too suggestible and deviated too easily, you would go around in small circles and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern across the development community when a new technology or framework is introduced (I won’t name names. I’m sure you can think of some examples). In the early days, there is hype and zealotry. Then over time as more developers adopt the tech into production and real issues with it emerge, there is disillusionment and abandonment. Finally a more realistic, calibrated picture of the trade-offs of the technology emerge.</p>

<p>A stunning admission by the US government that it possesses UFO debris was recently made in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed over three years ago by this author. In a reply letter, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has ended decades of speculation by verifying that UFO material has indeed been recovered. Now officially referred to as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) rather than UFOs, some of this material was placed with a defense contractor for analysis and storage in "specialized facilities." Incredibly, part of the information released discusses material with shape recovery properties, much like the "memory metal" debris found fallen at the Roswell UFO crash in 1947.</p>



<p>And based on the documentation received, it appears that the retrieved debris exhibits other extraordinary capabilities. In addition to "remembering" their original form when bent or crushed, some of these futuristic materials have the potential to make things invisible, "compress" electromagnetic energy, and even slow down the speed of light. Although much of the reports' details are redacted, what can be gleaned is that these technologies represent a literal quantum leap beyond the properties of all existing material known to man.</p>



<p>Finally, the whereabouts of the UFO debris held by the contractor is unknown. Some months ago they laid off their employees and ceased operations. Former company officials, when reached, refuse comment.</p>



<h6>THE FOIA REQUEST</h6>



<p>The original 2017 FOIA request made to the DIA asks for the physical descriptions, properties and composition of UFO/UAP material held by the government and its contractor. The request is unambiguous in its meaning. It refers to UFO/UAP material and "physical debris recovered by personnel of the Department of Defense as residue, flotsam, shot-off material or crashed UAPs or unidentified flying objects." The FOIA request can be seen in full <a href="https://7f215854-ce29-4a12-9bb0-f4e7eb88d38a.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4aac_c53f66ccc2f745908c6b639c1042977e.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span>here:</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-kkurd3px" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>In their reply, the DIA amazingly agrees that it has documents responsive to my request on recovered UFO debris and its analysis, the program under which it was administered, AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), and that their defense contractor (Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada) has stored the material. They also provide some reports related to the possible applications of the studied material.</p>



<p>The delays and excuses offered up during the years awaiting the FOIA response were many. They include that the records search involved another agency that needed to be consulted; that I had been emailing my former FOIA Officer though she'd left months ago and never received my follow-up communication; to a re-assignment of my case to the DIA's FOIA Chief, Steve Tumiski. After a lawsuit was threatened with the retention of counsel, the DIA somehow, after so very long, acted to respond.</p>



<h6>THE RELATION TO ROSWELL</h6>

</div><p>The information received includes several pages of what are called "advanced technology reports" on Nitinol - a shape recovery alloy. Nitinol has similar properties to the "memory metal" found fallen as debris at the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash of 1947. The pages found within the FOIA reply on Nitinol explore its potential for integrating it into the human body for the improvement of health. Well over 40 witnesses to Roswell have mentioned a metal-like material that could "remember itself" when deformed or folded, returning to its original state seamlessly and instantly. In a series of investigative articles appearing in the UFO Explorations website article archive section, the case is credibly made that Nitinol represents our first</p><div id="comp-kkuwalzl" title=""><div data-testid="linkElement"><wix-image id="img_comp-kkuwalzl" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kkuwalzl&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" data-image-zoomed="" data-has-ssr-src="true"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_169,h_96,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/Roswell%20Disc%2C%20719x406%2C%20enhanced%20with%20Pho.png" alt="Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho"></wix-image></div></div><div id="comp-kkuwz42y" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>attempts to replicate a material of the craft's construction. The Roswell debris was flown to Wright Field in Ohio after the crash. Some months later, Wright granted a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute to begin phase diagrams (recipes) for mixing Nickel and ultra-high-purity Titanium, required to make memory metal. General Arthur Exon, Base Commander at Wright Patterson in the 1960s, who flew over the crash site in 1947, spoke to researcher Kevin Randle on tape. He stated that it was his understanding that some of the wreckage being tested was comprised in part of "specially processed" Titanium.</p>



<p>And in September of 1947, two months after the Roswell crash, General George Shulgen of Air Intelligence described "the materials of construction" of the flying saucers as potentially being made of <span>"composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metal and plastics."&nbsp;</span> Some of the Roswell crash debris was said to display metal-plastic like appearance and characteristics. The DIA-sponsored reports I received mention a highly-engineered material called "metamaterial" (see below) as comprised of <span>"composite media."</span> Metamaterial can be <span>layered with metal and plastics.</span></p>



<p>Throughout the received FOIA documents, mention is made of potential use of some of the materials in "advanced aerospace platforms." Reference is made to desired material characteristics such as being extremely lightweight and tough, like the characteristics of the debris found at the Roswell crash.</p>



<h6>OTHER MATERIAL</h6>



<p>Extensive reference is also made to the study and application of what the tests called <span>metamaterial</span>*, including that some of this material:</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Can be used to "slow down light" and even "bring light to a complete standstill"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to manipulate the speed of light (electromagnetic energy traveling at 186,000 miles per second)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>May induce invisibility by manipulating refraction, reflectivity and increasing light absorption. The reports use terms like "optical isolation" and "transparency" and make reference to a "MetaMirror" technology</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to make something unable to be seen, and/or picked up by radar, scanning or imaging)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Has the interesting ability to "compress electromagnetic energy"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Such condensing can make information and energy storage smaller and their transfer faster by reducing volume)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Exhibits a particular "tunable resonance" which was likely "determined during fabrication."</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(The phrase "tunable resonance" refers to a vibration of large amplitude from a small stimulus. Very recent research shows potential in the field of "energy harvesting" technologies, or pulling energy from the environment for low-power electronic devices)</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>There seem to be many exciting, but far in the future, technical applications to these materials that will change the way our lives are lived.</p>



<p><span>*Metamaterial</span>, a coined and relatively recent word, is believed to be any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. Some of these materials appear to be made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. These composite media can be engineered to exhibit unique electromagnetic properties. Made up from subwavelength building blocks (most often based on metals), these metamaterials allow for extreme control over light energy and optical fields, enabling such effects such as negative refraction to be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Portions of the reports center on next-generation <span>Amorphous Metals</span> (also called "liquid metal" or "metallic glass") which are novel engineering alloys with disordered atomic-scale structure. Metal is crystalline in its solid state, which means it has a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals though are crazily disordered - a metal-like material so unique that it is believed it may one day replace plastic and metal in many applications. The material is stronger and lighter than any existing metal, can be injection molded like plastic (no rivets, seams or joining, smooth like many reported UFOs) and will never corrode or rust. Imagine using a single razor blade for the rest of your life because it stays super sharp forever. A golf club so springy it can drive a ball farther than any pro ever has. An artificial hip implant that performs better than a real hip. A cell phone case that is completely indestructible.</p>



<p>The contract that Bigelow was granted was under the auspices of an official government UFO study (whose existence was revealed by <span>The New York Times</span> in 2017). The contract was for Bigelow to construct "specialized modified facilities" to hold the material for testing. The DoD/Pentagon UFO study effort was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). It ran for some years (and under more than one name), and according to informed sources, remains in operation to this day. What is inside these "specially modified facilities" that requires such contracted technical services? What is the nature of this anomalous debris and what are its properties that it requires shielding?</p>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>
<p><img src="https://synack.me/img/raspberrypi-swd.png" alt="Raspberry Pi SWD wiring"></p>
<div><div><pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.202 -L3333:localhost:3333
openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg

arm-eabi-gdb obj/main
target extended-remote localhost:3333
monitor arm semihosting enable
load
run
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_CSR</span> <span>:=</span>
    <span>(</span><span>CLKSOURCE</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>--  cpu clock</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>

         <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"isr_systick"</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

            <p> This screener assesses stocks by the following two factors:
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest short interest</li>
            <li>Mentions on Reddit</li>
        </ul><p>
        An indicator of whether they may be the next "meme stock". Short interest represents the total number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is a helpful indicator that gives people an idea of what the overall market feels about a particular stock by showing what short-sellers are doing.
Historically, hedge funds would often announce their short position on a stock.
Investors can take advantage of understanding short interest by being able to predict the next “short squeeze”; in other words, a situation in which the stock jumps sharply higher, forcing short sellers who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent even bigger losses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                                </div>
                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<p><span>When discussing symmetric encryption algorithms - like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - you may have been considering using AES-128 or AES-256. The last three digits represent the length of the secret key – think of it like the number of teeth in a physical key. From a security perspective, a 256-bit secret key is obviously better, but does it really matter which of the two options you choose? This article walks through some of the main security considerations for AES-128 and AES-256.</span></p>
<h2><span>Brute Force Attack Protection</span></h2>
<p><span>A brute force key guessing attack is where an attacker tries each potential secret key until the right one is found. This attack is guaranteed to succeed (eventually) and (ideally) should be the fastest way to break an encryption algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>When discussing brute force attack protection, understanding just what different key lengths mean is essential. With the impending arrival of quantum computing, it is also good to know how they will impact cryptographic security. Are the current forms of AES strong enough?</span></p>
<h2><span>The Difference in Key Length</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference between 128 and 256-bit encryption algorithms is the length of the secret key that they use. The 128 and 256 in AES-128 and AES-256 means that the two algorithms use 128-bit and 256-bit keys respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>The longer the secret key, the harder it is for an attacker to guess via brute force attack. However, AES-256 is not just twice as strong as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>With 128 and 256-bit secret keys, AES-128 and AES-256 have 2<sup>128</sup> and 2<sup>256</sup> potential secret keys respectively. With binary keys, each bit added to the key length doubles the key space. This means that AES-256 has 2^128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 times as many keys as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, a brute force attack against an AES-256 key is much harder than against an AES-128 key. However, even a 128-bit key is secure against attack by modern technology. At its peak, the Bitcoin network - arguably the largest modern use of computational power for cryptography - <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate?scale=1&amp;timespan=all">performed approximately</a></span> 150*10^18≈2^67 operations per second. Assuming that these operations are of equal difficulty to a brute force attack, it would take the Bitcoin network over 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to crack a single AES-128 key.</p>
<h2><span>Resistance to Quantum Computing</span></h2>
<p><span>The threat of quantum computing to cryptography has been well-publicized. Quantum computers work very differently than classical ones, and quantum algorithms can make attacks against cryptography much more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of asymmetric encryption algorithms (like RSA), quantum computing completely breaks them. However, for symmetric algorithms like AES, Grover’s algorithm - the best known algorithm for attacking these encryption algorithms - only weakens them. Grover’s algorithm decreases the effective key length of a symmetric encryption algorithm by half, so AES-128 has an effective key space of 2^64 and AES-256 has an effective key space of 2^128.</span></p>
<p><span>However, while this seems significant, it doesn’t break either algorithm. With the right quantum computer, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/6#98"><span>AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack</span></a>, while AES-256 would take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/15/age-universe-13-8-billion-years-scientists-confirm/3287409001/"><span>about 1.38x10^10 years old</span></a>, so cracking AES-128 with a quantum computer would take about 200 times longer than the universe has existed.</span></p>
<p><span>This also makes the assumption that an attacker has the “right” quantum computer. Cracking AES-128 would take an estimated 2,953 logical qubits and AES-256 would require 6,681. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023"><span>largest quantum computer had 65 qubits</span></a> with a goal of hitting 1,000 by 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span>128 and 256-Bit Algorithms Under the Hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Brute force attacks against a secret key are the best potential attack against a secure algorithm but what if the algorithm is has a vulnerability?</span></p>
<p><span>AES is broken up into two distinct algorithms: the encryption algorithm (which does the actual encryption) and the key schedule (which converts the secret key into round keys). The security of each of these matters to the security of AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Encryption Algorithm</span></h2>
<p><span>AES-128 and AES-256 use an almost identical encryption algorithm. Each encryption algorithm takes a set of operations and applies them a certain number of times or “rounds”. The only difference between AES encryption algorithms is the number of rounds: AES-128 uses 10 and AES-256 uses 14.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that, if an attack against the AES algorithm was discovered, it would likely affect both AES-128 and AES-256. The only difference is if the attack only worked up to a certain number of rounds of AES (which some AES attacks do). If an attack worked for at least ten rounds but less than fourteen, then a clear winner exists between AES-128 and AES-256. However, no such attack is currently known for AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Key Schedule</span></h2>
<p><span>The key schedule is where AES-128 and AES-256 become very different. The AES-128 key schedule is designed to turn a 128-bit secret key into ten 128-bit round keys. The AES-256 key schedule transforms a 256-bit secret key into fourteen 128-bit rounds keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Of the two, the AES-128 key schedule is actually more secure. The AES-256 key schedule has known weaknesses that might make it possible to perform related key attacks against the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>A related key attack should never happen in real life. For it to occur, an attacker needs to: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span> </span><span>Convince the key owner to take their existing encryption key</span></li>
<li><span> Create three other keys based on this key using relationships known to the attacker</span></li>
<li><span> Encrypt <span>2<sup>99.5</sup> </span>&nbsp;(that’s eight followed by 29 zeros) blocks of data with these keys</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Even if this attack were feasible, it can be avoided simply by using good key generation practices. A truly random key should never be vulnerable to a related key attack because it has no related keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the fact that this attack is infeasible to perform, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">some cryptographers advise</a> – when given a choice between AES-128 and AES-256 with no constraints – using AES-128 over AES-256. If you have a simpler algorithm with a stronger key schedule, why use the more complex one?</span></p>
<h2><span>Picking Between AES-128 and AES-256</span></h2>
<p><span>128-bit and 256-bit AES both have their pros and cons. AES-128 is faster and more efficient and less likely to have a full attack developed against it (due to a stronger key schedule). AES-256 is more resistant to brute force attacks and is only weak against related key attacks (which should never happen anyway).</span></p>
<p><span>Since both algorithms are secure against modern and anticipated future threats, the choice between them doesn’t really matter from a security perspective. Our best guidance is that </span>AES-128 provides more than adequate security while being faster and more resource-efficient but readers who want that extra security provided by greater key sizes and more rounds in the algorithm should choose AES-256.</p>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>

Its usage is split into two roles: one system is set up as the <strong>master</strong> and is responsible for controlling those systems that connect to it. One or more systems are then set up as <strong>minions</strong> that connect to the master and respond to any commands it issues.</p><p>Both master and minions are typically run as root on the systems they are installed on.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Whilst looking at the source code for SaltStack for one of the previously disclosed vulnerabilities at <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">work</a>, I decided to run the source code through <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit">Bandit</a>, a security scanner for Python applications to see how many issues it would find.</p><p>I was expecting to see quite a few results, as it has a relatively large codebase and has existed for several years. However, as can be seen in the screenshot below Bandit showed even more issues than I was expecting including 117 high severity issues.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_214009.png" alt=""><figcaption>Bandit's report for SaltStack Salt</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of these issues are false positives or of little importance to us, and it can take significant time to parse through all the data. For a quick win, I decided to focus my time researching some potential command injections due to several instances of <code>subprocess.Popen</code> used in conjunction with <code>shell=True</code> in the codebase.</p><p>After looking at a few of these that turned out not to be in any way controllable I found one that could be controlled via some clever trickery using process names.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png" alt="" srcset="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 600w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1000w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1089w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This is the vulnerability we're looking for</figcaption></figure><h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2><p>The minion's <code>restartcheck</code> is vulnerable to command injection via a crafted process name when this process has open file descriptors associated with <code> (deleted)</code> at the end of a filename (note the leading space is required). This allows for a local privilege escalation to root from any user able to create files on the minion in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><h3 id="vulnerable-code">Vulnerable Code</h3><p>The vulnerable code is at <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L615">line 615 in restartcheck.py</a> where <code>subprocess.Popen</code> is called with <code>shell=True</code> and a command that can be maniplulated by an attacker:</p><pre><code>cmd = cmd_pkg_query + package
paths = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre><p>Where <code>package</code> is formed from the process name and <code>cmd_pkg_query</code> is one of the following depending on the OS:</p><ul><li>Debian: <code>dpkg-query --listfiles</code></li><li>RedHat: <code>repoquery -l</code></li><li>NILinuxRT: <code>opkg files</code></li></ul><p>If we can insert a bash control character such as <code>;</code> <code>|</code> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> etc into the process name we can trigger the injection when this code is reached.</p><p>However, to reach this code, a process first needs to have a filehandler open to a file with a filename that ends in <code> (deleted)</code>, and this file needs to reside in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><p>The list of forbidden directories can be seen <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L33">here</a>. This deny list immediately rules out some of the more obvious places we might try to use such as <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/dev/shm</code>, however, there are a few common ones that a low privileged user may have access to such as:</p><ul><li><code>/var/crash</code></li><li><code>/var/spool/samba</code></li><li><code>/var/www</code></li></ul><h3 id="process-names">Process names</h3><p>During this research, it turned out that process names can be a surprisingly tricky thing to modify reliably, and a process name listed by <code>ps</code> may not be the same returned by the Python psutil library.</p><p>In Linux, process names can contain any characters (apart from null). Any user can start processes on a system and the process itself can set the process name. They are a good target for command injection vulnerabilities as developers are unlikely to expect process names to contain special characters or injections.</p><p>It is possible to use <code>exec -a </code> to directly set a process name; however, this doesn't work in <code>busybox</code> or <code>sh</code> shells and doesn't appear to show the same name when using <code>psutil</code>. It's also possible to modify the process name by directly manipulating procfs however this also leads to inconsistent results.</p><p>So in the end, the simplest and most consistent way to set a process name is to rename the binary or script being run. As filenames in Linux cannot contain <code>/</code> this restricts the commands we can inject, however using base64 encoding it is trivial to bypass this restriction as shown below:</p><pre><code># If we wanted to copy the shadow file to /tmp we could run this 
cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow

# Convert it to a base64 string
echo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow | base64 -w0

# The result of the conversion
Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK

# The new command we need to run
echo Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK|base64 -d|sh -i

<p><em>Editor’s Note: In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order that announced sanctions on Russian individuals and organizations in response to election interference efforts.</em></p>



<p><em>The list included several notorious hackers, as well as Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Also on the list was a lesser-known organization that left many puzzled: ZOR Security. The company was founded by Alisa Shevchenko, who worked as a virus analytics expert for Kaspersky Labs for several years and was passionate about building a co-working space for hackers and computer geeks. She had also been </em><a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-15-085-01A"><em>credited</em></a><em> by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for assisting Schneider Electric in finding vulnerabilities in their software.</em></p>



<p><em>According to the announcement, Shevchenko’s company was a supplier to the GRU, the group said to be behind the hack on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Shevchenko, who also goes by Alisa Esage, said U.S. authorities were mistaken, and that she had already closed her company. She currently works as an independent researcher, and is the founder of the </em><a href="https://zerodayengineering.com/"><em>Zero-Day Engineering project</em></a><em>, which shares technical knowledge and training on software vulnerability research.</em></p>



<p><em>Shevchenko talked to Recorded Future cyber threat intelligence expert Dmitry Smilyanets last week about her experience in 2016, her favorite vulnerabilities, and what it’s like to be a hacker in Russia. The conversation below, conducted in English, has been lightly edited for clarity:</em></p>



<p><strong>Dmitry Smilyanets: What was your reaction when you found out the U.S. government imposed sanctions on your company, ZOR Security?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alisa Esage:</strong> I tried to keep calm and prevent the major press from portraying me as a kind of dangerous evil bitch that masterminded the hack of the century. Meanwhile, I kept working on my projects.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png" alt="Alysa Esage" width="451" height="353" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png 1024w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-300x236.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-768x603.png 768w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1536x1206.png 1536w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>DS: How did it change your life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I guess it made me a specialist in thriving under U.S. sanctions.</p>



<p><strong>DS: You said authorities were mistaken—in what way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t care about this anymore. People have the right to make mistakes. And the U.S. government likes to sanction everyone to assert power where they don’t have it, so let them.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you still feel the pressure of sanctions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I definitely feel that something is happening, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. If somebody can’t work with me or benefit from my products because they fear the U.S. government, it’s their own problem.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How did you get into cybersecurity and hacking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It all started with my father, Andrey. He was a talented electronics engineer, one of the first in Russia who started to assemble personal computers as a hobby when they were not generally available, based on spare parts and articles published in foreign technical magazines. He taught me to solder when I was 5 years old, I think. So I started reading books about computers and programming in early school and taught myself to code in C++ and x86 assembly language as soon as I got a PC at age 15. While still in school I learned reverse-engineering, solved ‘crackme’ challenges, hacked PC games and coded ‘keygens’ for fun, and participated in the Russian and international underground hacking scene, mostly on the side of low-level software cracking. That was the beginning of it.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you think it’s getting easier or more difficult for people to follow in your path?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It’s a bit of both. When I was getting started, there was very little information available on computer security specifically. The internet was slow, and only a handful of publications might help you, aside from some generic books on computer programming. I recall there was a website named… something about ethical hacking, presumably ran by a woman; the articles published on it inspired me and helped me to get started. Nowadays it’s totally different. The information is abundant. There are thousands of public sources on all topics in computer security, from tutorials for beginners to professional deep technical trainings on advanced topics (like the ones that I teach, offered by my company Zero Day Engineering). This is the easy side.</p>



<p>On the other hand, computer technologies are getting more and more complex, technological developments are accelerating, learning curves are steeper and as a result, it’s getting harder to achieve high levels of expertise in this. It takes more time—years and decades. Remember the old assumption, “hacker equals teenager,” and that a hacking career ought to wrap up before one’s 30th birthday? So untrue today. The majority of the best hackers I know are well into their 30s, and they are just getting started. This is what it takes to gain true mastery in advanced hacking of modern computer systems: a lifetime dedication.</p>



<blockquote><p>For women [hackers] specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love.”</p><cite>— Alisa Esage</cite></blockquote>



<p>Either way, I think that reaching truly advanced levels on this path is more of a destiny than a choice. It takes a very peculiar mindset that seems to be based on genetic data, among other factors, plus special circumstances in life to keep doing the impossible every day. There are plenty of easier ways to thrive and succeed in modern human society than pitching your brain against yet another hardened system. You know that you’re in it when you can’t live without it. And when it happens—congratulations, there is no turning back.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How would you advise other young women to get into a career like yours? What are the pros and cons of being a hacker?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> Find something that excites you, pick a specific task, and solve it until completion. Reflect and repeat. Solving technical tasks and completing them is essential to progress on this path, while passive consumption of information would mostly litter your brain and disrupt your technical creativity. Dedicate yourself to practice, read mostly primary sources (such as technical specifications, classical books, and high-quality blogs from researchers whose work you admire). It’s the same advice for both women and men.</p>



<p>For women specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love. Especially if you already know that deep technical work is your passion, then don’t let anyone side-track you into management, lecturing, report-writing, marketing, or whatever else supportive roles in the cyber industry. Men and women definitely face different challenges in this career path, though it does get better over time (though a lot much slower and to a lesser extent than it’s commonly suggested).</p>



<p>Pros and cons? It’s risky and fun, obviously.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What do you like most about your line of work? What about your least favorite parts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I like the uncertainty, the adversarial environment, hunting for bug bounties, and solving hard challenges. I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas. I dislike that I have to compete with many smart guys, who comprise a dominant majority in this space. Men and women were not made to compete with each other.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What is the coolest vulnerability you ever found?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> A DLL Hijacking remote code execution bug in Outlook Express in Windows XP. It was a long time ago when Windows XP was still in use on every personal computer, and not just on ATMs and POS terminals like nowadays. In my early career in vuln research, I developed a proprietary methodology to discover zero-day bugs of this class and found many issues including the one in OE. For many years after I found it, I used to check if it’s still unpatched and it was. Nowadays it’s probably a “forever-0day”, since XP is EoL. Long-lived and reliable exploits like that are always fascinating.</p>



<p>Nowadays DLL Hijacking issues (also known as Insecure Library Loading) are still very prominent. For instance, a bug of this type was recently patched in Zoom Client for Windows. It’s trivial to find and trivial to exploit. The fact that world-dominating software developers still allow such trivial programming mistakes indicates a severe lack of vulnerability awareness in the global software industry. It’s one of the reasons why my company is developing specialized vulnerability intelligence feeds that (aside from our trainings) should help to bridge this knowledge gap and make the Internet more secure for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>DS: In your opinion, what’s the easiest way to compromise an organization in 2021?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg 400w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-300x300.jpg 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> There is no such way, generally. Organizations are not uniform in their levels of security. What’s truly important to realize is that there exists a spectrum of offensive cyber technologies that may be leveraged to compromise an organization, from trivial to advanced. Attackers would typically go for the weakest link in the system, that can be broken with the easiest tech in the spectrum. As opposed to it, my professional choice is to specialize in the most advanced extreme of it—zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, especially in hardened systems—because once you can solve a hard problem, everything else in the spectrum is a piece of cake. Also, because it’s kind of unstoppable. You can train your employees to avoid clicking on phishing that brings ransomware, you can establish a proper corporate policy to block insiders that deliver supply chain implants and leak your business secrets, but you can’t avoid technology altogether. And technological systems have bugs, that may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. And game over.</p>



<blockquote><p>I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Another key point to realize is that, regardless of a security compromise scenario, the root cause of it is always a …</p></article></div>

<p>Have you heard of <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</strong>?</p>



<p>It’s the condition of being distracted by “shiny” new things.</p>



<p>Fad diets, the latest gadgets, <a href="https://ozchen.medium.com/new-years-resolution-syndrome-db9f52e72a07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endless New Year’s resolutions</a> and yes…<strong>new stocks</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Shiny Stock Syndrome</strong> is the financial version of Shiny Object Syndrome.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever bought a new stock without doing research or feel like you’ve missed on out an investment…then you might have Shiny Stock Syndrome.</p>



<p><em>What if you miss out on the next Amazon, Netflix or Tesla? You don’t wanna be a dunce, do ya???</em></p>



<p>In other words, it’s financial FOMO. </p>



<p><strong>Hi, my name is Oz and I’m a cryptoholic… </strong></p>



<p>During the cryptomania of 2017, I bought several obscure cryptocurrencies thinking they’d simply go up. I did very little research on some of these cryptocurrencies. Some of these, like <a href="https://coin.market/crypto/linda-coin">LINDA coin</a>, are basically defunct. </p>



<p>I lost money. Luckily, I didn’t lose my shirt by holding <a href="https://ozchen.com/cryptocurrency-not-lottery-ticket/">more worthwhile crypto</a>. </p>



<p>That’s how I experienced Shiny Object Syndrome first hand.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution to this pernicious mental condition. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-this-better-than-what-i-already-own">“Is this better than what I already own?”</h2>



<p>Shiny Stock Syndrome is an expression of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novelty effect</a></strong>. This is the bias towards preferring something just because it’s perceived as new. </p>



<p>After all, we like to read “news” …and not “olds.” (Hey, I gotta drop at least 1 dad joke in here.)</p>



<p>To counter the novelty effect, we can take advantage of another bias: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>, which is the preference for something we already own. </p>



<p>Use the endowment effect to pay as much attention to stocks you already own, compared to hot new stocks. </p>



<p>This insight from a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/5-questions-investors-should-ask-themselves-in-202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motley Fool podcast</a> really stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote><p>…for every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well. If I truly don’t feel confident enough to add to any of my existing businesses in my portfolio, then maybe that says to me, “Hey, you should probably sell one of these businesses if you don’t really like it that much.”</p><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>So I’m adding this to my list of heuristics for investing. </p>



<ul><li>If a new stock isn’t <em>more</em> compelling than current stocks, hold or buy more of what I already own</li><li>If my current stock becomes less compelling, then I should be willing to trade it for new stock</li></ul>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to sell a stock you already own. But this is a good thought exercise for <a href="https://ozchen.com/general-specific-framework/">practicing specificity</a>. That can look like…</p>



<ul><li>Listening to CEO interviews and following them on Twitter</li><li>Reading through a company’s financial statements </li><li>Subscribing to a company’s investor relations’ newsletter</li></ul>



<p id="h-stealing-toms-1-for-1-model">To leverage ownership bias for good, <strong>we should be as into our current investments as we are new ones.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p>TOMS Shoes pioneered the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90344987/toms-made-buy-one-give-one-famous-now-its-updating-the-model">One for One model</a> of giving 1 product away for every purchased shoe. </p>



<p><a href="https://ozchen.com/retail-investors-vs-professional-investors/">Individual investors</a> like you and I can <s>borrow</s> steal the One for One model to build conviction in our investments:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>“Any time I want to buy a new stock, I have to buy a stock that I already own. </p><p>For every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well.”</p></div><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yes, this means counteracting Shiny Stock Syndrome with….Stock Hold Syndrome 🤣</p>

CDC has been exchanging data with colleagues across the country and similar results are&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;Quebec, as well as from the U.K., Israel and other countries.</p>  <p>She also said&nbsp;the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been looking at the issue and will be issuing a statement on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>As of March 1, however, the advice&nbsp;NACI is providing on its website says&nbsp;that the interval between the first and second shots of the Moderna vaccine should be four weeks, the interval for Pfizer should be three weeks and the interval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The head of Moderna's Canadian operations, Patricia Gauthier, told Kapelos Monday that the company's own trials, and the conditions under which the vaccine&nbsp;was approved by Health Canada, are tied to a four week interval.</p>  <p>"That being said, we're in times of pandemic and we can understand that there are difficult decisions to be made," Gauthier said. "This then becomes a government decision. We stand by the product monograph approved by Health Canada, but governments ... can make their own decisions."</p>  <p>Gauthier said she is not aware of any studies done or led by Moderna on what happens when the interval between the first and second doses is changed from four weeks to four months.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614633157759_7259"><div><p>On January 6, 2021, an armed mob stormed the US Capitol to prevent the certification of what they claimed was a “fraudulent election.” Many Americans were shocked, but they needn’t have been. The January 6 insurrection was the culmination of months of online mis- and disinformation directed toward eroding American faith in the 2020 election.</p><p>US elections are decentralized: almost 10,000 state and local election offices are primarily responsible for the operation of elections. Dozens of federal agencies support this effort, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. However, none of these federal agencies has a focus on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from domestic sources within the United States. This limited federal role reveals a critical gap for non-governmental entities to fill. Increasingly pervasive mis- and disinformation, both foreign and domestic, creates an urgent need for collaboration across government, civil society, media, and social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Election Integrity Partnership, comprising organizations that specialize in understanding those information dynamics, aimed to create a model for whole-of-society collaboration and facilitate cooperation among partners dedicated to a free and fair election. With the narrow aim of defending the 2020 election against voting-related mis- and disinformation, it bridged the gap between government and civil society, helped to strengthen platform standards for combating election-related misinformation, and shared its findings with its stakeholders, media, and the American public. This report details our process and findings, and provides recommendations for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who We Are: EIP and Its Members</h2><p>The Election Integrity Partnership <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/news/announcing-the-eip"><span>was formed to enable real-time information exchange</span></a> between election officials, government agencies, civil society organizations, social media platforms, the media, and the research community. It aimed to identify and analyze online mis- and disinformation, and to communicate important findings across stakeholders. It represented a novel collaboration between four of the nation’s leading institutions focused on researching mis- and disinformation in the social media landscape:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Graphika&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What We Did</h2><p>The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate. To identify the scope of our work, we built a <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/policy-analysis/platform-policies"><span>framework</span></a> to compare the policies of 15 social media platforms across four categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Procedural interference</em>: misinformation related to actual election procedures</p></li><li><p><em>Participation interference</em>: content that includes intimidation to personal safety or deterrence to participation in the election process</p></li><li><p><em>Fraud</em>: content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to affect the electoral process or illegally cast or destroy ballots</p></li><li><p><em>Delegitimization of election results</em>: content aiming to delegitimize election results on the basis of false or misleading claims&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The EIP used an innovative internal research structure that leveraged the capabilities of the partner organizations through a tiered analysis model based on “tickets” collected internally and from our external stakeholders. Of the tickets we processed, 72% were related to delegitimization of the election.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h4>Misleading and false claims and narratives coalesced into the metanarrative of a “stolen election,” which later propelled the January 6 insurrection.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Right-leaning “blue-check” influencers transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Warped stories frequently centered on mail-in voting and accusations of found, discarded, or destroyed ballots, particularly in swing states. Misleading framing of real-world incidents often took the form of falsely assigning intent, exaggerating impact, falsely framing the date, or altering locale.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The metanarrative of a “stolen election” coalesced into the #StopTheSteal movement, encompassing many of the previous narratives. The narrative appeared across platforms and quickly inspired online organizing and offline protests, leading ultimately to the January 6 rally at the White House and the insurrection at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fact-checking of narratives had mixed results; non-falsifiable narratives presented a particular challenge. In some cases, social media platform fact-checks risked drawing further attention to the claims they sought to debunk.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>The production and spread of misinformation was multidirectional and participatory.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Individuals participated in the creation and spread of narratives. Bottom-up false and misleading narratives started with individuals identifying real-world or one-off incidents and posting them to social media. Influencers and hyperpartisan media leveraged this grassroots content, assembling it into overarching narratives about fraud, and disseminating it across platforms to their large audiences. Mass media often picked up these stories after they had reached a critical mass of engagement.</p></li><li><p>Top-down mis- and disinformation moved in the opposite direction, with claims first made by prominent political operatives and influencers, often on mass media, which were then discussed and shared by people across social media properties.</p></li></ul><h4>Narrative spread was cross-platform: repeat spreaders leveraged the specific features of each platform for maximum amplification.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The cross-platform nature of misinformation content and narrative spread limited the efficacy of any single platform’s response.</p></li><li><p>Smaller, niche, and hyperpartisan platforms, which were often less moderated or completely unmoderated, hosted and discussed content that had been moderated elsewhere. Parler in particular saw a remarkable increase in its active user base, as users rejected the “censorship” they perceived on other platforms.</p></li></ul><h4>The primary repeat spreaders of false and misleading narratives were verified, blue-check accounts belonging to partisan media outlets, social media influencers, and political figures, including President Trump and his family.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>These repeat spreaders amplified the majority of the investigated incidents aggressively across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeat spreaders often promoted and spread each others’ content. Once content from misleading narratives entered this network, it spread quickly across the overlapping audiences.</p></li></ul><h4>Many platforms expanded their election-related policies during the 2020 election cycle. However, application of moderation policies was inconsistent or unclear.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms took action against policy violations by suspending users or removing content, downranking or preventing content sharing, and applying informational labels. However, moderation efforts were applied inconsistently on and across platforms, and policy language and updates were often unclear.</p></li><li><p>Account suspensions and content removal or labeling sometimes contributed to conspiratorial narratives that platforms were “covering up the truth,” entangling platforms with the narratives they wished to eliminate.</p></li><li><p>Lack of transparency and access to platform APIs hindered external research into the effectiveness of platform policies and interventions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Key Recommendations</h2><h3>Federal Government</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish clear authorities and roles for identifying and countering election related mis- and disinformation. Build on the federal interagency movement toward recognizing elections as a national security priority and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create clear standards for consistent disclosures of mis- and disinformation from foreign and domestic sources as a core function of facilitating free and fair elections, including via CISA’s Rumor Control and joint interagency statements.</p></li></ul><h3>Congress</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pass existing bipartisan proposals for increased appropriations marked for federal and state election security.</p></li><li><p>Codify the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s bipartisan recommendations related to the depoliticization of election security and the behavior of public officials and candidates for federal office noted in Volumes <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume3.pdf"><span>3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf"><span>5</span></a> of the Committee’s report on foreign influence in 2016 elections.</p></li></ul><h3>State and Local Officials</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish trusted channels of communication with voters. This should include a .gov website and use of both traditional and social media.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Ensure that all votes cast are on auditable paper records and that efficient, effective, and transparent post-election audits are conducted after each election.</p></li></ul><h3>Platforms</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Provide proactive information regarding anticipated election misinformation.

The solution could be a floating underwater rescue robot, which is intended to support rescue staff in emergencies in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>A research team from the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation IOSB in Ilmenau developed the underwater vehicle with the help of Halle’s water rescue service, Wasserrettungsdienstes Halle e.V.

<br></p><p>According to the German life-saving association, the Deutsche Lebens-Rettungsgesellschaft (DLRG), nearly 420 people drowned in Germany in 2019, with the majority losing their lives in fresh water lakes. However, fatal accidents also occurred in swimming pools. One reason for this is the countrywide lack of trained life-guards to watch over pools. A team of researchers from the Institute for Advanced Systems Technology (AST) of Fraunhofer IOSB is aiming to improve this situation, by developing an aquatic robot, the only one of its kind worldwide. This robot will assist lifeguards and lifesavers, and rescue swimmers in emergencies. The scientists have used their years of expertise in the area of underwater robotics to develop this autonomous system. They have already designed an autonomous underwater vehicle that has won numerous awards – DEDAVE.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a732387377c6f4194941cd5c78c56bc0/6481af0272f478b9-d6/s1280x1920/9f73e363ee978061d0915dafa1040e2de26155ee.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;During testing at the Hufeisensee lake, the dummy did not slip out of the securing mechanism as it was taken to the surface.

The project was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). Surveillance cameras mounted on the swimming pool’s ceiling register the movement patterns and position of the drowning person in the pool, and send the coordinates to the robot. It is safely stored away from prying eyes in a docking station on the swimming pool floor, which opens in an emergency. Once the vehicle has reached its destination, it locates the endangered person and carries them to the surface. A mechanism for fixing the rescuee in place prevents lifeless bodies from sliding down as they surface. This mechanism can also be mounted on other underwater vehicles.</p><h2><b>Successful open-water testing</b></h2><p>At swimming lakes, drones and zeppelin systems take on the task of the surveillance cameras. “These drones and advertising balloons can easily be fitted with cameras,” says Renkewitz. For rescues in swimming lakes where the visibility is restricted, the underwater vehicle must be equipped with acoustic sensors instead of optical ones. Sound wave echoes can be used to determine people’s positions and orientation so precisely that the robot can autonomously head for the target person and pick them up.</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d3f45227310c258d7b8d8e415d0b95ab/6481af0272f478b9-ce/s1280x1920/3cf1c980d7b65cec2c18ac3b4ce2186ec2f254fe.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="1200" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;The aquatic robot transports the dummy to shore via the shortest route.

An 80-kilogram dummy was deposited at a depth of three meters. The robot then picked it up, secured it in place, brought it to the surface within a second, and carried it via the shortest route – a distance of 40 meters – to shore, where the rescue team was already waiting. When the robot is informed of an emergency, a signal alerts the team immediately. “The full rescue operation lasted just over two minutes. Casualties must be resuscitated within five minutes to avoid long-term damages of the brain. We were able to stay within this critical time frame without any problems,” says Renkewitz.</p><h2><b>Future outlook</b></h2><p>Equipped with batteries, motor, cameras, and optical and navigational sensors, the current system is 90 centimeters long, 50 centimeters high, and 50 centimeters wide. The objective of Renkewitz’s team is to further reduce the size of the rescue system and build different versions for use in swimming pools and lakes. They aim to make it smaller, lighter, and more cost-effective than the current prototype, which is based on a pre-existing underwater vehicle. Instead, the future robot will have the streamlined design of a manta ray.</p><figure data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dadbca97136603e8f46501046f78dbb9/6481af0272f478b9-69/s1280x1920/4427008b73e7821cdc4f9218ef3109810e950171.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1500" data-orig-height="843" width="1280" height="719"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prototype modeled on a ray - In the future, the robot will resemble the streamlined cartilaginous fish.

In modified versions, it can take on further tasks – such as offshore and dam wall inspections or being used to monitor the health of fish in fish farms. “Our underwater vehicles have a very broad range of applications. For example, they are also suitable for detecting and verifying archaeological artefacts at the bottom of lakes,” explain the researchers.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2021/march-2021/an-autonomous-underwater-robot-saves-people-from-drowning.html">Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/183243493212/drones-search-and-rescue">Autonomous drones can help search and rescue after disasters</a></p>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
<p><em>March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Today Chrome 89 ships as stable with support for <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">package import maps</a> in browsers. Aligning with this support, a new <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is being launched today as a native modules <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">import map CDN</a> along with an <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online import map generator</a> for creating import maps against the module CDN.</em></p>
<h2>Import Maps Explainer</h2>
<p>Import maps allow defining the locations of modules imported from JavaScript in the browser, effectively like you would expect in any other language (and as is already supported in Node.js):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;
  <span>import</span> pkg <span>from</span> <span>'pkg'</span>;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Before import maps, if you run the above in any browser you would get the following error:</p>
<p><code><span>'Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier <span>"pkg"</span>. Relative references must start with either <span>"/"</span>, <span>"./"</span>, or <span>"../"</span>.'</span></code></p>
<p>This is because unlike other web resources, the JS modules specification for HTML reserved the space of these non-relative references (called "bare specifiers") exactly to allow custom package imports via import maps.</p>
<p>To map this specifier with an import map, we add the new <code><span>"importmap"</span></code> script type to the web page:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"pkg"</span>: <span>"./pkg/main.js"</span>
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And as of today, the above workflow is supported natively in Chromium for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code><span>"imports"</span></code> field in the import map, there is also the <a href="https://github.com/wicg/import-maps#scoping-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code><span>"scopes"</span></code> field</a> which allows for scoping the import mapping (useful when there are naming / version conflicts). Import maps can even map entire resolved URLs which can be useful in mocking workflows.</p>
<h2>The JavaScript Module Caching Tradeoff</h2>
<p>Import maps may seem nice and all, but perhaps they don't actually seem like much of a big deal - do they really solve any production-time technical problems?</p>
<p>The answer is that they do actually solve quite a deep performance problem with JS modules in browsers!</p>
<p>Without import maps, there is a natural caching tradeoff that applies to shipping JS modules in production, something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the web you usually want all URLs to be unique and cached with far-future expires (the fastest request being no request).</li>
<li>We usually achieve this with unique URL schemes by including hashes or a unique build identifier in URLs so that updates don't cause conflicts.</li>
<li>Since modules have to import eachother by name <code>app-a09s8df0.js</code> will end up containing <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code>, and as a result the top-level hash is dependent on the lower-level hashes. A change to a deep dependency changes the <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-s8df79sd.js'</span></code> into a <code><span>import</span> <span>'./dependency-qw97g23s.js'</span></code>, which in turn changes the hash of <code>app-a09s8df0</code> itself because its contents have changed. That is, a deep dependency change invalidates all the parent modules. A small change causes a large invalidation.</li>
<li>So if we want to be able to have cache sharing of parent modules while invalidating dependencies, we may be better off having <code>app.js</code> load <code>dependency.js</code> and then just not using far-future expires.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is thus a complex tradeoff to be made between perfect caching that quickly invalidates with updates, and imperfect caching that might provide better cache sharing for updates.</p>
<p>In comparison to build techniques today the above might not sound so bad, but we shouldn't compare to what we do today - we should compare to the theoretical best case.</p>
<h2>Ideal Modular Caching</h2>
<p>The theoretical ideal for module caching would be for each module to be cached with far future expires, while only being invalidated when that module itself changes.</p>
<p>Import maps can provide us with exactly this property:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=<span>"importmap"</span>&gt;
{
  <span>"imports"</span>: {
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"./dist/app-cvf98b7c.js"</span>
    <span>"dependency"</span>: <span>"./dist/dependency-s9df7987.js"</span>   
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;<span>import</span> <span>'app'</span>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>app.js</code> would contain:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'dependency'</span>;</code></pre>
<p>We now have the ability to independently update either <code>app</code> or <code>dependency</code> using the import map, while having both modules cached with far-future expires.</p>
<p><strong>Import maps bring the possibility of perfect caching for incremental updates of applications on the web.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that coupled with using dynamic <code><span>import</span>()</code> lazy loading for first-load optimization, JS modules can be a pretty good bet for production workflow performance.</p>
<h2>Module CDNs</h2>
<p>Module CDNs take the perfect caching concept and extend it based on the following principle - taking the JS package as both the unit of optimization and the unit of perfect caching.</p>
<p>For a given package and version of that package, we optimize the entire package unit as a whole and host it under a unique URL with the version number.</p>
<p>Import maps applied to this model then allow perfect caching at the level of per-package granularity. The benefit of this being that the optimized package files can be shared between any number of applications since packages are the granularity of usage. In this way it acts as a source of precompiled and optimized JS packages for the browser.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn">ga.jspm.io CDN</a> is being launched to serve this role, with import maps generated by the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Import Map Generator</a>.</p>
<p>This effectively then provides something akin to the npm install workflow that can work natively for browsers, with the import map treated as a sort of lockfile. JSPM as a browser native package manager stems exactly from this principle.</p>
<h2>Support in Other Browsers</h2>
<p>While we wait the years it will take for import maps to be widely supported for browsers other than Chrome 89, there are two production-suitable approaches currently available:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Module Shims</a>: A fast Wasm-based polyfill that just replaces the specifiers with their full URLs while still using the native loader. It's good enough for production in most cases and is used by the JSPM generator web application itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SystemJS</a>: A complete variant of the <code>ga.jspm.io</code> CDN is available serving <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/cdn#systemjs-variant">SystemJS modules</a> at <code>ga.system.jspm.io</code>, available for SystemJS import maps when selecting the "SystemJS Import Map" option from the JSPM Generator. SystemJS provides a workflow where native module semantics can be replicated in all browsers using the SystemJS module fomat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Try it Out</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun building the JSPM Generator using this approach and not having to touch a CLI apart from running a local server in dev and leaving it alone - and I really hope this can make JS development more fun for you too.</p>
<p>Please feel free to ask questions or share feedback - this stuff only works in collaboration. And there is still a lot of work to do. If you're interested in getting involved in the project please get in touch too.</p>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://jspm.org/docs/workflows">workflows here</a> or try out the <a href="https://generator.jspm.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">import map generator</a> directly.</p>

      <p><a href="http://indie.vc/"><span>Indie.vc</span></a><span>, a firm focused on bringing startups to profitability, is shutting down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After six years and nearly 40 startups, one of Silicon Valley’s most unconventional and beloved VC firms is calling it quits, according to a </span><a href="https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09"><span>blog post</span></a><span> by founder Bryce Roberts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re proud of the work we’ve done as investors, brand builders, and movement makers,” Roberts wrote. “We love Indie!...That said, without the institutional support to scale the Indie Economy we envision, it’s time to take our learnings and refocus on other strategies within the portfolio to deploy our capital.”</span></p>
<p><span>Indie.vc became an overnight sensation in Silicon Valley after Roberts (who had been a VC himself for years) published a Tumblr post on what the firm was about back in 2015. Instead of writing founders a huge check for a seed round or a Series A, Indie would use a new investment structure, working with startups on their path to profitability. Roberts didn’t think the concept was so radical — he once told TechCrunch that profitability was more achievable than raising a Series A.</span></p>
<p><span>Indie was part of a wave of founder-friendly VC firms in that they were perceived as not relentlessly marching their investments towards land-grab markets or unicorn-scale growth as fast as possible. Rather, Roberts focused on businesses that were on a path to profitability, and could be helped to get there with an investment that allowed them to not worry so much about their next round. They wanted their investments to have some basis in reality — a product, a corporate structure, revenue — not just drawing board ideas that could either become home runs or strikeouts.</span></p>
<p><span>In this way the fund bucked the trend of most big VC firms on and off Sand Hill Road, where a few monster investments carry along a portfolio of dozens of other bets that may never pan out to a "venture scale" return.</span></p>
<p><span>Several startups to come out of Indie have remained profitable, Roberts wrote, with many generating seven figures in revenue year after year. Indie’s startup mortality rate is 10%, compared with 44% for the rest of venture capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the firm couldn’t continue without more capital from LPs, as many as 80% of whom backed out of supporting Indie. Their reasons usually had something to do with Indie’s break from the VC norm. Roberts even posted an example of the kind of LP rejection Indie often received, which said, “We are out. The shift in strategy for the fund over time (for your good, intentional reasons) has moved further away from the kinds of companies we are looking to have exposure to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After publishing the post, Roberts tweeted about the outpouring of support he received after Indie’s demise.</span></p>
<div><p><span>“You pour yourself into something so completely for so long and then it doesn’t work out how you’d hoped and have to lay bare your failure while bracing for the worst,” Roberts wrote in a tweet.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<p><em>author: niplav, created: 2019-04-02, modified: 2020-06-01, language: english, status: in progress, importance: 3, confidence: likely</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Two people are abducted and placed on the opposite poles of a
  habitable planet. They want to find each other, but they have no
  way to communicate. The only things they know is their their own
  respective position on the planet and the position of the equator and
  the poles. Here, different methods for finding each other under similar
  conditions are explained and discussed, and a deterministic method
  for finding each other is introduced.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The original problem is taken from <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf" title="“Lost Immortals“ (Randall
Munroe 2014)">Munroe
2014</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If two immortal people were placed on opposite sides of an uninhabited
  Earthlike planet, how long would it take them to find each other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a>, <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/lost_immortals_munroe_2014.pdf">“Lost Immortals” in “What If?”, p. 183</a>, 2014</em></p>

<p>Here, I add several clarifications to the problem.</p>

<p>For the following ideas, it is not necessary that the planet is
earth-like, but it is assumed that the planet has a relatively flat
surface, lacking oceans, where the two people can leave footprints.</p>

<p>Each of the two people has the following abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Know their own position on the planet</li>
<li>Walk at approximately the same speed</li>
<li>Reason about the other person</li>
<li>Leave footprints on the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>Both lack all other abilities, including (but not limited to) creating
new technology and communicating when they are out of sight (no fireworks,
launching spaceships etc.).</p>

<p>Both people are typical, but had no opportunity to communicate with
each other beforehand. They can reason about each others' strategy and
behavior, but have no intricate knowledge about each others decision
process (if they are artificial agents, they don't know each others'
algorithm).</p>

<p>These two people want to find each other.</p>

<h2>Different Existing Solutions</h2>

<h3>Munroes Solutions</h3>

<p>Munroe proposes different solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walk around at random: He states that they would find each other within 3000 years (though no explicit calculation is provided).</li>
<li>Agree beforehand to meet at a specific point on the planet (such as the highest mountain, one of the poles etc.).</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents. This is not applicable here, because it is assumed that there are no oceans.</li>
<li>Follow the coastlines of the continents, but after each circling, decide randomly whether to switch direction or resume the known path.</li>
<li>Walk at random, while leaving a trail of signs with increasing counter along the way, increasing ones speed when finding an unknown trail.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Proposed Solutions</h3>

<p>A very similar problem was discussed in a Mathematics Stack
Exchange post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you and your friend end up on a big sphere. There are no visual
  cues on where on the sphere you both are, and the sphere is way bigger
  than you two. There are no means of communication. You can determine
  your relative position and direction by navigating the stars. You can
  move anywhere, and your friend too. <br>
  Upon inspecting the sphere, you see it is rock-solid, so you cannot
  create markings. To protect the environment, you are not allowed to
  leave other stuff, like a blood trace or breadcrumbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/53495/robau">RobAu</a>, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1214022/fastest-way-to-meet-without-communication-on-a-sphere/">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>In this problem, marking are not possible, and players don't start at
the opposite sides of the planet (which makes a solution a lot harder).</p>

<h4>Moving at Random, but Changing Directions Rarely</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Move at random. [...]
  you could prefer to walk longer distances in a straight line as opposed

<p>This solution does not need any prerequisites.</p>

<h4>Exhaustive Search, Moving in Spirals</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the first thing to do is to calculate the size of the sphere (by
  picking a direction and walking until you arrive back at the start point
  or some other, more efficient technique). At that point, you can work out
  an exhaustive search pattern and the duration to perform one (a spiral
  pattern is close to optimal but difficult for a human to perform). That
  duration becomes your frequency of decision making.
  Once per period, you flip a coin. Heads, you do an exhaustive
  search. Tails, you stay put. Each of the longer period (e.g. the less
  efficient search pattern), you have a 50/50 chance of doing the opposite
  of your partner and thus discovering each other in the course of the
  exhaustive search.</p>

<p>This is similar to the strategy of randomly switching positions, but
without opposite starting positions. It assumes one can adequately
calculate the circumference of the sphere, which is not a given, and it
assumes that the person can generate random bits.</p>

<h4>Randomizing Speed While Keeping Direction</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think a better strategy is to pick a direction (any will do), stick
  to it and randomise your speed. <br>
  If both parties do this their paths will cross twice each orbit (unless
  they are on the same orbit in which case they will meet sooner due to
  randomised speed) <br>
  if you go full random changing direction as well as velocity you aren't
  guaranteed to ever cross the path of the other. (although as t gets large
  it becomes increasingly likely that your paths will cross at least once.) <br>
  Speed randomisation is necessary to avoid never meeting because of resonance.</p>

<h4>Find a Schelling Point</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would posit that a better-than-random solution would include finding
  the most "interesting" such configuration (so first you have to map
  them all by traveling the sphere methodically) and heading there as a
  Schelling point.</p>

<p><em>– <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/54545/qwertronix">Qwertronix</a>, answer to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1214322">“Fastest way to meet, without communication, on a sphere?”</a>, 2015</em></p>

<p>This solution is similar to most practical solutions to these kinds
of problems. It assumes that there <em>is</em> a most interesting star
configuration, the size of such a configuration, and a given metric
on how to determine the interesting-ness of such a configuration.
The metric is the least difficult of them: given a size of the region
of sky, the most interesting such region would be the one that is the
most compressible (or most regular). The size aspect of this possible
configuration is much more difficult: Where does such a configuration
end? One possible answer is: "At the horizon.", then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)">Schelling
point</a> would
be the point where the whole sky is most interesting.</p>

<h3>Randomly Switching Positions</h3>

<p>Another solution is possible due to the fact that both people start out
at the opposite sides of the planet. Each person determines randomly
whether they should travel to the opposite side of the planet or stay
at ones own side for the duration of such a travel. This drastically
decreases the time until meeting, since the chance of not having met after
n such iterations the chance of having met is <code>$1-\frac{1}{2^n}$</code>. Munroe
proposes coin flips to determine whether one changes position, but one
can imagine other such methods if coins are not available.</p>

<p>One could assign the choice of staying to the left body half and
the choice of going to the other side of the planet to the right
body half, and then choosing the strategy based on which part of the
body itches first. This would be useful since humans are notoriously
bad at consciously generating random bits (see <a href="https://niplav.github.io/doc/two_people_on_a_planet/humans_cannot_consciously_generate_random_numbers_sequences_figurska_et_al_2008.pdf" title="Humans cannot consciously generate random numbers sequences: Polemic study">Figurska et al.
2007</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, this method could be biased, since many humans have
points on their skin that are constantly itchy.</p>

<h2>A Better Solution</h2>

<p>A better solution is possible because both people start out at the
opposite sides of the planet, and know their own respective position on
the planet.</p>

<p>Taking their own position as one pole, they could infer an equator as
the set of points on the planet that is equally far away from each of
their positions. They would then both proceed to go to this equator
and start walking along it.</p>

<p><img src="https://niplav.github.io/img/two_people_on_a_planet/sphere.png" alt="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere" title="Two agents move to the equator of a sphere. They both start at opposing poles of the planet."></p>

<p>Then each person could follow the following algorithm: If they had
walked less than half of the circumference of the planet, and encountered
footsteps, they would reverse direction. If they had walked more than
half of the circumference of the planet, they would continue walking no
matter whether they would see other footsteps on the ground.</p>

<p>This would ensure that they would deterministically meet in <code>$\cal{O}(n)$</code>
(<code>$n$</code> being the circumference of the planet).</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>

<p>This code does not deal with the possibility that the other agent doesn't
use the same method, or that they don't arrive at the equator at the
same time.</p>

<pre><code>circumference=4*walk_to_equator() /* circumference in steps */

set_marker() /* in case footsteps are not visible after some time */
equator_steps=0

while met_person()==false
    walk_step()
    equator_steps++
    if marker_visible==true and steps_on_equator&lt;circumference/2
        turn_around()
</code></pre>

<h2>Why it Works</h2>

<p>Here, it is assumed that they both reach the equator at the same time.</p>

<p>If both start walking towards each other, the algorithm succeeds:
Both can walk at most half of the length of the equator upon meeting
each other in the extreme case, namely, starting back to back and not
realizing it. In this case, the last part of the method is not applied,
because both will walk less than half of the length of the equator in
any case. In this case, finding each other takes at most <code>$\frac{3}{4}$</code>
of the time it takes to walk across the whole equator (including the
walk from the starting point to the equator).</p>

<p>If they both start walking in the same direction, the method still
succeeds: one of the two people has a distance of less than half of the
length of the equator to the starting point of the other person.</p>

<p>Hello. It’s me, <em>Artist Formerly Known As Lead Maintainer of <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam">Foam</a></em>.</p>

<p>You may remember me from such hits as “feverishly astroturfing a community around an early-stage open source project and then disappearing into the thin air without any kind of acknowledgement that anything had ever happened.”</p>

<p>This is that acknowledgement, followed by some thoughts about the future of Foam.</p>

<p>I’ve organized this article in three parts, so that if you don’t have time to read the whole thing, you can jump to the part that interests you the most:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="#present">Present</a></strong>, where we look at the current state of Foam.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#past">Past</a></strong>, where I offer a personal account of my involvement, and subsequent non-involvement, in Foam, and hopefully learn something for the third act.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#future">Future</a></strong>, where we discuss what could be ahead for Foam.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="present">Present</h2>

<p>Presently, I don’t presume to have any control over the Foam project.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t presume to be able to speak for the project at all. In my absence, <a href="https://github.com/riccardoferretti">Riccardo Ferretti</a>, who was one of the first people to contribute to Foam, has stepped in as the project’s lead maintainer. Since October, he’s improved Foam massively by his own code contributions, while also coordinating the work of others. By this point, Riccardo has put as much work into the project as I have, and as such has very much earned the right to speak for it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Riccardo and I reconnected, and we’ve discovered our experiences maintaining Foam have been in many ways similar. In fact, in the previous paragraphs, when I’ve been using the first-person plural pronoun “we”, it hasn’t been just a rhetorical device. This piece was co-authored by Riccardo and I, and together, as the author and the maintainer of the project, we can proudly say:</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Foam sucks.</strong></p>

<p>I initially created Foam with the goal of building the best networked note taking app. Right now it’s not even the best networked note taking extension installed in my VS Code. This might seem like a technical problem, but in our experience, the root cause is fundamentally organizational.</p>

<p><strong>The way we’ve ran the Foam project is not productive in the short term, and not sustainable in long term.</strong></p>

<p>We both want to make Foam better in the <a href="#future">future</a>, and we have some ideas on how to get there. But before we get to it, I want to take a self-indulgent detour to the past, and tell you how I came to walk away from Foam last September.</p>

<h2 id="past">Past</h2>

<p>Here’s a quick timeline of my personal involvement in Foam</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the 19th of June 2020, I made the first commit to what was going to become Foam.</li>
  <li>One week later, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jevakallio/status/1276098596111290370">launched publicly on Twitter</a>. By the end of that week, Foam held the #1 position on Hacker News, Product Hunt, <strong>and</strong> GitHub, which brought in a lot of attention to a project that was not set up to receive it.</li>
  <li>By early July I was working 16 hour days between Foam and my day job. I was also receiving daily calls from major venture capital firms who wanted to invest into turning Foam into the Next Big Thing in personal note-taking.</li>
  <li>By early August, I decided that I wanted to build Foam into a best-in-class product, but do it on my own terms. So I said <em>fuck you</em> to the man, quit my job, declined all investment offers, and planned to transition to working on Foam full-time on September 1st.</li>
  <li>On September 1st, I simply couldn’t get out of bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>So when people ask, why did you stop working on Foam, the answer is easy: <strong>I had no choice in the matter</strong>. Almost overnight I went from wanting to spend my every waking hour working on Foam, to not being able to pick up my laptop and look at another pull request or Discord message.</p>

<p>Except it didn’t really happen overnight. In retrospect, towards the end of the summer my manic working schedule had itself become a type of raging against the dying of the light. The surest recipe for burnout is getting stuck in a loop where you have to expend increasing amounts of effort for diminishing returns. Every day you feel like you have to work harder, because the day before you didn’t achieve what you set out to do.</p>

<p>Burnout is a devious disease, because it becomes the filter through which you see the world. With Foam, I was building a Second Brain to store my knowledge, but what I needed was a second brain to observe my first malfunctioning brain, and tell it that it needs help.</p>

<p>It’s almost embarrassing to admit to having burned out on open source. When you burn out in your corporate career, you can shake your fist at capitalism, and people can relate. But open source?</p>

<p><em>“You did <strong>what</strong> mate? You turned a fun hobby into a responsibility and spiralled into catatonic depression over a few GitHub stars? Good job!”</em></p>

<p>As a maintainer of a popular open source project, it’s hard not to feel the weight of the collective expectations of the users, contributors and spectators of your project on your shoulders.</p>

<p>This is not a complaint about “entitled users”: Whether or not any individual contributor actually asks for your time, attention or care, you feel indebted to give it to them all. Well, I don’t know about you. I did, anyway.</p>

<p>Which finally brings us to something resembling a point:</p>

<p>An open source project can become just as toxic and stressful as a corporate workplace, when it’s poorly managed. <strong>I ended up leaving Foam because I had created a fundamentally unsustainable environment and then tried to sustain it until I no longer could.</strong></p>

<h3 id="dynamics-of-open-source">Dynamics of Open Source</h3>

<p>In her excellent book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54140556-working-in-public">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">Nadia Eghbal</a> categorizes open source projects into four categories: federations, stadiums, clubs, and toys.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>High User Growth</th>
      <th>Low User Growth</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>High Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Federations <em>e.g. Rust</em></td>
      <td>Clubs <em>e.g. Astropy</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Low Contributor Growth</strong></td>
      <td>Stadiums <em>e.g. Babel</em></td>
      <td>Toys <em>e.g. ssh-chat</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What I wanted Foam to be was a <strong>Federation</strong>: A Populous, plentiful ecosystem, packed with diverse ideas loosely affiliated projects that would scale without central bottlenecks. Instead it became a <strong>Stadium</strong>, with a bunch of people running from the rafters onto the field trying to kick the ball to the direction they thought it should.</p>

<p>Where we ended up was the worst of both worlds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By our own principles, we decried central governance, and therefore gave up the ability to draw a box around of what Foam is and isn’t.</li>
  <li>Because we lacked a cohesion of ideas, we weren’t able to build infrastructure on top of which people could build their individual, decentralized projects while remaining interoperable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were trying to build an infinitely large platform in the middle of a ever-shifting ocean of ideas</p>

<p>For this project to ever reach its stated goals, this will have to change.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>When I wrote Foam’s <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles">Principles</a>, the goal was to build a software platform that would make it easier for people to solve their own problems, while contributing to a shared commons that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>What I’ve since learned is that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong> does not mean anyone is free to introduce ideas and features that significantly change the scope of the project and we should simply accept them, or try our best to fit them in our vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong> does not mean we should accept low-quality contributions that increase the maintenance burden of the project, because in most cases, the contributor is not going to stick around to maintain it, and that burden will fall on us.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every successful software abstraction creates value by defining a set way of doing things, and provides tools to achieve them. In order to do this, they also define what is not possible within this abstraction.</p>

<p>Because we didn’t understand this early on, Foam quickly became a collection of loosely affiliated projects, ideas and approaches to note taking, sometimes incompatible with each other — far from the platform we envisioned.</p>

<p>To fix this, we have to draw some lines in the sand, so that we can make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Foam, the product” better in the short term,</li>
  <li>“Foam, the project” more feasible to develop in the medium term, and</li>
  <li>“Foam, the community” more sustainable for its maintainers and users in the long term</li>
</ul>

<p>Riccardo and I have compared what we’ve learned, and we have decided to join forces to work on the following approaches.</p>

<h3 id="refocus">Refocus</h3>

<p>Going forward, we want to be more intentional about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What Foam really is (and isn’t)</li>
  <li>Who Foam is for (and who it isn’t for)</li>
  <li>Which use cases Foam caters for (and which it unapologetically does not)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the end of this journey, <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam">foambubble/foam</a> will be a leaner, and more centralized project.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Some features will move to their own, officially-unsupported repositories, where anyone who deeply cares about them may adopt them.</li>
  <li>Others features, that belong to the bucket of what “Foam isn’t”, may be killed outright.</li>
  <li>We will kill the defunct <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/rfcs">RFC</a> process (it was never <em>really</em> there anyway).</li>
  <li>We will also update the project’s documentation and contribution guidelines to be clearer on what types of contributions will be welcome to Foam’s core.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a closing of the gates. Quite the opposite. What we want to do is to build the infrastructure of the commons.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-of-the-commons">Infrastructure of The Commons</h3>

<p>The stated goal of Foam has not changed. <strong>What we want is to enable <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> and its community of people to more effectively solve their own problems, explore a constellation of ideas, and contribute them back to a commons.</strong></p>

<p>That requires being more than glue. It requires becoming a solid platform, and in order to do this, we’ll:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bring core features in-house</strong>, to provide a strong networked note taking experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Open the Foam API</strong> so that third-party extensions can build on top of the Foam knowledge graph model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, we’ve co-managed document linking and data visualization with other extensions, but for Foam to be able to build on top of its own platform, we need to reduce the amount of Lowest Common Denominator constraints set by supporting the projects and their nuances.</p>

<p>The next major evolution Foam will no longer require you to install other extensions for document linking and navigation. We aim to provide a more coherent …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-560368d843630fd9268b"><div><p>In my current role, I spend the bulk of my day interacting with CTOs who are hiring engineers and learning about their companies, engineering philosophies, and specific gaps in their team. I know a lot about the universe of potential jobs that exist for engineers at a per company, per role level, but ultimately almost nothing about if a particular individual should accept a particular job offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Every day, I talk to at least one engineer who’s deciding if a startup job offer is right for them. And every day I point them towards a decision-making framework they can use, inspired by the Commit team’s experience choosing roles, as well as by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokulrajaram1/"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-de-beer-a9091b1/"><span>Marius de Beer</span></a>.</p><p>Gokul Rajaram is a software engineer, former startup CEO, has led product at Square and DoorDash, sits on the board of The Trade Desk, Pinterest and Coinbase, and an investor/advisor to dozens of companies, including Poshmark. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for running great All Hands meetings. <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul sat down with Commit in October</span></a> to share his thoughts on today’s challenges and opportunities for startups.</p><p>Marius de Beer is a mechanical and software engineer, with a decade of experience as an agile coach. He is also Commit’s go-to-resource for setting company values.</p><h2><strong>A Framework for deciding on a startup job offer</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Is a startup the right choice for you?</strong></h3><p>There is a startup subculture that can make it feel like the obvious best option - Hacker News, TechCrunch, Twitter, etc cover startups with excitement and a sense of possibility that a public company doesn’t always receive. This atmosphere provides a valuable sense of meaning and camaraderie for startup employees, but it doesn’t mean that joining a startup is the absolute best decision.</p><p>Ask yourself, how important is stability in both your role and your company? Are you looking to optimize your cash compensation number? How much do you value work-life balance and boundaries? If those things are very important to you, you likely would prefer a more mature company (<a href="https://visible.vc/blog/startup-funding-stages/"><span>series C or later</span></a>). But if those are less important to you than growth, autonomy and creativity, then you aren’t likely to feel that you’re making a sacrifice by joining a startup.</p><p>You should think about compensation as more than just the base cash salary. The earlier stage company you join, the more your potential equity could be worth. You have to determine for yourself if you’re willing to sacrifice some base cash salary today for potential equity growth down the road. And regardless of how important compensation is to you, “you must ensure that the total compensation in a role lets you take care of yourself and your family.”&nbsp; - Marius de Beer</p><p>No startup is worth putting yourself into debt for.</p><h3><strong>2. Is the team not just VC-backable, but a group that you will thrive working with?</strong></h3><p>As an ex-VC, I felt a bit guilty realizing there were companies that I would invest in, but not work at. However, I realized that each of us have unique cultural attributes and personality traits, which companies similarly embody. I think it is table stakes to believe in management and their ability to lead and to like and respect the people with whom you will work alongside. But those factors alone don’t tell you if a company’s culture and values align with you, and will set you up to thrive.</p><p>We’ve built a list of attributes at Commit that we score engineers and companies against - you may find it helpful to see which attributes are core to your personality, and look for those attributes in the job descriptions and values of companies that you’re considering.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>You are motivated by autonomy and independence</p></li><li><p>You feel a deep responsibility for code quality</p></li><li><p>You are customer-obsessed</p></li><li><p>You are most concerned with</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Business context informing product decisions;</p></li><li><p>Stability and performance;</p></li><li><p>Solving hard technical problems; or</p></li><li><p>Beautiful design;&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>You do best in opinionated, debate-heavy cultures versus you do best in organizations with clear top-down decision making</p></li><li><p>You prefer to work asynchronously via written communication versus you prefer to work through conversation</p></li><li><p>You want to lead and grow teams versus you want time and space to do your best work as an individual contributor</p></li><li><p>You thrive during setbacks and moments of transition versus you prefer to be insulated from shocks</p></li><li><p>Work is a source of identity to you</p></li><li><p>You want to hone your craft versus you are energized by exposure to unfamiliar technical patterns, systems, or languages</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of these values, you should look for a team that is mission-oriented. A founder who embodies a mission has a deeply held conviction about why the company exists, what it aims to accomplish, and whom it helps. They emote this in their communication and - most importantly - they use the mission as a litmus test for tough decisions.</p><p>“When you talk to a CEO, you need to understand why they’re leading this type of company, and do they really believe in the mission themselves? Do they epitomize the mission? If you talked to Larry [Page], who was the CEO when I joined Google, you could see how deeply he believed in the mission. He was Mr. Search. He believed deeply in technology and investing in deep technology.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>3. Does this role advance your personal and career growth goals?</strong></h3><p>Your goals may be related to power, title, scope of work (ie. moving into a manager track or staying on the IC path), learning, creativity, and agency. Determine where you see yourself in 1, 3 and 5 years, and ask yourself if this role takes you closer to those goals or farther away.</p><p>Marius de Beer’s framework is to ask yourself:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>What do you want to accomplish and see on your EP/LinkedIn profile in 18 months’ time? Describe it in a short paragraph.</p></li><li><p>Now, imagine you put that statement at the centre of a mind map. List below the possible success factors to achieve that statement. In other words, how would you know if you were successful at achieving this goal? Prioritize this list.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>What are the necessary pre-conditions to achieve those items? Again, prioritize this list. Be clear with the people who offer you the new opportunity that these pre-conditions exist - otherwise you will not be successful.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Are you excited to wake up every day and think about this problem space?</strong></h3><p>This applies even if you realized through question two that work is not a source of identity to you. Every day you will wake up to a new problem that must be solved. Do you like thinking about the problem? Is it satisfying when a breakthrough pops into your head in the shower or is it an intrusion? Will this company have an impact on an issue that is important to you? Are you interested in the product/service, or empathetic towards those who are interested in it?</p><p>Everyone will have a different philosophy on how important this problem space must be to them. Some will only want to work in an industry that is their most important issue. (Those people often start companies so you can expect this to be the most important problem space to the founders!)</p><p>“On the mission side, I realized that missions that resonate with me are the missions that are fairly universal and broad. At Google, the mission is around making information democratized and accessible. At Facebook it was around connecting the world. At Square it was around making commerce easy and helping small and medium-sized businesses and individuals—economically empowering them.” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>5. Do you believe that the company will succeed?</strong></h3><p>Everyone has a different tolerance for how much the company must have succeeded to date, but you will want to have confidence that the company can succeed. There are simple signals like credibility with customers and notable partners, or performance against commonly accepted metrics.</p><p>“To judge if a company is on the right path, I really try to understand the business model and know what metrics to look for. Andreessen Horowitz has a good resource for different types of business models - <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/"><span>https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/</span></a>.” - Thomas Zhou, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>“I’m a big fan of Amy Hoy’s techniques about uncovering customer pain and studying a market (going from pain to product).&nbsp; The business team should deeply understand the market you’re in, the pains your audience experiences, and what they care about/how they solve their problems. That should guide every product decision.” - Thiago Araujo, Graduated Engineering Partner.</p><p>If you’re evaluating a very early-stage startup, there may not be any metrics or business traction at all. This is when you can lean on the founders, why they found the problem worth solving, and what is motivating them to build this company (a good answer is ‘to solve the problem’, while a worrying answer is ‘for the glory of being a CEO’).</p><p>“My ideal scenario is finding founders who come from the space the company is trying to solve a problem for. They were the ones who ran into the problem in their day-to-day and found that it was worthwhile enough to quit their jobs and start a company to solve it.” - Hai Hoang, Graduated Engineering Partner</p><p>“The most successful startups have a founder with a unique and non-obvious insight on this market.” You’ll know within an hour of speaking with them - ‘Aha!’ that’s the non-obvious insight about the market!” - <a href="https://blog.commit.dev/articles/gokul-rajaram-talks-with-commit"><span>Gokul Rajaram</span></a></p><h3><strong>6. Marius de Beer’s Final Test. Do you say 'yes' or 'no'?</strong></h3><p>Imagine you walk into the office of your current boss to tell them you are leaving. You haven't signed the new offer at this point so there's no legal or ethical conflict. Their response is to say to you: “I’ll give you everything you’ve been offered and everything that you want out of that new job”. Do you say 'Yes' or 'No'?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes? You're not ready to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>No? It’s time to go make a difference somewhere else.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmarion/"><span><em>Sarah Marion</em></span></a><em> leads Founder Partnerships at Commit. She’s spent her career collaborating with early stage founders as they solve valuable problems.</em></p><p><strong>We hire Software Engineers to build their careers with promising early-stage startups. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One summer I was staying in a hotel in the coastal North African town of Hammamet. My first evening there, and while I was in the lobby, I met a Saudi Arabian chemistry professor drinking a beer and surfing the web using an <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/8thgenerationipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPad</a>. We talked and it turned out we shared some interests. One of these was politics. As we progressed in our chitchat one question popped up into my mind—one that I’d been curious about and more curious hearing a Saudi’s opinion on the issue. So, in the middle of the conversation, I threw at him a question: “Don’t you think that one day Iran and Saudi Arabia would be strong allies, the way Israel and America are, collaborating with each other militarily and economically? I can’t stop thinking how the Middle East would look like if they do so, and more importantly, who’s best interest is served when Saudi Arabia and Iran always stay in conflict?”<br>&nbsp;The guy was surprised by the question thrown at him, and he simply ignored the possibility. “Why not, “I thought to myself. I still think about the possibility to this day. You may say that it’s not possible because of “history”. Well history is in the making as long as the world and mankind coexist. When The Suez Canal Company built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suez Canal</a> in the late 19th century, history changed. The same thing happened when the US built <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal" target="_blank">The Panama Canal</a>. Both Canals altered geography and history—in that same order.</p>



<blockquote><p>Sustainable peace and security require good bilateral relations and regional cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh. Iran and Saudi Arabia have significant differences, but they share common interests in many critical issues, such as energy security, nuclear nonproliferation, and Middle East stability.</p><cite>Hossein Mousavian, author of <a href="http://benwajdi.com/go/bookhosseinmousavianiranandus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iran and the United States: An Insider’s View on the Failed Past and the Road to Peace</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>As I am writing this in my daily journal, Biden, and after 5 weeks inside the White House, has just announced more American sanctions on Russia (Because of an attempted Alexei Navalny assassination by poisoning). He has just bombed Iranian targets in Syria (while trying to negotiate with Iran). He is also putting more and more pressure on Saudi Arabia after The US Intelligence came to the conclusion—one that was intentionally communicated to the public—that Mohammed Bin Salman (aka MBS) was the one pulling the strings, orchestrating the Jamal Kashuqgi’s murder in Turkey, an event that neither journalists nor the people of Istanbul will ever forget.</p>



<p>Nothing is impossible in politics. But, it seems the possibility of Iran and Saudi Arabia becoming regional allies, getting together, and going over all the conflicts of the past, is unlikely to happen in the near future—though I think it is still possible, under the right circumstances.</p>

          <p>Sorry for not replying, Rob, I was super busy with fixing things. This is purely a technical problem, not a financial one, which is kind of how I got into the situation.

<p>The service is now partially restored, but heavily rate-limited at least for the next week or so, until I manage to separate some parts of the backend.</p>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>With the exception of exchanges, scammers, YouTube channels and news sites full of filler and ads, and whales like Michael Saylor, it would seem hardly anyone is making money with cryptocurrency. Despite Bitcoin going from $10k to $40k in less than two months, one is still hard-pressed to find many success stories or evidence of ordinary people getting rich buying and holding or trading crypto. A few days ago I scanned the popular Reddit subs r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency for posts of people who had made sizable sums of money with crypto, and I only found two: someone who had bought a $10,000 Omega watch with their crypto gains, and someone else who made $63,000. Sure, this is better than nothing , but not exactly life-changing amounts of money, especially given how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. By contract, on /r/wallstreetbets there are pages up pages of people making hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars seemingly effortlessly with stock options and with buy and hold. Sure, some on /r/wallstreetbets lose a fortune too, but even in spite of large losses, it would seem that there is far more wealth to be made with stock trading compared to cryptocurrency. It is not even close. I had to dig through dozens of pages to find even just a handful of people who had made a sizable amount of money with crypto, whereas on /r/wallstreetbets it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Where are the millionaires? Surely there must be some. This is not to say that no one has gotten rich with crypto. There are people who bought Bitcoin from 2010-2013 and are sitting on large fortunes. But one would think that there would be dozens of posts every week from newly-minted crpyto millionaires bragging about their gains. One explanation is that bragging this incurs the risk of having your funds stolen, but it is not like you can break into someone’s cold storage wallet from a Reddit account. I imagine that anyone with a fortune would know how to share a screenshot or make a post without compromising their crypto.</p>
<p>So why has crypto been such a loser despite the bull market over the past 2 years, especially compared to stocks? Why aren’t people making money with crypto, but stock trading millionaires are a dime a dozen? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Crypto has too much volatility and hence poor risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks. Whereas many stocks and indexes tend to exhibit a gentle rising slope over the duration of the post-2009 bull market, punctuated by a deep but brief dip due to Covid, crypto tends to zig and zag unpredictably. This is bad for many reasons: too much volatility makes it harder, psychologically, to stay in the market without panic selling at a loss or taking profits too soon. Although bitcoin may have higher absolute returns compared to the Nasdaq , the volatility is considerably higher. This also makes it harder to apply leverage strategies, further minimizing returns. If the Nasdaq has 25% annual returns but 10% draw-downs vs. 50% returns for Bitcoin but 30% drawdowns, you can use 4-1 leverage on the Nasdaq and make 100% in a year with a 40% maximum draw-down, but even applying 2-1 leverage on Bitcoin will give you 100% return but a 60% maximum draw-down. Clearly, stocks provide better risk-adjusted returns with leverage.</p>
<p>Leveraged stock strategies such as buying and holding 3x ETFs such as FNGU,TQQQ, and TECL, have outperformed Bitcoin since 2018. In early 2018, when Bitcoin was at $12k or so, I recommended FNGU as an alternative to Bitcoin (as a sort of high-risk but high return investment). Three years later, FNGU is up over 500% vs. 350% for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. No options market with crypto. Stock options allow small returns of the underlying index or stock to be magnified, but options trading is still very limited with crypto. It is possible, but it does not work nearly as well as stock option trading.</p>
<p>3. Too hard and cumbersome to deposit and withdrawal large sums of and crypto and or fiat. Even after 911, given all of the Patriot Act restrictions, I found it very easy to deposit money in a brokerage account and begin trading. All I had to do was wire money to the broker and within 3 days I was able to trade. With crypto, often you need ID cards and proof of funds due to various arbitrary compliance and anti-money laundering restrictions and regulations. Prior to 2017, it was easy to transfer funds and crypto in and out of exchanges, but criminals inevitably abused and exploited the good will of exchanges. That is usually what happens with these sort of things: all it takes is a few bad actors to permanently ruin it for everyone else. Two decades later, we still have to take off our shoes at the airport because someone had the brilliant idea of smuggling a bomb in their shoe.</p>
<p>4. Too small of position sizes. On /r/wallstreetbets it is not uncommon to see traders in their 20s or 30s make bets of ten thousand dollars or more on a single option trade. Yet for some reason with crypto everyone is skinflint and risk averse. It’s like “I deposited $50 into my Coinbase” is the norm. You’re not going to get rich with such as small investment even if Bitcoin goes up 100x. It is the same age group and demographic buying stock as buying crypto, so it’s not like the crypto traders should have less money.</p>
<p>5. Gains do not hold. GME stock started at $3 in 2020 and a year later is still above $100. Stocks tend to ‘trend’ which means that past price movement predicts future direction. If a stock has risen 70 out of the past 100 days, likely it will keep rising, at least for the foreseeable future. This is known as momentum, and there is evidence that in spite of the efficient market hypothesis, that it exists. With crypto, sometimes an altcoin will get pumped 100% in a day and then the next day give up most of its gains, and then a week later be back to where it started. It is hard to make money off that because there is no follow-through or trend to ride higher. It s not like Gsamestock, which kept going up for many months, or, like Tesla, which went from $70 to $900 over 2 years.</p>
<p>6. As discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-good-investment/">earlier</a>, crypto is more like a commodity than a stock. Whereas stocks tend to generate shareholder value in the form of retained earnings, dividends, or buybacks, crypto does not generate earnings that can be passed on to investors. Also, crypto has more inflation than stocks, as some inflation (between 2-5%) is built into crypto protocols, whereas with stocks the supply tends to shrink over time due to buybacks. Historically, for these reasons, commodities tend to have far worse returns than stocks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		


<p>You've installed Linux (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) into an UEFI bhyve guest on FreeBSD, only to be greeted with a message about PXE boot after restarting from the installer:</p>

<p>BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0001 "UEFI BHYVE SATA DISK BHYVE-48FF-992B-D5E0" from PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x4,0x0)/Sata(0x0,0xFFFF,0x0): Not Found<br>&gt;&gt;Start PXE over IPv4.</p>

<p>This article will describe what happened, and show you how to fix this and similar issues. I'll assume that you've started the virtual machine using the bhyve command and are familiar with its various options (see <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bhyve&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html"><code>man 8 bhyve</code></a>).</p>

<p>In the message above, the UEFI firmware could not find an EFI bootloader, so it is attempting to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">network boot</a>. To skip this and simplify debugging, restart the bhyve virtual machine without a network adapter. You'll be greeted by the UEFI shell:</p>

<a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/bhyve-efi-shell.png" alt="bhyve UEFI shell: UEFI Interactive Shell EDK II mapping table"></a>

<p>Our goal is to find the EFI bootloader file that the firmware could not locate.</p>

<p>Helpfully, the EFI shell lists all of the storage devices and partitions that it could find. There will usually be at least two partitions on the Linux virtual machine's hard drive: the first, a small partition holding EFI firmware, the second, the Linux system. In this case, the EFI partition is <code>FS0</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(1,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the first GPT partition of the first drive) the main Linux partition is <code>BLK2</code> (listed as "<code>HD1(2,GPT,</code>…" i.e. the second GPT partition of the first drive). <code>BLK0</code> is the drive itself (not considering the partition table) and <code>BLK3</code> here is the swap partition.</p>

<p>We can navigate into a filesystem by typing its name, followed by a colon. From there, familiar commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code> will be available. Let's see what was installed to the EFI partition:</p>
<p>
<span>Shell&gt;</span><span>FS0:</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;EFI<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
<span>FS0:\&gt;</span><span>cd EFI</span><br>
<span>FS0:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>ls</span><br>
<span>Directory of: </span><span>FS0:\EFI\</span><br>
<span>03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;..<br>
03/02/2021&nbsp;&nbsp;16:54 &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,096&nbsp;&nbsp;debian<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 bytes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Dir(s)</span><br>
</p>

<p>Aha! The UEFI firmware expects to find the bootloader in <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/f1567720b13a578ffa54716119f826df622babcd/MdePkg/Include/Uefi/UefiSpec.h#L2209"><code>EFI/boot</code></a>, not in <code>EFI/debian</code>. Typically, bootloader paths would be set as UEFI variables, but <code>bhyve</code> is unable to store these between reboots.</p>

<p>The easiest way to start the Linux guest from here is to execute the EFI bootloader inside the <code>debian</code> folder:</p>

<p>
<span>FS:\EFI\&gt;</span><span>cd debian</span><br>
<span>FS:\EFI\debian\&gt;</span><span>grubx64.efi</span><br>
</p>

<p>Boot should now continue normally.</p>

<p>How can you avoid having to manually run the bootloader from the EFI shell? Here are three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reinstall <code>grub</code> under the prefix that the UEFI firmware expects. From within the Linux guest, <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/grub2/blob/master/util/grub-install.c#L295">you can run</a> <code>grub-install --bootloader-id=boot</code> to install to <code>EFI/boot</code> instead of <code>EFI/debian</code>. You'll probably have to rename <code>grubx64.efi</code> to <code>bootx64.efi</code> as well (often, the EFI partition will be mounted by default at <code>/boot/EFI</code>).</li>
  <li>Don't use UEFI boot, rather, use <code>grub2-bhyve</code> to boot using MBR / legacy boot.</li>
  <li>Use software like <a href="https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve">vm-bhyve</a> to handle the details for you.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-11964"><!-- .entry-header --><div> <p><em>Estimated read time (minus contemplative pauses): <span><span></span> <span> 47</span> <span></span></span> min.</em></p><h2>Introduction: Zero Existence</h2><p>In a fun episode on one of my favorite podcasts, <em>Elucidations</em> (<a href="https://elucidations.now.sh/posts/episode-42-agustin-rayo-discusses-the-construction-of-logical-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 42, 12/12/12</a>), philosopher Agustín Rayo argues that the number zero exists independently of human thought and behavior.</p><p>I like his argument. And it’s simple enough, I think, to get the gist of it across in a blog post.</p><p>To do that, I’ll draw from his 2014 paper, “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/96869">Nominalism, Trivialism, Logicism</a>” (the argument also appears, with more detail, in his 2013 book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ag3F8O">The Construction of Logical Space</a></em>, which I haven’t read). I found the paper to be playful and challenging. His writing is clear and his enthusiasm for these difficult topics is contagious; no surprise after hearing him on <em>Elucidations</em>.</p><p>This is not to say that I’ve been converted by Rayo’s argument, which can be extended to account for all natural numbers. I remain a <em>mathematical nominalist</em>—that is, someone who does not believe in the independent existence of numbers (or any other mathematical objects). This is in contrast to a&nbsp;<em>platonist</em>, who does believe in the independent existence of numbers (and perhaps other mathematical objects).</p><p>Actually, Rayo’s argument suggests what he calls a “subtle” platonism. But before getting into that, I’d like to say a little more about the nominalist–platonist divide—or, more precisely, about where I stand with respect to it.</p><p>It’s common, by the way, to see the word “Platonism” capitalized. I follow the standard of not capitalizing in this context, as contemporary mathematical platonism is usually significantly removed from Plato’s theory of eternal forms—e.g., Plato’s forms have causal powers, while the mathematical platonist’s abstract objects usually don’t.</p><p>That said, people use the terms in these discussions in sometimes very different ways. I’ll do my best to navigate the discursive terrain without becoming misled, bogged down, or lost in its many rabbit holes (though I’ll links some nice entryways into those rabbit holes).</p><h2>Nominalism versus Platonism about Mathematics (Or: Why I’m not a Platonist)</h2><p>In his paper, Rayo describes a common challenge posed to mathematical nominalists:</p><blockquote><p>Mathematical Nominalism is the view that there are no mathematical objets. A standard problem for nominalists is that it is not obvious that they can explain what the point of a mathematical assertion would be. For it is natural to think that mathematical sentences like ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ or ‘1 + 1 = 2’ can only be true if mathematical objects exist. But if this is right, the nominalist is committed to the view that such sentences are untrue. And if the sentences are untrue, it not immediately obvious why they would be worth asserting.</p><p>A nominalist could try to address the problem by suggesting nominalistic <em>paraphrases</em> for mathematical sentences. She might claim, for example, that when one asserts ‘the number of the dinosaurs is zero’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that there are no dinosaurs, and that when one asserts ‘1 + 1 = 2’ one is best understood as making the (nominalistically kosher) claim that any individual and any other individual will, taken together, make two individuals.<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>More carefully: ∀x∀y(x≠ y → ∃!<sub>2</sub>z(z = x ∨ z = y)).</p></blockquote><p>[The symbolic notation can be read quasi-formally as “for all <em>x</em> and for all <em>y</em>, if <em>x</em> doesn’t equal <em>y</em>, then there exist exactly two <em>z</em>‘s such that <em>z</em> equals <em>x</em> or <em>z</em> equals <em>y.</em>“]</p><p>The paraphrasing solution is roughly what I’m committed to as a nominalist. Actually, “committed” is too strong. It’s simpler than it. It just seems obvious to me that some form of nominalism is true, and that some aspect of that will involve paraphrasing.</p><p>That is, it’s easiest for me to accept an origin of numbers that involves something like “put as many apples in my bag as I have children” becoming shortened to, say, “put two apples in my bag.” And from there “two apples” becomes “two whatever” and then “two” becomes reified into a concept in its own right that can be invoked or signified or referred to explicitly with symbols such as the numeral “2” and expressions like “a quarter of eight” and “1/4 times 8” and “the square root of four” and “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B4%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{4} " title="\sqrt{4} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">” and “4<sup>1/2</sup>” and “the lowest prime number” and “the only even prime number” and “the lowest even non-negative integer” and “4 minus 2” and “5 minus 3” and so on forever.</p><p>There are infinitely many ways to represent the quantity two.</p><p>It’s plausible to me that, from something more or less along those lines, we developed over many centuries the beautiful system(s) of pure and applied mathematics we continue to develop today. So we now have the square root of two and of other prime numbers, negative numbers, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{-1} " title="\sqrt{-1} " srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7">, different sizes of infinity, as many dimensions as you want, arguments about Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, and wherein we are more or less able to satisfy a key desideratum of consistency within particular domains.</p><p>What do I mean by “particular domains”? Calculus students will lose points for not treating 0<sup>0</sup> as an indeterminate form (just like 0/0), even though mathematicians maintain that the answer is 1, “because mathematicians said so” (as it’s put in <a href="https://www.askamathematician.com/2010/12/q-what-does-00-zero-raised-to-the-zeroth-power-equal-why-do-mathematicians-and-high-school-teachers-disagree/">this <em>Ask a Mathematician/Ask a Physicist</em> post</a>; does this constitute a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formalism-mathematics/#ForPos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnapian formalist move</a>?). Depending on which calculator you input 0<sup>0</sup> into, you’ll get different answers. I put it into Google calculator and Desmos and got 1; Wolfram|Alpha yields “undefined” and lists it as an <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Indeterminate.html">indeterminate form</a>.</p><p>In that same calculus course, students must treat 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + … onto infinity as getting bigger and bigger without converging to a specific value. Common sense and mathematicians agree with this. But a physicist might tell you the sum of those numbers—or, at least, the proper value to put on the right side of the equal sign—is −1/12.</p><p>To see physicist Tony Padilla excited about this result—while assuring us that, “I know this looks like a bit of mathematical hocus-pocus sort of thing, but actually in truth it’s not… we know it’s not… because these kind of sums appear in physics all the time”—see this 2014 video from the popular Numberphile YouTube channel:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-I6XTVZXww" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>The video garnered pushback, such as from another popular YouTube channel, Matheloger:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuIIjLr6vUA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>And I recall seeing comments from math teachers saying things like “math is hard enough to teach without you telling our students wrong things.”</p><p>Padilla wrote a defense of his answer that I highly recommend anyone (fake-) outraged by the Numperphile video read, in which he compellingly, and I’d say passionately, maintains that −1/12 “is the <em>only</em> sensible value one can attach to this divergent sum. Infinity is not a sensible value. In my opinion, as a physicist, infinity has no place in physical observables, and therefore no place in Nature”: “<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzap4/response.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do we get if we sum all the natural numbers?</a>”</p><p>Or for a sober, yet still aptly wide-eyed-at-the-weirdness-of-it-all, assessment of the situation, see Numperphile’s follow-up video called&nbsp; “Why −1/12 Is a Gold Nugget”:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Oazb7IWzbA" width="300" height="168.75" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p><p>It features mathematician Edward Frenkel, who points out that the −1/12 result—which goes at least as far back as Leonhard Euler (born in 1707) and has a place in pure mathematics—arises in applications from an effort to make the sum meaningful or useful (very useful, in fact) for certain contexts. In other words, with sufficient mathematical rigor and self-awareness, the manipulations that enable us to jettison infinity while leaving behind a “golden nugget” of −1/12 are legitimate.</p><p>And yet, says Frenkel:</p><blockquote><p>I think, actually, we don’t really fully understand what’s happening here… it certainly is not the result of summation of these numbers; it is something else, but what is it? … it is the best kept secret maybe in physics, in quantum physics, that most of the calculations that physicists do today are like this. … I would say, it’s not exactly the sum… it blows up, it is infinite… does it mean that in some sense, there is a context in which this infinite sum is mysteriously −1/12? I’m not sure.</p></blockquote><p>Returning to the present point, it seems obvious to me that these developments and results and fascinating discussions can occur whether or not numbers exist independently of human activities. I’m unconvinced that the story requires the additional fact that there exists an eternal and immaterial mathematical realm against which our mathematical statements must hold up in order to be true; in order, for example, for −1/12 to be, in some sense, true. Same goes for 1 + 1 = 2.</p><p>I believe one and one really can make two <em>without</em> the existence of a realm of independently existing, immaterial, inert abstract objects we call “numbers.”</p><p>This is a naive intuition, I admit. And I’m not prepared to spend the next five to 20 years trying (and almost certainly failing) to bear it out to the satisfaction of everyone interested in this problem (myself included). So instead I’ll commit to a weaker claim. Namely, that my naive intuition has yet to be swayed by any platonist account I’ve seen. This includes Rayo’s, which I’m almost ready to get back to.</p><p>First, I think I need to say a little more about what sort of objects platonists take numbers to be. <span>A standard view, as I’ve already noted, is that they are abstract, causally inert objects that do not exist in the material world.</span></p><p>This raises many problems that I will only barely touch on here. A great place to start a deeper dive into those problems, along with the core problems nominalists face, is in the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(<em>SEP</em>) entries “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/">Abstract Objects</a>” and “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/">Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics</a>.” In that order. (And I’m sure to link more sources as I go along here.)</p><p>I will say that, despite knowing that many brilliant mathematically inclined people believe in a platonic realm of mathematical objects, I have not been swayed. This includes when the above-mentioned Frenkel writes in <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y3HqfL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Love and Math</em></a> (2014), a book I adore, that he believes in a “Platonic world of mathematics” that “exists independently of physical …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pico"><p><em>Thank you for supporting The Generalist. This is a collaboration between The Generalist and </em><a href="https://latecheckout.substack.com/"><em>Late Checkout</em></a><em>. </em></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/6000d83070ff9e96671cf34d_Ellipse.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>“You ever stop to realize how fragile all this is?”&nbsp;<br></p><p>George Carlin wears a black long-sleeved t-shirt, hunched over a microphone. In the minimalism of his outfit and the starkness of his bald pate, he almost resembles a tech executive delivering a keynote. But he’s too rumpled for that, too delightfully sour, as if a satyr stumbled through Steve Jobs’ wardrobe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It wouldn’t take much to throw us right back into barbaric times. All you’d have to do would be eliminate electricity.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Carlin continues, embarking on one of his trademark <em>quite-frightening-very-funny tirades</em>, the flashes of incandescent, articulate fury that made him a genius. No electricity means no lights, he explains. No batteries. No fuel. No water. No computers. It means jail doors springing open, crime flooding the streets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s a bleak, bitter joke and serves as a coherent expression of Carlin’s particular weltanschauung: life is a sleepwalk along a knife-edge. It also shades his view of electricity and what it represents. When harnessed, it’s a mollifying, enlightening force; the thin membrane between civilization and barbarism.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If Carlin is all rapid-fire verbosity in his 2005 set, he’s an expert of restraint in a complementary line:&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Electricity is just organized lightning.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are a hundred ways someone might describe a company like Reddit, but this is what we think of most. In its particular energy and vibrancy, its wild potential and ugly foibles, its kindness and cruelty, the social media platform occupies the liminal space of Carlin’s electricity. Just as it is close to some of our unseemliest instincts, so too is it a vehicle for creativity and connection. In short, Reddit is organized lightning. As the conductor of cultural currents, it may have more upside than any other social media company.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>In this piece, we’ll explore:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><ol role="list"><li>Reddit’s topsy-turvy history</li><li>Why it’s undervalued</li><li>Where the company is headed</li><li>The Galaxy Brain moves to take it to the next level<br></li></ol><h2>r/History</h2><p>Few companies have the narrative arc of Reddit. It’s a classic hero's tale with a call to adventure, challenges and setbacks, and a triumphant return.<br></p><h3><strong>The beginning</strong></h3><p>The same year that Carlin delivered his iconic set, University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian took a drive. They headed for Boston, where computer scientist, writer, and entrepreneur Paul Graham was scheduled to give a talk.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Huffman, a computer science student himself, was the motivating force, but he would have Ohanian to thank for brokering a meeting with Graham. As the story goes, at the end of the talk, Ohanian asked if Graham would come out to a drink with them. Over a few beers, Graham encouraged the pair to apply to his new incubator in Cambridge: Y Combinator.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Like so many others, Ohanian and Huffman didn’t get in with their first idea. The pair pitched “My Mobile Menu,” a way to order food via text. While Graham didn’t like that MMM, he invited them to come back to Boston for a brainstorm. By the end of an hour, they’d hit on a new mission: build the “front page of the internet.” Reddit was born.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It didn’t take long for the founding duo to ship v1. Written in Graham’s beloved Lisp, the site served as a fairly straightforward link aggregator that allowed for upvoting and downvoting. The first 100 accounts on the site were created by either Ohanian or Huffman to give the appearance of activity. A snapshot from the site from that period (thank you WayBackMachine) illustrates just how much of the culture was baked in early on, featuring conspiracy theories, wonkish dev chat, strong opinions, and “spez,” Huffman’s username.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327dd2cf48e5169301c0da_4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>‍<br><strong>Growing pains and the acquisition</strong></h3><p>Soon enough, Reddit added a third member. Aaron Schwartz, a coding prodigy also in YC’s cohort, merged his project, Infogami, with the company and hopped aboard. As Schwartz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001237/https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">later told it</a>, his reprogramming of the site from Lisp to Python coincided with a meaningful uptick in traffic:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>When I first started at Reddit, growth was slow. The site was put online very early — within weeks of starting work on it — but for the first three months it hardly got above three thousand visitors a day, which is about baseline for a useful RSS feed. Then, in a couple weeks of marathon coding sessions, we moved the site from Lisp to Python and I wrote an article about it for my blog. It got a lot of attention — Hell hath no fury like a Lisp fan scorned — and even today I still run into people at parties who, when I mention that I worked at Reddit, say "Oh, the site that switched from Lisp."<p>Around that time traffic really started taking off. In the next three months, our traffic doubled twice.</p></blockquote><p>Reddit was off to the races, though it wouldn’t follow the parabolic growth trajectory of other social media companies. Instead, the site grew rapidly but relatively steadily. Still, even after the company reached millions of visitors a month, generating revenue remained a challenge. Again, from Schwartz:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>We still had no idea how to make money. We sold t-shirts on the site, but every time we made a little bit of money on those we spent it on ordering more t-shirts. We signed up with a major Web ad representative to sell ads on our site, but they never seemed to be able to sell any ads for us and we rarely made more than, literally, a couple of dollars a month. Another idea we had was licensing the "Reddit technology" to let other people build sites that worked like Reddit. But we couldn't find anyone who wanted to license it from us.<br></blockquote><p>That context explains why Reddit was tempted to sell just a year after founding, giving up ownership to Condé Nast for a reported $10 - $20 million. (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/alexis-ohanian-reflects-on-selling-reddit-for-10-million.html">The deal closed on Halloween</a>). Over the following years, that initial trio drifted away from the company: Huffman to found Hipmunk, Ohanian to a Kiva Fellowship, and Schwartz to pursue web activism. (As you may know, Schwartz would go on to commit suicide in 2013.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Reddit continued to grow under corporate ownership, though it's hard not to feel a shadow hanging over that trajectory. What might have been had the company capitalized instead of selling? How might Huffman, Ohanian, and Schwartz have stewarded Reddit and developed the product with the right support?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The comeback</strong></h3><p>Perhaps recognizing it was not the best guardian of a social media business, Condé Nast spun Reddit out in 2011, with parent company Advance Networks serving as a passive shareholder. Yishan Wong joined as CEO the following year, leaving in 2014 after the company refused to move its HQ closer to his home in Daly City. He was replaced by Ellen Pao on an interim basis with Ohanian returning as executive chairman. When Pao was ousted in 2015, driven out of her role by a user base incensed over the firing of a popular Reddit employee, Huffman stepped back into the CEO seat. The band was back together.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s hard to overstate just how central Reddit was to pop-culture over the decade that saw Ohanian and Huffman found the business, sell it, and return once more. In both good and bad moments, the valorous and vile, Reddit was there. It served as the de facto town square for events like “The Fappening,” the Sony Pictures hack, the Boston Bombing, GamerGate, and Pizzagate.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since retaking the reins, Huffman has shown a desire to grow Reddit’s product and stamp out the site’s most toxic elements. The mobile experience was improved. The site was redesigned. Video was introduced. And, thousands of hate-filled subreddits were expunged.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Concerns that a more hands-on approach to moderation would curb the anarchic good-times vibe of the platform have been emphatically repudiated this year, with Reddit the ground-zero for the epic GameStop short squeeze.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Despite being one of the internet’s most popular websites, sixteen years after it was founded, Reddit feels like it's just getting started.</p><h2>r/Value</h2><p>Reddit is one of the most misunderstood and undervalued companies in the world.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A little over a week ago, Huffman announced the company had raised $250 million in new capital at a valuation of $6 billion. The round was led by Dubai-based firm Vy Capital, with follow-ons from a16z, Sequoia, and Tencent.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To which we have to say: <em>$6 billion? That’s it?&nbsp;</em>‍</p><p>In a world in which Clubhouse is worth $1 billion after a year of (impressive) traction, and Dispo is pegged at $100 million for an app still in beta, Reddit — cultural petri-dish, bastion of expression, distributed hedge-fund, meme-maker, group-therapist — is only worth $6 billion?<br></p><h3><strong>A thought experiment</strong></h3><p>Humor us. You’re given the chance to look at two social media companies. Your job is to pick the one that you think has the highest valuation. Here are a couple details.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Company 1</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 353 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 7%<br></li></ul><p><strong>Company 2&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>MAUs: 430 million</li><li>MAU growth YoY: 30%&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Now, you’re right to be a bit grumpy with us. You don’t have much to go on, right? No revenue, no costs, no churn. How are you supposed to figure out which is most valuable without that information? But if any space is defined by user growth, above anything else, it’s social media.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So which do you choose?</p><p>Company 1 is Twitter, worth $58 billion. Company 2, with more MAUs and 4x the growth, is Reddit. From a growth an engagement perspective, Reddit compares favorably to many of social media's public behemoths with close to the same number of MAUs as Pinterest. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/603282383bcd2639d35b1abe_CleanShot%202021-02-21%20at%2010.53.45%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Yet, the implied value of a Reddit user is criminally low:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f73bbd13fa8b95aedaf300b/60327d9d1e2df115f85a3d21_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br>Public and private market investors effectively value a Facebook DAU at 3.5x the price of a Reddit one, and a Facebook MAU at 19x of the Reddit equivalent.<br></p><h3><strong>Explanations and misconceptions</strong></h3><p>What is the rationale behind this aggressive discounting? We think it stems from outdated historical data and an anachronous view of the product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Sure, historically, Reddit has done a poor job of bringing in revenue on a per-user basis. In 2019, Reddit was said to have an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $0.30, much less than Facebook at …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we have a moment that many of our readers will be waiting for. The AMD Threadripper Pro is now available at retail with additional platform vendors entering the space. As such, we wanted to quickly mark the occasion, and also offer an update to our earlier ASUS coverage.<span id="more-51172"></span></p>
<h2>AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro Lenovo Exclusivity Ends</h2>
<p>The AMD Threadripper Pro platform was announced in the summer of 2020. We covered this in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-is-a-workstation-epyc-or-wepyc/">AMD Threadripper Pro is a Workstation EPYC or WEPYC</a> piece. At the time, the platform was exclusively sold by Lenovo and we know many of our readers purchased these systems at work.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX Review the &quot;WEPYC&quot;" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVLDlrz09Os?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Recently, we published our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/lenovo-thinkstation-p620-review-first-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/">Lenovo ThinkStation P620 Review</a> using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-3995wx-review-a-bold-wepyc/">AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3995WX</a>. It is a great platform, however, it is very focused on selling to organizations that have an existing Lenovo relationship. For those who do not have existing Lenovo relationships and access to corporate discounts, the P620 pricing was on the higher end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In our earlier coverage, we noted how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-amd-ryzen-threadripper-pro-launch/">Supermicro</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/gigabyte-wrx80-su8-ipmi-amd-threadripper-pro-motherboard/">Gigabyte</a>, and <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/asus-pro-ws-wrx80e-sage-se-wifi-amd-threadripper-pro/">ASUS</a> are releasing platforms to help proliferate Threadripper Pro. As part of the retail availability launch today, we have a few ASUS updates.</p>

<p>The first big update is that we have the ASUS Pro WS WRX80E-SAGE SE WIFI in the lab. Expect a review in the coming weeks of this platform. What we can say, with complete certainty is that ASUS is offering a highly differentiated solution compared to what Lenovo has been shipping.</p>

<p>An example of one of the features we did not cover in our motherboard launch piece, but we have found during testing is that the system comes with a Hyper M.2 x16 Gen4 card. This allows four M.2 SSDs to be added to the system via a PCIe x16 slot. Combined with three onboard M.2 slots, that means one can put seven M.2 SSDs on this platform.</p>

<p>Expect the full review soon. Still, one of the challenges with reviewing a motherboard in this space is that many of the buyers are going to be corporations that have little interest in building their own workstations. Selling a motherboard meets the needs of some in the market, but others want to purchase complete systems. ASUS is partnering with Velocity Micro to offer a workstation based on the new chips and the ASUS motherboard. This is the Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150:</p>
<figure id="attachment_51175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51175"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-threadripper-pro-hits-retail-asus-update/velocity-micro-promagix-hd150-wrx80-tr-pro-system/" rel="attachment wp-att-51175"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg" alt="Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System" width="800" height="544" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-400x272.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-696x473.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Velocity-Micro-ProMagix-HD150-WRX80-TR-Pro-System-618x420.jpg 618w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-51175">Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 WRX80 TR Pro System</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Velocity Micro ProMagix HD150 uses a closed-loop liquid cooling solution instead of Lenovo’s air cooler. This can be important when one uses higher TDP CPUs such as the Threadripper Pro 3995WX.</p>
<p>This is an important development for our readers who need to purchase complete systems instead of motherboards at work. ASUS has a great motherboard, but selling it as a complete system makes it more accessible in this market. One of the other nice features is that the ProMagix HD150 starts at under $4,500 which is a lot lower than Lenovo has been selling the P620 for while it had little to no competition.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, we know this is a day many of our readers have been waiting for since the original announcement in July 2020. It is now possible to purchase non-Lenovo AMD Threadripper Pro CPUs, motherboards, and systems opening up the use cases for these systems.</p>

We have drones too.</figcaption></figure><p id="f23b">Columbus has been home to a large group of insurance businesses for decades. Just take a look across the Downtown Columbus skyline. There are at least five established insurance companies (annual revenues well over $500M each) who have their headquarters within a few miles of each other, including Nationwide, where I’m an investor as part of the venture capital team.</p><p id="7702">Columbus’ central business district is dotted with insurance companies. They’ve made a huge impact — not only on the city and its physical footprint but also the broader insurance industry. Though there is a focus on the auto sector with Ohio’s legacy in the automobile industry, today these are big and robust businesses ranging across property &amp; casualty as well as life and other lines of business.</p><p id="7e67">However, there is now an exciting new cohort of insurance businesses being built in Columbus. Called “insurtechs,” these companies operate in a wide variance of coverage types and sectors. But the one thing that ties them together is a digital-first or technology-infused approach to the insurance industry, which is a trend playing out both in Columbus and globally. In my role on Nationwide’s venture capital team, I’m fortunate to have a front-row seat to the action — both here and abroad.</p><p id="c663">There are multiple meaningfully venture-backed businesses in Columbus that are growing fast with disruptive business models, including Root (just filed their S-1!), Beam Dental, Matic (of which Nationwide is an investor), and Branch.</p><p id="b7db">These industry hubs may appear to happen by accident, but when we look deeper, there is often a common ingredient — talent. Industry clusters offer job opportunities and job mobility, making the sell for Columbus a little bit easier — especially when recruiting specialized out-of-town talent. The density of colleges and universities, especially a major one like Ohio State University, makes it easier to find early career talent when growing a team. It’s also unique that Columbus has technology investors like Nationwide and Drive Capital that are focusing on finding Insurtech startups as an investment theme. (<em>Note: Drive invested in both Root and Beam.)</em></p><p id="8b89">Nationwide competes with some of the companies above and partners with others. In any case, the density of talent from both entry-level who grow into roles and the executive talent brought in from other places has a net positive impact for Columbus. Regardless of COVID-19’s impact to remote or in-person working, I’m optimistic the Columbus Insurtech buzz is here to stay.</p><p id="c0f2">The momentum is clear. Columbus is not only one of the most active cities in the United States for insurance in general, but it’s also an emerging Insurtech hub. I’m excited to contribute with capacity on the venture capital side (take our dedicated <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/cps/nw-ventures.html" rel="noopener">$100 million venture capital fund at Nationwide</a> for example), but the real energy is with some of the most compelling businesses in the entire insurance technology sector being located right here in Columbus. While some of these companies are just getting started, it’s clear to see that the competitive advantage of being located so close to legacy insurance carriers is bringing the capabilities needed to build the next generation of great insurance businesses right here in Ohio’s capital.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Build with us!</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Companies Prepare for Waves of Data Breach Lawsuits]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<p>Data breaches are inevitable. And no amount of security protocols can provide absolute assurance that consumer information is protected. With increasing threats of identity theft, who should be responsible for the majority of data breach risk, the consumer or the business? California lawmakers argue that the majority of that burden on the business owner.</p>



<p>They incentivized stricter security measures by broadening the requirements needed to file a lawsuit in the case of a data breach. By lowering this bar, they have essentially shifted more liability to businesses. Prop 24’s amendments go into effect January 1st 2023, but has a look back period starting on January 1st 2022. Whether businesses should or should not bear the majority of risk, they will need to examine the parameters of these changes closely and update their data security to the most recent standards in order to prevent these lawsuits.</p>







<h2>Prop 24’s Changes in the CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)</h2>



<p>The CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) is an addendum to the historic <a href="https://toslawyer.com/what-are-the-requirements-for-ccpa-compliance/">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> . It is a series of amendments that:</p>



<ol><li>Allow consumers to limit access to sensitive data</li><li>Stop businesses from keeping data beyond its use</li><li>Triple the fine for violating children’s privacy rights</li><li>Create a new agency with enforcement power</li></ol>



<p>And Lastly,</p>



<p><strong>Expand the definition of sensitive data to include email and password information in the list of items covered during a negligent data breach.</strong></p>



<p>Since it is difficult for consumers to track identity theft to a specific data breach, this particular amendment expands the CCPA right of action to consumers that can’t prove a financial loss. </p>



<p>This particular change has two profound implications. First, it makes it much harder to agree on damages if there is no financial loss. As a result, violations range between $100-$750 per record. Secondly, this incentivizes bad actors to exploit the system for profit. </p>



<p>Since many companies will not be able to keep up with increasing standards for security measures, they will need to update their SAAS agreement <a href="http://toslawyer.com/negotiating-a-saas-agreement-what-you-should-know/">indemnification clauses</a> to account for this type of dispute.</p>



<h2><strong>Consumer Actions under the CCPA and the CPRA</strong></h2>



<p>Consumer actions hinge on a company’s failure to protect their personal information from a breach. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_24,_Consumer_Personal_Information_Law_and_Agency_Initiative_(2020)">CPRA (Prop 24) broadens what is considered personal information</a>.</p>



<p>The most critical amendments to the CCPA are just two or three letters. The CCPA previously required that information be either nonencrypted or nonredacted to qualify under the Act. Lawmakers used the word “or ” instead of “and ” when adding email and password to the list. This has significant implications on what qualifies the data and how companies failed to protect the breach.</p>



<p>If one were to read the qualification before the amendment, the only data that would qualify would be anything that could reveal someone’s identity or any personal data lacking encryption. Now email and password information neither need to be encrypted nor reveal someone’s identity to qualify. This amendment means that anonymous throwaway emails are included. This critical two-letter word significantly broadens the scope of liability in data breach lawsuits.</p>



<p>The second change to the law slightly limits the scope of liability by changing the “or” between “nonencrypted OR nonredacted” to “nonencrypted AND nonredacted.” This change means any data other than email and password needs to lack encryption and reveal personal data’s identity to qualify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the data in a breach meets the two combined conditions or any personal information includes someone’s email and password, a breach would need to be the result of a company not implementing and maintaining reasonable security procedures and practices. While previous administrations have interpreted “reasonable” in one matter, there’s no guarantee that will hold in the future.</p>



<h2><strong>What Constitutes Reasonable Security Procedures and Practices against data breaches?</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="data breach" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/markus-spiske-uPXs5Vx5bIg-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<p>The AG established the baseline by using <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/">20 data security controls published by the Center for Internet Security</a>. Any agreement with a SaaS company should warrant compliance with these control as a minimum standard.</p>



<p>While these guidelines may not protect you, or your vendors, in the future, failing to meet&nbsp;the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/dbr/2016-data-breach-report.pdf">reasonable standards enumerated by the state’s AG in 2014 and 2016</a> would likely hurt any defense you might make in case of a violation.</p>



<h2><strong>Managing Privacy Standards In SAAS Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>Security is often a point of negotiation when striking a SAAS agreement with third party vendors. Businesses don’t want to accept the risk if a vendor’s security isn’t up to par. Yet, most SaaS agreements don’t go far enough to protect the business. For example, companies can neglect to include who is responsible for notifying customers of a breach. Identifying each party’s data security obligations is critical to establish who will be accountable in the case of a lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When there is a breach of consumer data, the effects can last for years. According to UISM and the Ponemon Institute’s research, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach">the average cost of a data breach in 2020 is $3.86 million</a>. This cost includes the time and direct costs from dealing with a breach, regulatory fines, potential lost opportunity costs from customer churn and negative publicity, and a data breach lawsuit.</p>



<h2><strong>Expect More Legal Challenges and Data Breach Lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of the steps that businesses take to protect themselves from security breaches, lawsuits, and regulatory fines, Prop 24 vastly increases the likelihood that additional data breach lawsuits will occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 50 lawsuits had already been filed by July – just six months into the CCPA – covering data breaches, noncompliance with the CCPA, and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL). Because of the potential monetary awards, most of these actions come in the form of class-action lawsuits.</p>



<p>The increase in class action suits came due to the CCPA’s requirement that offers statutory damages rather than providing actual damages. CPRA, or Prop 24, could increase the number of class action lawsuits.</p>



<h2><strong>Increasing security isn’t enough</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg" alt="strategy" width="920" height="616" srcset="https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x.jpg 920w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-300x201.jpg 300w, https://toslawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/scott-graham-5fNmWej4tAA-unsplash@025x-768x514.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"></figure></div>



<p>Since encryption may not be enough to protect this information from a breach, companies need to update indemnification clauses for these types of scenarios. The new amendments provide a wide range from <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ccpa-qotd-what-are-the-penalties-for-91822/">$100 to $7,500 per record</a> in applicable damages. Establishing an agreed-upon damage amount in the indemnification clause will help protect against costly class-action suits. A full understanding of the rapidly evolving security standards and legal precedence is critical to making these updates to your SAAS agreements.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>So sometimes i visit <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">yc hackernews</a>. Maybe just because they still have this anachronistic css which nowadays looks like the script blocker has interfered. There is this <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API link</a> at the bottom and the first thing i tried was the <code>Max Item ID</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json"</span><span>).</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This is actually large enough to be a little challenging. So i <a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/tree/master/src/hackernews">downloaded them all</a> using 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> and <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">aiohttp</a> with a rate of about 100 messages per second and exported them into <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html">elasticsearch</a>. The whole process took about 3 days.</p>

<p>They started in late 2006 and most of the stuff that we have become completely used to was not even existing then.</p>

<h3 id="protocol">protocol</h3>



<p><strong>96.6%</strong> of all posted urls are HTTP<strong>S</strong> nowadays. And currently about 30,000 URLs are posted each month as can be seen in the next figure.</p>

<p>It’s just interesting how <em>smooth</em> the above graph is. HTTPS was specified in 2000, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s encrypt</a> started in 2016, 
Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html">deprecated</a> HTTP in 2018 and a lot more milestones will have happened in between but the figure shows none of it. Only a continuous steady climb.</p>



<p>One can still find a thousand HTTP links per month ;-)</p>

<p>Here is a top ten of Jan/Feb 2021:</p>

<div><div><pre><code> 37x diego-pacheco.blogspot.com
 30x m.nautil.us
 17x bit.ly
 12x www.bbc.com
 11x nautil.us
 11x web.archive.org
 11x www.paulgraham.com
 10x eepurl.com
 10x www.tr0lly.com
  9x blogs.quovantis.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are actually people posting stuff like <code>http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20210103-englands-sleepy-scientology-town</code>. Is this by purpose or have they disabled the automatic redirect to https and don’t know it? At least in the case of the bbc page, there actually is no redirect when visiting the link (March 2021).. Maybe if one posts a lot of links like this and then hangs around at public wifi spots, hoping someone clicks the links and visits a logged-in payed site via HTTP..</p>

<p>What are actually the first HTTPS pages posted on hackernews?</p>

<p>Hackernews is a marketing target (Well, just my guess, if you disagree please 
<a href="https://github.com/defgsus/blog/issues/new">create an issue</a> so we can try to proof/disproof numerically) and the following figure shows the percentage of URLs containing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters">UTM tracking parameters</a>. It basically means someone is using google analytics to count the number of visitors that come on her page by following a specific link, like a post on hackernews.</p>

<p>The popular query parameters <code>p</code> and <code>id</code> are included for comparison. They are generally not used for campaign tracking. (Again, you can click the variables on the right to view/hide them to get a better overview.)</p>



<p>Regarding the marketing allegation above, i must admit that it’s <em>only</em> 12 tracking code URLs per day on average. But why is it limited in time like this?</p>

<p>We can split by the query <strong>values</strong> of the UTM parameters. Below are roughly all major UTM trackers. Note that, e.g. <code>hackernews</code> most of the time means: Someone not affiliated with hackernews posted a link there, putting something like <code>?utm_source=hackernews</code> in the URL to count how many people click the posted link.</p>

<p>(What this also implies is that google attaches hackernews to their profile of you, but hey, it’s free!)</p>



<p>So increasingly different actors are posting their tracking stuff but in March 2018 they all stop? Is it that hackernews does remove them automatically in most cases?</p>

<p>Let’s compare this with the URLs posted in comments. The percentage of utm tracking links versus utm-free links in the post’s text are plotted below. It’s not much really, a 10th of the url-field numbers. And it’s completely undisturbed by the March 2018 cut-off.</p>



<p>(These numbers are not as accurate as the url-field numbers above. The utm-urls are filtered with this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html">lucene-style query</a> <code>text: href AND utm AND (source OR campaign)</code> on a text field tokenized by the default <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stop-analyzer.html">stop analyzer</a>. So there might be a few false positives in there.)</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26316715">A stupid post</a>, but genuinely out of a hacker’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">curiosity</a>, confirms the suspicion that Hackernews is actually removing those parameters now.</p>

<p>And how come these</p>



<p>utm-tagged URLs since April 2018? Are they privileged people? Or have they just another parameter in front as tested <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26319485">in this post</a>?</p>

<p>Well, most of them have, but not these ones:</p>

On September 2019 <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/09/candidate-sites-for-spacex-starship.html" target="_blank" title="Candidate sites for SpaceX Starship Mars landings revealed"><b>it was revealed</b></a> SpaceX has selected several <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/p/starship.html" target="_blank" title="Summary about the SpaceX's Starship Super Heavy in development"><b>Starship</b></a> candidate landing sites on Mars. The candidate sites were located in Southern Arcadia Planitia East of Erebus Montes and one in Phlegra Montes.</p><p>

Since then <b>SpaceX has conducted several workshops with the Mars science community to evaluate and narrow the list of candidate landing sites</b>. All the sites must fit several criteria:
  
</p><ol>
  <li>close to significant <a href="https://www.humanmars.net/2019/04/map-of-shallow-subsurface-water.html" target="_blank" title="Map of shallow subsurface water distribution on Mars">deposits of water/ice</a>, a required resource for in situ propellant production and a consumable to support habitation;</li>
  <li>elevation below -2 km (with respect to the MOLA geoid) that can support the delivery of large payloads, with -3 km preferred;</li>
  <li>latitude must be &lt;40° for solar power and thermal management, and closer to the equator is desirable;</li>
  <li>multiple separate landing locations spaced within a few km of each other, to support the multiple missions needed to grow an outpost;</li>
  <li>slopes should be &lt;5° over a 10 m length scale and the chance of impacting a rock greater than 0.5 m high (1 m diameter) should be &lt;5%;</li>
  <li>landing site must be radar reflective to enable measurement of the distance to the surface, and it must be load bearing to support the spacecraft at touchdown.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Recently an abstract with the <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2021/pdf/2420.pdf" target="_blank" title="'SpaceX Starship landing sites on Mars' by M.Golombek et al"><b>conclusions</b></a> has been published (the results of the study will be presented in two weeks, at the <i>52nd Lunar and Planetary Science Conference</i>), pointing out <b><span>4 prime</span> and <span>3 secondary</span> potential Starship landing sites selected for further study and located in Phlegra Montes, Erebus Montes and Southern Arcadia Planitia</b>:</p><div>
  
<ul>
  <li><span>PM-1</span> has the lowest latitude and elevation of the Phlegra Montes sites, a clear association with LDAs (local ice deposits expressed as lobate debris aprons), well developed polygons (one of the indicators of ice-related morphologies), and has the highest SWIM (Subsurface Water Ice Mapping) score for geomorphic indicators of ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-1</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has a moderate combined SWIM score for ice;</li>
  <li><span>AP-9</span> has the thickest ice from radar returns (of the Arcadia Planitia sites) and geomorphology indicating shallow ice. It has the highest combined SWIM score for ice, but appears slightly rocky and rough;</li>
  <li><span>EM-16</span> has a clear association with an LDA with nearby brain terrain and the strongest radar return for shallow ice and the highest combined SWIM score of the Erebus Montes sites;</li>
  <li><span>AP-8</span> (Arcadia Planitia) appears to be one of the safest sites and has the highest neutron and combined SWIM scores for ice;</li>
  <li><span>EM-15</span> (Erebus Montes) is associated with a prominent but less extensive LDA, has well developed polygons, nearby brain terrain and appears smooth;</li>
  <li><span>PM-7</span> is adjacent to lineated valley fill (attributed to glacial flow) and appears to be the safest of the Phlegra sites.</li>
  </ul>

The derailment of Ant Group Co.â€™s $35 billion share sale and mounting scrutiny of its operations have since upended one of Chinaâ€™s biggest business success stories. The authorities have also cracked down on technology juggernauts in everything from e-commerce to credit-scoring and payments.</p><p>The capital requirements are expected to hit Ant the most by crippling growth at its two microlending arms. Antâ€™s Jiebei and Huabei units had facilitated 1.7 trillion yuan ($263 billion) in consumer loans to 500 million people as of June 30, with only about 2% being kept on the parentâ€™s balance sheet. Concerns that it will need to raise capital to plug the shortfall and seek national licenses have prompted analysts at Morningstar Inc. to slash estimates on Antâ€™s valuation by half from $280 billion before its scrapped listing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Guo said China continues to support fintech innovation such as providing credit to small businesses, though they must do so according to law and regulations.</p><p>Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Was there a moment where things “clicked” that solidified your decision to stay on the IC track? If so, how do you reflect on this moment looking back?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>For a long time I wasn’t fully conscious about the decision. I was driven by passion and interest. But eventually, trying other career tracks like management, software engineering, etc. helped me realize I was happier as a designer, over time, than when in other roles.</p><p>It also helped meeting and talking with other people who had successfully stayed on an IC track or managed to find a way to keep building and creating, like Nicholas Felton, Guido Van Rossum, Jony Ive, Lee Byron, Koen Bok and many others. This really helped me feel comfortable and come to terms with my own draw toward making rather than coordinating.</p><p>Really, I think coordination vs creation is what it comes down to for me. They are two very different categories of concerns and you really have to feel connected to it in order to be willing to learn, evolve and enjoy your work.</p><p>As a designer my concerns are with planning, puzzling and learning. When I tried working in a software-engineering capacity, the concerns were similar, but with other materials and a very different way of learning.</p><p>With management it’s almost like a completely different universe where little to none of the skills of a designer are useful. It’s more about politics and juggling particular needs of individuals on your team. I admire people who are good at this and I really think it’s one of the hardest things you can do in life.</p><p>To me, choosing to be a designer means my concerns are focused around the following four categories:</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> What is the opportunity or issue that needs to change? What’s the history?</p><p><strong>Constraints:</strong> What do we know already? Where do we start exploring and unearthing more? This is a big part of design in my opinion: exploring constraints, learning and growing, then navigating constraints. Also, what materials do we work with and what are our options and trade-offs?</p><p><strong>People:</strong> Who are we doing this for, and what do they care about?</p><p><strong>Craft:</strong> less about a project, and more about a designer’s own ability to be effective, efficient and able to communicate their ideas.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What advice would you give to a senior designer who is trying to decide between the IC track and management track?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>Recognize that you’d be “going back to school” to learn a whole new skill-set. It’s a bit like a restaurant chef who starts a juice company — they are still in the food industry but their day-to-day is very different. What, and who, they spend time with has almost no overlap and the skills needed to be a great chef are likely quite different than what you need to successfully start and run a juice company.</p><p>Let me offer you something else by asking you a question:</p><p><strong>What type of person do you want to spend most of your time with?</strong></p><p>As a manager it will be coworkers, as a designer it will be the customers of whatever you are designing. Both are important aspects of the path to mastery, but it can be useful sometimes to try looking at something from a different perspective.</p><p>For me, the thought of spending hours a week, every week, for years speaking with customers of, for example, Figma or early Spotify, is exciting! It’s something that makes my brain tingle! You really have to introspect and listen to yourself to find your own answer to this question though.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What trade-offs or risks, if any, should designers know about before continuing down the IC path?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>It will likely always be a challenge to feel like you are learning and “progressing.” This will be totally fine as long as you’re willing to work on building mental tools and constructs to help yourself.</p><p>Tribes, friend circles, neighborhoods, countries, or professional organizations will have varying degrees of meaning attached to roles, titles and money. For example, in the USA a management title is important to many people because of history and culture; being the Foreman at a factory meant you were exceptionally skilled. This obviously doesn’t hold true in all cases, but understanding what political and social meaning your choice has will be important. Really, recognizing what group of people would make you feel most happy, most fulfilled.</p><p>As a career IC you will have to be <em>really</em> good at what you are doing in order to increase monetary compensation. If you are reading this, chances are you are already interested in, or already on, the path to mastery as a career IC designer. And that likely means you want to be the best you can be at your job. That’s great. Don’t worry about it too much though.</p><p>Speaking of compensation, depending on the company and region on Earth, management might or might not be considered a harder task and already command a higher level of monetary compensation than a designer. This varies quite a bit in my experience. Some companies, especially traditional or old ones, tend to give managers a higher salary than ICs simply by tradition and belief.</p><p>In some cultures, like in Japanese industry, there are even compensation models assuming that management is part of<!-- --> <em>anyone’s</em> career path (e.g. compensation as the sum area of a square where x is experience and y the number of people you manage).</p><p>If you are going to work or live in a place that is like this, it might be much harder to pursue an IC career.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>For designers committed to staying on the IC track beyond the senior level, what are the most important skills they should learn outside of the hard craft skills?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>The more experience you have, the more implicit authority you will have. It can be tough to understand that when you propose a silly idea over lunch when you have 5 years of experience has a very different impact than when you have 15 years of experience — someone might actually listen to you and go make it!</p><p>Really, this is a great thing, a sort of influential power you gain. It needs love, care and maintenance though — always work on getting better, learning from your mistakes and improving on your experience. There’s nothing more dangerous for an organization than a person with terrible ideas whom everyone admires professionally.</p><p>Powers you will have as an experienced IC:</p><p><strong>Experience with many things.</strong> What you are tackling today you might have experience with from the past. Use and share this experience in an informative way, not in a directing way! The past is different from the now, and the circumstances, people, and technology are definitely not the same. Avoid using your past experience as definitive facts or imposition as constraints.</p><p><strong>Sense of quality:</strong> You will likely have a better intuition for quality than professionally-younger designers.</p><p><strong>Intuition around cost.</strong> Design is not art, even though it can accidentally be seen as art later on. All design challenges have some form of budget: time, money, etc. With your experience, you’ve used your amazing human brain to form connections that gives you intuition...a form of premonition. You can sense that “this option will probably be much more costly than that option.”</p><p>This is great stuff and in some way what makes a good designer efficient: the ability to estimate and approximate the path to good decisions and solutions. Work on making use of this intuition, dare to “trust your gut.” Work on communicating these hunches to your coworkers in a way that is never condescending or dismissive but rather assistive.</p><p>For example, if you feel that the information density is too high, that there is too much information being displayed, you might start a conversation about how important approachability is to the thing you are building. In contrast, what you probably shouldn’t do, is to assert implicit authority — perhaps unconsciously — by saying “this won’t work, it’s way too dense.”</p><p>By leveling up to the subject or category of your intuition’s concern, you can help your coworkers see what you see: that the design may be a bit overwhelming. When people come to a concrete conclusion like that on their own, they are much better equipped to do a good job at addressing it. Sometimes it also turns out that your intuition is misdirected and a short conversation can help you realize that.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>What are the mile markers for you to know that you are still growing as a designer and progressing in your career?</p></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><div><p>I try to make things in ways which are new to me. When I do this, I have to spend time studying to learn, and that is really the focus of most of my hobby projects. When I come back to the thing I was making, and apply what I learned, I can feel that I made some progress. Sometimes this bears no fruit; sometimes it is not interesting or I fail to learn and that’s okay.</p><p>Another one: when professional people I look up to show their interest and support in my ideas. For example, I’ve dabbled in typography since the early 2000s but never been great at it until a few years ago when I decided to really focus on learning and getting good at making typefaces.</p><p>It took a year or so of pretty hard work before some designers in the typography industry reached out, recognized my progress, and in every single case helped me get even better and helped me see my own work in different ways. To me this really <em>feels</em> like improving and is important to me.</p><p>Finally, respect from leaders of organizations. When someone at a company with direct personal influence over its success or failure asks me for advice, I know that I’ve been able to build trust and do a good job as a designer. You, reader, probably agree with me that design as a tool and method is something fit for many problems, not just graphic problems or user interfaces. As a career IC designer, a goal of mine is to offer design (“design thinking” if you will) as a tool fit for many problems. When this is recognized and actually applied successfully, you’ve accomplished something that might only be possible as an advanced IC designer.</p></div></div><div><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>How important are titles for individual contributors when it comes to impact or decision making? Is there a meaningful difference …</p></div></div></div>

<strong>Team:</strong> <code>cat /dev/random | grep "to be or not to be"</code><br>
<strong>Who:</strong> Jan-Willem Buurlage, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Timon Knigge,  Abe Wits<br>
<strong>Score:</strong> 10282641<br>
<strong>Rank:</strong> 16</p>

<p>Since we did quite well, here is a write-up of our participation in Hashcode 2021.</p>

<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>

<p>All four of us had previously participated in Hashcode, but this was the first
time in the current composition.  Since we estimated our chances of getting
through to the finals to be more than nothing, we decided to practice some
previous Hashcode problems.  Not all test sessions were equally successful, but
we did manage to get a good division of work: while I start by immediately writing
the IO <code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code> classes, and the <code>Output::score()</code> function,
the others always start with reading the statement, analysing the testcases,
and writing at least one greedy solution. This already is a big step up
from previous years/teams, where usually everybody would write the IO
themselves.</p>

<p>Next to this, we also set up a template repository (to be open-sourced
eventually) containing stub <code>io.h</code> and
<code>main.cpp</code> files. This way, all we have to do is store, read, and write the
<code>Input</code> and <code>Output</code>, while the API is already fixed so that others can start
writing their parts without waiting for me to be done with the basics.</p>

<p>Another great help is a custom <code>run.py</code> script that compiles a solution and runs it on all
testcases, stores <em>all</em> solution files, and keeps track of maximum scores per
testcase so far. To ease online submission,  it symlinks these best scores to a
separate directory, where it also writes the zipped code.
After post contest optimizations, the output looks like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ run.py ragnar/greedy.cpp
                                            best    this run    old best       delta
Score for  a                        :       2002        2002        2002           0
Score for  b                        :    4568339     4564400     4568339       -3939
Score for  c                        :    1312204     1289135     1312204      -23069
Score for  d                        :    2493047     2335840     2493047     -157207
Score for  e                        :     718417      673445      718417      -44972
Score for  f                        :    1419782      415082     1419782    -1004700
========================================
Total score:                            10513791     9279904    10513791
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also have a small Python script to help with analysing the testcases,
containing some functions to quickly print a summary of a list of numbers so
it’s easy to quickly get a feeling for e.g. the range of in-degrees in this
problem.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>With an early break from work, a quick outside walk, plenty of coffee, food,
and snacks stashed, the git template copied, and some final jumping jacks done,
we were ready for the start!</p>

<p>This sections covers all the mistakes we made - the interesting stuff comes
after.</p>

<h3 id="first-hour">First hour</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:01] Timon Knigge: problem commit
&gt; [00:02] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: add input
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Help! The site didn’t load for most of us, so committing the pdf and input (as
we do anyway) turned out to be the faster option.
(Note: Times are relative to the contest start.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [00:11] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: input
&gt; [00:24] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: output
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>While the others started reading the long
<a href="https://hashcodejudge.withgoogle.com/#/rounds/5879728443490304/">statement</a>, I
wrote the reading of the input and writing of the output. (I won’t explain the
problem here, you probably already read it anyway.) Input was relatively
simple, but required a rewrite to directly map street names back to integers.
That probably took most of those 11 minutes:</p>

<details>
  <summary>Input data</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>// Note: code samples have been slightly cleaned by removing unrelated code and</span>
<span>// debug output, but is otherwise exactly as written during the contest.</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<p>Output took slightly longer, mostly because this requires both writing and reading, so we can improve existing solutions using local search.
One nice thing here is that the problem statement has a sample input and output,
so now we can do a sanity check and read and write the output, and check whether it remains the same.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Output data</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Green</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>ll</span> <span>street</span><span>,</span> <span>duration</span><span>;</span>

<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:14] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: scoring
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next up was adding the scoring function, which took considerable time.
This problem had relatively complicated simulation with lots of bookkeeping and
different ids, which made it slow to implement this correctly. I opted for a
simple yet slow approach as initial implementation:
For each time step, iterate over all streets and check
whether the traffic light is green using <code>std::map::lower_bound</code>. Each street
would have a queue of cars waiting there. This can be
improved in multiple ways, but I figured having an implementation fast was more
important than having a fast implementation.</p>

<p>In the end I got the right score on the sample output, and without submissions
to test the scoring function, I was happy and continued to write a simple
solution myself.</p>

<h3 id="everybody-gets-1">Everybody gets 1</h3>
<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:37] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: random solution
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The simplest idea I could come up with was the following:
for each intersection, give 1 second of green light to each incoming street.
We do not yet care about the order, so just order them as they
appear in the input.</p>

<p>Given all the work done before, coding this was very simple:</p>
<details>
  <summary>A simple idea</summary>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>**</span> <span>argv</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>init</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>);</span>

<p>I ran this on all the testcases and made our first submission to the judge
system for a total of 7,885,741 points. A decent score with a position somewhere
in the top 1000 IIRC, but nowhere close to top 100. We had spent a lot of time
on IO and scoring already so this is not too surprising for a very simple first
attempt.</p>

<p>This is the point where we learned the judge actually has some great
visualizations and info to help debugging. If only we’d known before!</p>

<p>Playing around a bit, I was able to increase the score on F by 300k by making a
light green for \(x\) seconds when a total of \(x\) cars entered via that street.
The intuition as for why this may be a good idea should be obvious.</p>

</code></pre></div>  </div>

</details>

<p>Fiddling a bit more, I was able to bump F another 500k as well by making it green for \(\sqrt x\) seconds.
At the time, this seemed sensible, \(\sqrt x\) being the geometric mean of \(1\) and
\(x\), but I didn’t really have a proper explanation.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, the introduction of the <code>if(usage[sid] == 0) continue</code>,
i.e. only giving green lights to streets that are used at all, in combination
with the original 1 second duration, bumped the score
for D another 600k.</p>

<p>At this point, we were in the 9.4M-9.6M range. Very respectable, but not yet in
the top.</p>

&gt; [01:59] Jan-Willem Buurlage: Update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Jan-Willem was working on a greedy solution, and Abe and Timon were
trying to analyse the testcases, but having a somewhat hard time because the
it seemed like the testcases did not contain much structure that could lead to simple greedy algorithms.</p>

<p>Jan-Willem was trying the following simple greedy idea:
for each traffic light,
change the green light when the queue for a not yet used light becomes longer
than the queue for the current light. Like the scoring function, this required a
lot of debugging to get working.</p>

<p>After some time, it turned out two of the issue were actually in my scoring
function. The first I had already fixed: the green light function broke on
intersections without a schedule assigned.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [01:58] Ragnar Groot Koerkamp: fix write
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Secondly, the outputs made by his greedy solution weren’t accepted by the judge system.
It turns out my hope that the online judge would ignore intersections with 0 assigned green
lights, but alas, that’s not the case. This required a small rewrite of the
<code>Output::write()</code> function, first counting the number of intersections with any
assignment at all, and only then looping over them to print the schedules.</p>

<p>The score log gets a bit messy here, but it seems that this solution managed
to bump A to the 2002 optimum, and it gained another 6k points on E.</p>

Let me explain.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="d047">Isn’t it weird that so many young people are already feeling burnt out after a few years of work? I keep meeting people who need a break after just their first year or two. I’ve also experienced burnout myself (twice even). The first time, I had to take a six-month break. The second time, which was very recent, I needed a full year off before I could come back to programming.</p><p id="41b7">This year, I’ve spent a lot of time with people outside tech and noticed one thing: We don’t complain much about our work. We complain about bad bosses and bad projects, but not about coding itself. We take passion for granted. Surprised? Go through job offers. Passion is often one of the must-haves listed on them. We are expected to love our job, and even more, we are expected to make programming the center of our universes.</p><p id="31ae">But what about the people who do not love programming and still do their job all the same? Try to identify yourself as one of those among your colleagues or on Twitter, and you will immediately be dismissed as being a bad developer. However, is that really the case? People who do their job and try something different after working hours can be amazing programmers too. Not everyone needs to come home and work on side projects, create blog posts and YouTube videos about coding, and read programming books for fun.</p><p id="4a37">I have been one of those people trying to work through all my spare time. For many years, I felt guilty if I didn’t spend all my waking time chasing some imaginary productivity goal — and guess where that landed me?</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman burying her head into her arms" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicotitto?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">nrd</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="61c0">Another aspect that is heavily biased against negative feedback is following new trends originating from FAANG companies. Try to speak up against SOA or Docker. Try to propose using an older, more mature language and SSR. It’s similar to having a passion for work.

However, it’s hard not to get on board — or at least pretend to be on board.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is often said in the same sentence as KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), yet they are often mutually exclusive practices. “Simple” means no unnecessary abstractions, yet starting with DRY code leads exactly to premature abstractions.</p><p id="9470">I personally use <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">the rule of 3X</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="3f47">“We have the delusion of reuse. Don’t feel bad. It’s an endemic disease among software developers. An occupational hazard, really.</p><p id="371b">…</p><p id="64fa">- It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single-use components, and<br>- A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.” — <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">Coding Horror</a></p></blockquote><p id="6a10">Obviously, I don’t treat it as a maxim. It’s more of a rule of thumb than good practice. But even here, we are getting to the same problem. People who dare suggest using singleton or any other hated anti-patterns are perceived as less than stellar developers.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="dc25">The expectation that <em>real</em> software developers, hackers, and geeks are defined by their vocation feels like being in some sort of RPG game. Your trade will forever define you, and once you choose this path, there is no way back.</p><p id="d74d">We, as developers, are expected to love programming. But why? The simple truth is that it is good for employers. How many horror stories have come out of game dev? Yet many young people dream about working in the gaming industry only to be replaced by another batch of young, naive people after a few years.</p><p id="b875">We need to normalize people not “loving” to code, and we need to normalize having a healthy work-life balance in tech. We need people to be more open about their opinions, even if they are against the moment’s hype.</p><p id="62c6">Don’t get me wrong, I really like being a software developer and I like programming. However, I am not sure if I love it being the center of my universe anymore.</p><p id="e18c">I want to try other things, and that is absolutely OK.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, February 23, 2021</em></p><p>I like writing quick little scripts to avoid having to remember how to do things. Most of the time I start in bash, thinking the task won't be too complicated... but then before I know it I'm having to reread the bash man pages to figure out how arrays work for the thousandth time.</p><p>So really, I'd rather write scripts in a language that offers some more safety and better data structures. We're trying to learn Haskell at work, so maybe that?</p><p>Let's see a hello world:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env runghc

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>=</span><span> putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>That seems pretty reasonable, and only takes like 300ms to compile and run. Not awful, but it's not as fast as a bash script, and it means I have to use Haskell's standard prelude instead of something safer like <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/projects/relude">relude</a> or <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/nri-prelude">nri-prelude</a>.</p><p>It's reasonable to solve this, though: I can just use <code>nix-shell</code> to get a <code>ghc</code> with packages.</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell
#</span><span>!</span><span>nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell </span><span>-</span><span>p </span><span>"(pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (ps: [ ps.text ]))"
</span><span>#</span><span>!</span><span>nix</span><span>-</span><span>shell </span><span>-</span><span>i runghc

{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>Well, that works, but I've traded speed for flexibility: run time has grown to over 2 seconds! Eep!</p><p>I don't think I should have to make this trade, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script"><code>nix-script</code></a>. It transparently manages a compilation cache for these kinds of scripts, and lets you specify dependencies and build commands inside your source file!</p><p>That means the <code>nix-shell</code> example above can be rewritten like so:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script
#</span><span>!</span><span>buildInputs (pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>haskellPackages</span><span>.</span><span>ghcWithPackages (ps</span><span>:</span><span> [ ps</span><span>.</span><span>text ]))
#</span><span>!</span><span>build ghc </span><span>-</span><span>O </span><span>-</span><span>o </span><span>$</span><span>OUT_FILE </span><span>$</span><span>SCRIPT_FILE

</span><span>{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>The first time you run that, it'll compile the script to a binary, then run it. That takes about two seconds on my machine. The second time, and going forward until you change the script, it detects that it already compiled to a binary, so it just runs the compiled version. That takes 30ms or so for me! Big improvement!</p><p>But it's really not that fun to have to figure out that <code>#!build</code> line every time, and I always forget how to call <code>pkgs.haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages</code> correctly... so there's also a wrapper script called <code>nix-script-haskell</code> that makes this nicer:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>haskellPackages text

{-# </span><span>LANGUAGE</span><span> OverloadedStrings #-}

</span><span>import </span><span>Data.Text.IO

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>putStrLn </span><span>"Hello, World!"
</span></code></pre><p>And, in addition to the speed boost, we can depend on any package in the Nix ecosystem! For example, here's how you'd add and call <code>jq</code>:</p><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>#</span><span>!/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>env nix</span><span>-</span><span>script</span><span>-</span><span>haskell
#</span><span>!</span><span>runtimeInputs jq

</span><span>import </span><span>System.Process

</span><span>main </span><span>:: IO </span><span>()
main </span><span>= </span><span>do
</span><span>  formatted </span><span>&lt;-
</span><span>    readProcess
      </span><span>"jq"
</span><span>      [</span><span>"--color-output"</span><span>, </span><span>"."</span><span>]
      </span><span>"{</span><span>\"</span><span>name</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>Atlas</span><span>\"</span><span>, </span><span>\"</span><span>species</span><span>\"</span><span>: </span><span>\"</span><span>kitty cat</span><span>\"</span><span>}"
</span><span>  putStr formatted
</span></code></pre><p>It's also pretty easy to create more wrapping interpreters, so we also ship one for bash. Even though it's not a compiled language, we can cache the nix environment with the exact dependencies the script needs!</p><p>You can get this at <a href="https://github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script">github.com/BrianHicks/nix-script</a>. There are installation instructions in the README, both for standalone use and use within a larger Nix project.</p><p>Enjoy, and let me know if—and how—you use this!</p></article></div>]]>

In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a <code>prod.secrets.exs</code> which is used to configure an application in a production environment.</p><p>The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them — this was not an ideal scenario.</p><p>Slab, <a href="https://slab.com/">the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge</a>, discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult — as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.</p><p>As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config &amp; dev/prod parity in the <a href="https://12factor.net/">twelve factor app methodology</a>.</p><p>Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Hush implements Elixir's <code>Config.Provider</code> behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.</p><p>In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.</p><pre><p><span></span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>Hush</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Web</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>http:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>port:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"PORT"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>cast:</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>RedshiftRepo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Features</h2><p>Hush ships, today, with the following features:</p><ul><li>Extensible providers.

                    <p>Since our founding six years ago, it has been a core tenet at Codecov to provide the best code coverage analytics to developers and organizations.</p>
<p>To give our developers a better grasp of the code coverage landscape, we have compiled our most significant learnings from 2020 in our new annual <strong>State of Open Source Code Coverage</strong>. Here is what we found.</p>
<hr>
<h2>General Codecov Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov is dedicated to being free forever for open-source projects. We saw an incredible level of usage on our platform to analyze code coverage on your repositories.</p>




<h2>Code Coverage Usage by Language</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to be language agnostic, ensuring that developers across the board can get code coverage data. We present metrics around language usage by popularity and by the average code coverage for projects of a language.</p>




<h2>Codecov CI Usage</h2>
<p>Codecov continues to work with all CIs in the developer ecosystem. In 2020, however, we saw a meteoric rise in usage of GitHub Actions.</p>


<h2>Featured Open Source Repositories</h2>
<p>Our open-source community continues to be a cornerstone of our product development. We take a step back to showcase and congratulate some of our more popular repositories and their efforts to reach high code coverage.</p>


<h2>Codecov Benefits</h2>
<p>Our goal is to help developers merge their code with confidence. We continually work to see how adding code coverage can benefit projects.</p>

	<p>The OpenPush project aims to create a free and open source self-hosted replacement for Android Push Notifications usually sent through Google's proprietary Firebase Cloud Messaging platform. This started as a <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/open-source-push-service-fuer-android-apps/">PrototypeFund project</a>. Development is still ongoing.</p>
	<h5>Concept</h5>
	<p><img width="100%" src="https://bubu1.eu/concept.png"></p><p>The green components (PushClient and PushServer) in this high-level overview are part of this project. The red components are different apps and their corresponding webservices using the push functionality.</p>
	<h5>Benefits</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Free Software.</b> FCM is a proprietary service and the Firebase client libs are closed source. This makes projects including fcm libraries effectively non-free software which i.e. cannot be added to the FOSS <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> appstore.</li>
		<li><b>Self-hosted.</b> When self-hosting a open source project, there's no dependency on an external service anymore.</li>
		<li><b>User is in control.</b> A smartphone user can chose a pushserver instance, possibly self-hosted or hosted by a trusted entity.  This instance's url is communicated to the webservice together with the app token to the push-notification producer. Push-notifications will only be sent to this server.</li>

    <p>We live in an industry that celebrates and demands success. From posts that proudly show metrics that are up and to the right, to App Store feature tweets - we love to see others hitting on their current ventures. And why not? It’s fun! I love it too and I’ve shared my own homeruns plenty of times.</p>

<p>But have you noticed that most of the “open startups” are the ones who’ve already found market validation or are on a hot streak? I admit - it’s a lot more fun to share when the getting is good as opposed to when you wake up to zero downloads.</p>

<p>Everyone has started from the bottom though, so today I’d like to take a second and showcase some of the worst things I’ve made from early on in my career that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Made no money</li>
  <li>Won over zero users and</li>
  <li>Whose only fans and reviews were from my immediate family (thanks for that 5 star review Mom!)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="christmas-lister">Christmas Lister</h3>
<p>Ah, Christmas Lister. I got the idea to make a Christmas List app on November 15th. It shipped sometime shortly after. This was my first memory of pulling an all nighter on a project.</p>

<p>Just check out that icon:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cd06749d6dd546ff5fe4d499a590da29747a2fa/854e5/assets/images/tts_xmaslister.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>At the height of skeuomorphism, green developers such as myself wielded Photoshop with might and glory. As I browsed the websites with free .pdfs and stuffed them into my interface, my thirst for more leather bound table views was matched only by my desire for more Christmas Joy to be plastered throughout the app<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/36aa878a89197486883dd4d92a8ed913a1807d0e/4ae87/assets/images/tts_xmaslister1.png" alt="Christmas Lister App Store Listing"></p>

<p>And I remember this one as clear as day. I rushed to my iMac the day after release and saw the sales numbers:</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>As in O-N-E! Later that day, I found out it was my manager’s daughter at the Steakhouse I was a server at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My daughter made me buy your crappy app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My old manager, circa early 2010s</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In retrospect, he was right on the nose.</p>

<section>
    <div>
        <p><span>let</span> concatenatedThoughts = <span>"""</span></p>
        <p>Fun fact, this was actually made inside a game engine. I still was just picking up coding at the time, and there was no support for any sort of array or general collection structure. That meant that each and every single slot to make a list with present ideas was hardcoded ahead of time (i.e. var list1present1, etc).</p>
        <p><span>"""</span></p>
    </div>
</section>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> User interfaces require so much thought and less .pdfs, ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing and channel your excitement into <em>less</em> action and more thinking before you fire away.</p>

<h3 id="spend-stack-version-1">Spend Stack Version 1</h3>
<p>My first stab at good ol’ Spend Stack. Before it <a href="https://swiftjectivec.com/a-new-home-for-spend-stack/">became a success</a>, it was a jumbled mess of hidden gestures to navigate, bright and contrasty colors and a nonsensical onboarding flow that had you flying through cartoon clouds (I still was high on those .pdfs from Christmas Lister):</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/87c38e45772f71b60f1967a841e7413107288741/c3fb1/assets/images/tts_ss1.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 UI"></p>

<p>At this point, I started to trade out my love of free vector graphics for open source projects on Github. If it looked cool, I threw it into my podfile. Never mind if the app needed it, <em>this thing makes freakin’ blur views sooooooo trivial</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>!</p>

<p>I love this app. It clearly demonstrated the burden and the benefit of having an inexperienced dev executing on an actually good idea. I mean that gracefully too. Once you’re past this phase, it’s easy to become a kvetch about rookie mistakes. We’re quick to forget that we made them too.</p>

<p>You don’t go from this:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c12415684a674377f2d2d824263dedc2ed81616/394a6/assets/images/tts_ss2.png" alt="Spend Stack V1 Lists View"></p>

<p>To this over overnight:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1455b1b07364b592ee3f8e88e5d7ba40b04b5292/f8077/assets/images/tts_ss3.png" alt="Spend Stack V2 Features"></p>

<p>There are <em>six years</em> between those images.</p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> A great idea for an app can still result in crappy app, take time to learn about design and holy moses don’t toss in an open source project just because it’s shiny.</p>

<h3 id="halo-timer">Halo Timer</h3>
<p>My best worst effort, by far. My hopes were riding high on this one - I had made some janky apps already, and this time  - I knew better!</p>

<p>To be fair, this one did have a watch extension, quick action short cuts and a user flow that was actually useable. Plus, that parallax effect with the UI on the visor was neat<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d3ce684d2118a3b9598429cd913cd376de22663/06f7b/assets/images/tts_halovisor.png" alt="The Halo Timer Visor"></p>

<p>So what went wrong here? Let’s pop into multitasking right qui….oh, oh no!</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5cb17c79281b6348fafcb7314665fa4a7b756f50/19667/assets/images/tts_halomulti.png" alt="The Halo Timer Multitasking on iOS"></p>

<p>Our proclivity to adhere to Master Chief’s visor was both awesome and troublesome. Accessibility was near impossible, as was reframing the .pdf of the UI to other device sizes. Dynamic type just couldn’t hang.</p>

<p>But, what you can <em>see</em> here is that I was learning. Let’s not use any funky gestures to navigate, let’s make it easy to at least get around using a standard <code>UIKit</code> control people know like table views. Progress:</p>

<p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" role="presentation" srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/88c77148d28d19175f163a9156acd04e38de18ea/a3637/assets/images/tts_haloui.png" alt="Halo Timer UI"></p>

<p><strong>Main lessons learned:</strong> Just because you now <em>know</em> better doesn’t mean you’ll actually <em>make</em> something better - but if you’re here, you’re soooooooo close to getting it!</p>

<h3 id="sowhat">So…..what?</h3>
<p>So why share all of this, aside from the laughs? Is there some wise sage advice I’m inevitably about to drop?</p>

<p>I mean, I dunno? Here’s what I found when writing this:</p>

<p>These projects meant everything to me at the time. I look back at these crash-and-burns and I remember being absolutely brimming with <strong>passion</strong> and pure, unfettered <strong>excitement</strong> as they came together. I mean, these are the projects that made me! I stayed up late, googled non-stop and thought about them all the time.</p>

<p>There’s no way I’d be where I am today if I didn’t dump hours into them. We tend to knock ourselves after launch and think “You know what, that failed. That didn’t work.”</p>

<p>When you’re in it, it feels that way. May I suggest to you that we need to flip that line of thinking from:</p>

<p>“I failed”</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>“I made a freaking thing <em>from nothing</em>, I created this! It may not have worked, but I have 5,433 things to bring to my <em>next</em> thing, and I also know more about this space I tried to launch in.”</p>

<p>In short, you rocked it. Always remember that character is carved out rather than instantly created. Each of these misses can eventually add up to a win.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>When you make things that don’t end up working, and you keep shipping things that don’t sell you might put yourself in a dangerous spot without even realizing it. It becomes <em>fait accompli</em> that even before you spin up your next Xcode project, it’s just not gonna work. If that’s you - keep pushing! You’re close, and I promise you that.</p>

<p>I’m so thankful for the things I made that sucked, because without them I would not have made the things that didn’t.</p>

<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>

<p><span>P</span>ascale Elie saw her hometown fall apart from her house in Port-au-Prince. The massive earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 left the capital city in ruins. Elie, an economist who was then working for an insurance company, watched as the financial system collapsed in the wake of the disaster. <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/06/Gates-Foundation-and-USAID-Announce-Innovative-Fund-to-Incentivize-Mobile-Money-Services-in-Haiti">Over a third of physical branches — long concentrated in the capital city —</a> fell apart overnight. Even though only 10% of residents were account holders, hours-long lines formed around the few remaining banks. The country’s fragile power grid failed and left millions of Haitians in the dark. Foreign aid struggled to plug the gap, as distributing cash through traditional means proved difficult and time-consuming — on average, <a href="https://www.betterthancash.org/news/is-cash-the-enemy-of-the-poor">locals waited 12 days</a> to access emergency aid in the midst of Haiti’s worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p>



<p>Elie eventually quit her job and threw herself into building a solution. She founded a fintech called HaitiPay which in turn launched Lajan Cash, a trailblazing mobile wallet and payments system that allows anyone with a cellphone to get paid, transfer money, purchase from mom-and-pop stores, or receive remittances from abroad. By dialing a short number, clients can send requests for transfers and payments from their phones, without having to rely on an internet connection. Since its early days, HaitiPay has guaranteed that all transactions were traceable and available between different financial institutions — a level of interoperability that remains an exception to the rule in the country. The service was one of the first in Haiti: an innovative company looking to disrupt a slow-moving and inefficient industry whose shortcomings were painfully obvious. “I said to myself, ‘That’s what I’m going to do for the rest of my life,’” Elie told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, her life-long mission was starting to look a lot like a Silicon Valley–scripted underdog fairy tale. Early on, when she envisaged the company, she jumped through all the ludicrous legal hoops required to create a startup in a heavily regulated market. Then, when she looked to attract customers, her company stood against contenders that had dominated the area for generations but stood as yet unaware of fintech’s potential. If things had panned out as the standard Silicon Valley–endorsed fairy tale claims, disruptive innovation and perseverance should have been enough for Elie to beat the traditional players of the local financial scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, a decade on, it isn’t pioneers like HaitiPay that dominate the fintech scene. Digital wallets and payments are now firmly established in the country’s mostly informal economy. Contrary to the underdog myth that pervades startup culture, the fintech market has been taken over by the establishment — oligarchic banks and telecommunications companies — thanks to archaic regulation and precarious access to funding.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the quake, the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/04/Statement-on-Emergency-Response-to-Haiti">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> rushed to Haiti with millions in emergency aid, three days after the catastrophe. Less than six months later, it had partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development to offer <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/06/Gates-Foundation-and-USAID-Announce-Innovative-Fund-to-Incentivize-Mobile-Money-Services-in-Haiti">a $10 million grant</a> to mobile money solutions that could streamline fund distribution. An initial $4 million would be split between two companies that proposed the best solutions; the remainder would be given to the winners, if and when they hit at least 100,000 transactions in the country. Contestants had to deliver solutions that weren’t only innovative but could distribute funds to a large user base as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aid announcement highlighted the same idealized case study that Elie had identified months prior: M-Pesa — a Kenyan peer-to-peer payment and money transfer system with <a href="http://www.fsassessment.umd.edu/publications/effects-mpesa-kenya.html">over 9 million customers</a> — was deemed to be the most promising model on which to base Haiti’s nascent fintech sector. At the time, this African startup’s success stood in stark contrast to the hundreds of mobile banking initiatives that had been unable to grow their customer base beyond a handful of users. Soon M-Pesa had put East Africa in the spotlight as the region that, by 2011, concentrated <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/resources/state-of-the-industry-results-from-the-2011-global-mobile-money-adoption-survey/">80% of all mobile money operations worldwide</a>. What became known as the “M-Pesa model” seemed to be Haiti’s ticket out of financial ruin; cellphones appeared to be the perfect substitute to the country’s ailing physical infrastructure. Even better, nearly every Haitian knew how to use one, and most households had at least one device — which could cost <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">as little as $20</a> by 2010, down from $300 in the early aughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gates Foundation and USAID set a high bar for access to the award: at least 100,000 transactions in the first six months. Unsurprisingly, the two final winners were companies with big preexisting customer bases, Jamaica-based Digicel and its main competitor, U.S.-founded Voilà. In conjunction, the two giants covered <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-haitis-cellphone-networks-failed">over 3 million cellphone subscribers</a> on the island and would later merge to create Haiti’s most powerful fintech, MonCash.</p>



<p>MonCash’s overwhelming arrival onto the scene revealed something about its model that global fintech-watchers across the board had failed to realize. Mobile money operations in emerging economies in East Africa or Haiti didn’t succeed only because their approach was particularly innovative. Their success rather depended on very unique local contexts and their ability to scale up. “M-Pesa was based on something that Kenyans were used to: sending airtime to each other as a form of currency, instead of using transfer services like Western Union,” Erin Taylor, an economic anthropologist who researched the early days of mobile money in Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. But the M-Pesa model would only truly experience success when it received backing from important transnational corporations. Subsequent studies have found that its business model depended on widespread adoption to become “<a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/m-pesa-a-mobile-money-success-story-from-kenya/">commercially viable,</a>” which turned out to be easier for a telecommunications company with <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/What-makes-a-successful-mobile-money-implementation.pdf">nearly 80% of market share</a>. The secret to Africa’s most successful fintech lay, not in its disruptive innovation, but rather in its alliance with Safaricom — a local subsidiary associated with telecommunications giant Vodafone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With massive telecommunications behind them, both M-Pesa and MonCash were able to rely on established telecommunications networks to process transactions at virtually no cost for end users. Selling a mobile-based service to millions of customers was no problem to the tried-and-tested companies. With an established consumer base, players like MonCash could make their services as widespread as possible. Those already using Digicel’s services as an operator could easily join its digital wallet and carry out transactions with acquaintances — likely Digicel users as well. Deploying its considerable resources, Digicel positioned agents in Port-au-Prince and other Haitian cities and explained electronic money to customers, by distributing <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=&amp;id=ve01DwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=m-pesa+%22haiti%22&amp;ots=t_xq0zUTUk&amp;sig=Nv2DSJBcI57hLz25qwEyJGk0XCE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=m-pesa%20%22haiti%22&amp;f=false">pamphlets and comics about it in local Kreyol</a>, soon meeting the transaction target set by the Gates Foundation and USAID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/capturing-the-promise-of-mobile-banking-in-emerging-markets">mass adoption</a> made the giant players bigger but left little room for underdogs, like HaitiPay. To Elie’s great dismay, it turned out that it wasn’t the “M-Pesa model” that promised success in the Haitian fintech scene: being first to market wasn’t enough, you had to be big. MonCash grew on the back of the Safaricom model, supported by the country’s main telecommunications giant. “People would ask if we were like Digicel,” Elie said to <em>Rest of World</em>. “But we were there before, you know?” The Digicel-MonCash fintech solution would go on to grow 15 times faster than Elie’s HaitiPay over the 2010s, reaching over 1.5 million Haitians to her 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make matters worse, Elie wasn’t merely competing against big telecommunications companies. According to Haitian law, she wasn’t even allowed to take these giants on single-handedly. Any service that relied on electronic money had to operate under an establishment banking partner, so HaitiPay was forced to delay its launch, as it negotiated with its own competitors. She waited nearly two years to receive her stamp of approval from a partner, only to launch in an industry that had been taken over by telecommunications companies months prior. Making the best of a bad situation, Elie found a way to use her legally mandated partner to her advantage: when reaching out to potential customers, she would highlight the bank’s trusted and well-established brand, instead of presenting HaitiPay as a mere newbie.</p>



<p>Unfazed, she set up operations in a small office in Port-au-Prince, designing a tool that worked smoothly amid Haiti’s power outages and expensive internet. Though her system avoided dependence upon internet connectivity, HaitiPay still relied on a proper phone signal — provided, of course, by her telecommunications competitors, Digicel and NatCom. Companies reliant on mobile services, like hers, had to negotiate with the local duopoly to guarantee its operations ran smoothly. “You have to either marry one or the other,” Clifford Reginald Nau, who manages the tech incubator Alpha Haiti, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Elie married both, in order to guarantee that clients from both telecommunications companies could still choose her services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Elie had painstakingly grown her clientele, HaitiPay would go on to benefit from the eventual crashing of the fintech wave in the Caribbean. The industry had become impossible to ignore, creating new <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">giants valued at $10 billion</a> and disrupting services from <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/okash-microlending-public-shaming/">microlending</a> to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/now-serving-halal-apps/">digital banking</a>.

<p>Many frontend developers might see security as a non-functional concern, that is handled by the security department and that they instead should just focus on feature development. The reality is that learning about security actually <strong>forces you to gain knowledge</strong> about how the <strong>browser works</strong> thus it can <strong>make you a better Angular developer</strong> in general.</p>
<p>High-performing teams, in this day and age, are usually <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/the-three-building-blocks-of-elite-angular-teams/">autonomous DevOps teams</a> and use <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/implementing-continuous-delivery-through-five-steps/">continuous delivery</a> for faster feature delivery. This way of working is only possible if we, frontend developers, also take <strong>responsibility for the security</strong> as we build features.</p>

<p>This post aims to give you the know-how to&nbsp;<strong>build security into your feature development</strong>&nbsp;and become a better developer by gaining a higher understanding of the browser and security concepts that are relevant for Angular developers.</p>
<p>I will go through the&nbsp;<strong>OWASP top 10 security threats</strong>&nbsp;that relate to Angular development and explain how to mitigate each one in this post.</p>
<h2>What is OWASP top 10?</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten is the top ten list of web security risks from the Open Web Application Security Project foundation. It consists of a group of security experts who release a top 10 list of relevant security risks every 3-4 years which many companies use to focus their security effort.</p>
<h2>OWASP 2013 to 2017</h2>
<p>The OWASP top ten has evolved through the years and has gotten rid of a couple of security risks, that are no longer relevant enough to make the top ten in the 2017 edition.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for owasp top 10 2020 vs 2017" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/owaspdocumen.png?zoom=2&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of these threats, the ones that relate to Angular development are:</p>
<ol><li><a href="#csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a></li><li><a href="#sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></li><li><a href="#xxs">Cross-Site Scripting</a></li><li><a href="#using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></li></ol>
<p>The other threats are mostly handled on the backend and are not covered in this post.</p>
<h2>Basic security concepts</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some basic security concepts to improve our understanding of how the browser works.</p>
<h3>Same-Origin Policy</h3>
<p>The same-origin policy (SOP) is a security concept <strong>that limits how one origin can interact with other origins</strong>.<br>An origin consists of a protocol, domain and port:</p>
<p><code>protocol://domain:port</code> eg. <code>https://google.com:443</code></p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="295" src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=300%2C86&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C221&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=600%2C173&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?w=1154&amp;ssl=1 1154w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/christianlydemann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png?resize=1024%2C295&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>In a same-origin policy, <strong>reads</strong> are typically <strong>prohibited </strong>across origins and <strong>writes</strong> are typically <strong>allowed</strong> across origins.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>What?</strong></td><td><strong>Mostly</strong> <strong>Allowed</strong>?</td><td><strong>Allowed</strong> <strong>Operations</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>writes</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Links, redirects, form submissions</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>reads</strong></td><td><strong>No</strong></td><td>None</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Origin <strong>embedding</strong></td><td><strong>Yes</strong></td><td>Scripts, CSS, Images</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>SOP: What is allowed?</figcaption></figure>
<p>For <strong>writes</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, <strong>redirects</strong>, and <strong>form submissions </strong>are <strong>allowed</strong>. The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; <span>everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The general rule of thumb with SOP and cross-origin <strong>writes</strong> is; everything that you can do with an <strong>HTML form</strong> is <strong>allowed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> from another origin is <span>not allowed per default</span> (more on CORS headers soon). Doing so will result in this error (you try to fetch from another origin):<br></p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/fdezromero.com/content/images/size/w2000/2019/02/cors-error.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for cors error" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/fdezromero.com/content/images/size/w2000/2019/02/cors-error.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p><strong>Embedding</strong> is generally <strong>allowed</strong> when embedding scripts, CSS, and images thus are normally a common attack surface as well (as we will see later).</p>
<h3>Implicit and explicit authentication</h3>
<p><strong>Implicit authentication</strong> means the authentication is based on something the browser automatically (implicitly) sends on each request. This could be <strong>cookies</strong>, <strong>HTTP basic auth</strong>, and <strong>TLS client certificates</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of authentication is, it is possible for an attacker, to do <strong>authenticated writes</strong> on behalf of a user if the servers are not explicitly protecting against this (eg. cross-site request forgery attacks, as we will soon see more about).</p>
<p><strong>Explicit authentication</strong> means manually (explicitly) sending the authentication token by the developer such as via an HTTP header. The most common way to do this is using <a href="https://christianlydemann.com/creating-an-openid-connect-system-with-angular-8-and-identityserver4-oidc-part-1/" data-type="post" data-id="106">OAuth bearer tokens</a> in the headers.</p>
<h3>Cross-origin resource sharing</h3>
<p>Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism, controlled by HTTP response headers on a server, for <strong>allowing origins to perform</strong> <strong>“non-HTML form compliant” requests</strong> to the server. On such a request, the browser will first do a <strong>preflight </strong>request, for loading the CORS headers and then do the actual request.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for cors preflight" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/729/1*JBbctZQfohc-YR6yUn_HMQ.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>The browser <strong>automatically</strong> sends the <strong>preflight</strong> (OPTIONS), if this is a cross-origin non-form request, for reading the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The client will proceed with the actual request if the header is present and valid (needs to either contain the client’s origin or *).</p>
<p>Here’s an <strong>example</strong> <strong>preflight request</strong> and <strong>response</strong>:</p>

<p>A “non-HTML form compliant” request, is a request that <strong>contains custom headers</strong> and <code><strong>content-type</strong></code> other than the standard HTML form content types: </p>
<p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>,&nbsp;<code>multipart/form-data</code>, or&nbsp;<code>text/plain</code></p>
<p>The best practice with cross-origin resource handling is to <strong>whitelist</strong> the origins, which are permitted to call the server instead of using wildcard *.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></p>
<p><strong>Do</strong>: <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://somedomain.com</code></p>
<h2 id="csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>
<p>CSRF attacks involve the attacker taking advantage of<strong> implicit authentication</strong> such as a <strong>session cookie</strong> to make you do an <strong>authenticated request to a site</strong>.<br>CSRF attacks are handled automatically by many frameworks and mechanisms such as CMS and OAuth2 so is no longer a big enough threat to make it in 2017 OWASP top ten but is still worth knowing how to mitigate against in Angular apps.</p>
<p>A typical CSRF attack involves an attacker hosting a site, which is <strong>doing requests to a target website</strong>, once we user visits the attacker site. This will work if the target site uses <strong>implicit authentication</strong> and the user is <strong>already authenticated</strong> on the target site (and there is no CSRF protection).</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CSRF steps illustration" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vaadata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CSRF_visio.jpg?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Due to SOP this attack will only work when:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Write</strong> operation (can be GET or POST)</li><li><strong>Standard</strong> HTML <strong>form content types</strong>:<ul><li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li><li>multipart/form-data</li><li>text/plain</li></ul></li><li><strong>Implicit authentication</strong></li><li>Only <strong>standard headers</strong></li></ul>
<p>If the server contains <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> we would only require implicit authentication to do a CSRF attack (did I tell you to not use wildcards with your CORS?) as non-standard headers and non-form content-type are what is causing a CORS preflight to be necessary.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>User visits attacker site, which performs a form request to <strong>bank.com</strong> in which the user is authenticated using a session cookie. The site can now trigger eg. a payment on behalf of the user’s account.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>For the most part, CSRF is not a security threat anymore as <strong>most Angular apps use explicit authentication such as OAuth2</strong>.</p>
<p>If your app is using implicit authentication eg. using a cookie, then the simplest way to protect yourself against CSRF attacks is to:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</li><li><strong>Verify the custom header</strong> is present on each request (server)</li></ol>
<p>Because custom headers can’t be sent across domains without a CORS preflight this will protect you against CSRF if you are not using <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Send a custom header</strong> on each request (client)</h4>
<p>Angular’s <code>HttpClient</code> <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http#security-xsrf-protection">automatically sends a X-XSRF-TOKEN</a> header on each request when performing a mutating request, such as POST.</p>
<h4>2. <strong>Verify a custom header</strong> is visible on each request (server)</h4>
<p>For Node Express servers, this is easily handled by the middleware <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html">csurf</a> which will <strong>check for the CSRF header being present</strong> on each request.</p>
<h2 id="sensitive-data-exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
<p>Sensitive data exposure is about having sensitive data read by an attacker, either while in transit, such as for a <strong>man-in-the-middle </strong>attack, or by tampering with the requested page eg. if the <strong>DNS is hacked</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1" alt="sensitive data exposure" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/to_webp,q_lossless,ret_img,w_750/https://www.internetsecurity.tips/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-Sensitive-Data-Exposure.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h3>Man in the middle</h3>
<p>A <strong>man in the middle</strong> attack involves a <strong>mediating network device</strong>, that is able to read unencrypted data and tamper with the returned payload when a site is requested.</p>
<figure><img src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700" alt="Image result for sensitive data exposure" data-lazy-src="https://mikethetesternz.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mitm.jpeg?w=700&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>A man in the middle attack can occur even with HTTPS as we will see:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Requesting website</strong>, where <strong>first request</strong> per default is an <strong>http</strong> request</li><li><strong>Requests HTTP page</strong> on <strong>server</strong></li><li><strong>Server redirects</strong> to <strong>HTTPS</strong></li><li>Man in the middle <strong>requests HTTPS page</strong></li><li>The <strong>server responds</strong> with an HTTPS response</li><li>Interceptor <strong>rewrites HTTPS to HTTP</strong> and can <strong>inject</strong> <strong>malicious</strong> <strong>code</strong></li><li>The clients future requests are now <strong>HTTP</strong> can now be <strong>sniffed</strong> and <strong>tampered</strong> with by the <strong>man in the middle</strong></li></ol>

<p>The basic problem here is the <strong>first request is unencrypted</strong> and can thus be tampered with by the man in the middle.<br>There are two solutions to this; <strong>VPN</strong> and <strong>HSTS</strong> header.</p>
<p>VPN is not a security mechanism you can set up on your own site, so let’s focus on the <strong>HSTS header</strong>.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The solution is to ensure that the <strong>first request is HTTPS</strong> by using <strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security</strong> <strong>headers</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this, you make your frontend server return a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header.</p>

<p>By setting the expire-time more than one year, and setting includeSubDomains and preload, the site will be part of the browsers preload list which is a <strong>hardcoded list in browsers</strong> ensuring the site will only be requested over HTTPS. You can check if your domain is in the preload list <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">here</a>. Otherwise, the clients will <strong>perform an HTTP</strong> <strong>request</strong> every time the <strong>HSTS header expires</strong>.</p>
<h3>Hacked CDN</h3>
<p>Hacked DNS involves the attacker getting control over a DNS server and is able to point domains to other servers eg. their own malicious website.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1" alt="Image result for hacked dns" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2019/02/DNS-Hijacking.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>This malicious website might be, UI-wise, a clone of the original site but containing logic for eg. sniffing logins and credit cards.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>The solution to protecting your users against compromised DNS is to use the <strong>integrity</strong> attribute in the script tag, loading the DNS resource, which is a checksum mechanism to ensure the integrity of what the DNS serves:<br></p>

<p>Now you will get an error if the integrity is compromised in the CDN. This is supported by many DNS providers.</p>
<h2 id="xxs">Cross-Site Scripting</h2>
<p>Cross-site scripting is one of the most dangerous threats as it involves an <strong>attacker taking control over your app’s javascript</strong> by executing javascript from an input source in the app such as the <strong>data storage</strong> and <strong>URL</strong>.</p>

<p>Computer science teachers around the world are bestowing these superpowers upon the next generation of creators and builders. We built <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Replit Teams for Education</a> for them, and today we're officially taking Teams for Education out of beta. </p>

<p>Thank you teachers for beta testing Teams, for giving us invaluable product feedback, for helping one another out as part of a vibrant and diverse community of Replers, and for being a part of the history of computers.</p>
<p>William Gibson is famous for saying way back in 1992, that "the future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." If we asked you a year ago, you may have said we were already living in the computer age, or even that we had been for decades. But then in early 2020 COVID-19 happened and everything went "remote" and we all took a collective leap even further into the future. Today it's more obvious than ever that for children (and adults!) to participate in the riches of the new economy, they need to be able to design, control, and program the machines that we all use all day, every day.</p>
<p>On this vision to build powerful &amp; approachable tools that expand access to computing superpowers, Replit raised a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/seriesa">$20 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020. We're using the funds both to make learning more engaging for teachers and students and also to make work more fun and creative for professional software developers. We believe that the same things that make programming easier for beginners will also unlock productivity for experts. And when students know that they aren't just in a sandboxed, toy environment, but instead can use real-world tools and collaborate in real-time with their peers, they'll learn better.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/multiplayerart.png" alt="replit multiplayer art"></p>
<p>We've been working towards this vision since Amjad and Haya started Replit in 2016. And the initial beta release of Teams for Education over the summer of 2020 was a major step forward in that direction. From the start, early adopters like Toni loved the real-time multiplayer collaboration with their students, seeing how Replit could transform their classrooms.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, March 1, 2021</em></p><p>When I was optimizing <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/elm-csv-package-and-talk/">elm-csv</a>, I noticed that Elm's <code>String.startsWith</code> is implemented using JavaScript's <code>indexOf</code> method. It looks something like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>This strikes me as inefficient! Doesn't that mean that if <code>haystack</code> doesn't begin with <code>needle</code>, it'll still look through the whole string? That seems to waste a lot of cycles on work after we already know the result.</p><p>After thinking about it for a little bit, I imagined a faster way:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function </span><span>startsWith</span><span>(</span><span>haystack</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>) {
  </span><span>return </span><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>But, I didn't know for sure if it would be faster, so I started measuring things. After a few benchmarks things were looking promising! I found that <code>String.prototype.slice</code> and <code>String.prototype.length</code> operate in more-or-less constant time, and that <code>===</code>, while not constant-time, is heavily optimized.</p><p><em>Hypothetically</em>, I thought, this means that a <code>slice</code>-based implementation of <code>startsWith</code> could run much quicker than scanning through the whole string with <code>indexOf</code>.</p><h2 id="chrome-uses-actual-magic-in-their-strings">Chrome Uses Actual Magic in Their Strings</h2><p>But just to make sure my intuition about <code>indexOf</code> being slow was correct, I decided to benchmark that as well. Specifically, I decided to benchmark how long browsers took to find a single character in a string that doesn't contain the character:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"d"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>I expected that every time I multiplied <code>size</code> by 10, I should see roughly a 10x slowdown in operations per second. But then…</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>866,026,834</td><td>869,256,882</td><td>858,563,862</td><td>865,370,315</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>43,557,275</td><td>44,947,174</td><td>41,059,919 (-8.65%)</td><td>16,831,928 (-59.01%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>49,240,581</td><td>34,661,639 (-29.61%)</td><td>7,162,615 (-79.01%)</td><td>877,449 (-87.75%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Chrome has…&nbsp;NO REAL SLOWDOWN? WHAT? This data suggests that Chrome can find a substring in any length string in constant time. How is that even possible?</p><p>At this point, I felt pretty out of my depth, and decided I needed to ask my friend <a href="https://github.com/lukewestby">Luke Westby, Real-Life Computer Genius™</a>, what was going on. He knew right where to look and figured out that <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/dc712da548c7fb433caed56af9a021d964952728/src/strings/string-search.h#L194">Chrome has a special optimization for single-character search strings in <code>indexOf</code></a>. In other words, people have hand-tuned V8 over the years to go ridiculously fast in all sorts of situations, and this is one of them.</p><p>Well, OK, let's try finding some multi-character string instead. I used "nope", which doesn't trigger this optimization, but still fails to match "abc". Does that give us a result that matches my intuition?</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>885,211,831</td><td>863,845,523 (-2.41%)</td><td>849,821,335 (-1.62%)</td><td>837,391,727 (-1.46%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>58,648,716</td><td>44,107,472 (-24.79%)</td><td>40,529,513 (-8.11%)</td><td>16,768,019 (-58.63%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>102,071,445</td><td>26,242,114 (-74.29%)</td><td>4,212,339 (-83.95%)</td><td>467,329 (-88.91%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's <em>kinda</em> like what I expected, but Chrome is still incredibly fast at this! Well, OK, that's fine. Good for them. But at this point I got curious (and a little devious): how can I defeat Chrome's optimizations? What is the worst-case scenario that they can't possibly have handled already?</p><p>I tried to imagine the algorithm that you'd have to write to implement <code>indexOf</code> and came up with something like this:</p><ol><li>Look at the first character in <code>haystack</code>.</li><li>If it matches the first character in <code>needle</code>, look at the next pairs of characters in the two strings one by one.</li><li>If you get to the end of <code>needle</code> and they all match, you've found the index.</li><li>But if one pair doesn't match, you've got to start over at the next character in <code>haystack</code>.</li></ol><p>With that in mind, what's combination of <code>needle</code> and <code>haystack</code> would perform the worst? I think it's any pair of strings where <code>haystack</code> is all but the last character of <code>needle</code> repeated over and over. So, maybe a benchmark like this?</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>).</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>"abcd"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre><p>That can never succeed, but it'll make the browser do a lot of extra work reading the initially-matching "abc" over and over. Let's see the results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>1 "abc"</th><th>10 "abc"s</th><th>100 "abc"s</th><th>1,000 "abc"s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.182</td><td>877,221,230</td><td>863,929,216 (-1.52%)</td><td>688,398,676 (-20.32%)</td><td>125,023 (-99.98%)</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>61,384,762</td><td>12,874,505 (-79.03%)</td><td>1,366,202 (-89.39%)</td><td>137,245 (-89.95%)</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>100,546,438</td><td>25,948,095 (-74.19%)</td><td>4,170,375 (-83.93%)</td><td>467,753 (-88.78%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finally, Chrome has similar performance to other browsers. I don't think this is representative of real workloads, but even so Chrome performs admirably. Hats off to the V8 team for this implementation, but honestly, it's good to know they're still mortal!</p><h2 id="comparing-the-implementations">Comparing the Implementations</h2><p>So now that we know more about the component pieces involved in this optimization (for example, knowing to avoid single-character test strings), we can check if <code>slice</code> actually gives us a real-world speedup. In setting this up, I decided to go for the middle of the road to try and benchmark the browsers under something that you can kind of squint at and think "yeah, that will probably happen reasonably often in real life." In this case, that meant setup looked like this:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)
</span><span>needle </span><span>= </span><span>"abc"
</span></code></pre><p>Then the <code>indexOf</code> and <code>slice</code> benchmarks looked like the code at the top of this post:</p><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span><span>needle</span><span>) </span><span>=== </span><span>0
</span></code></pre><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>haystack</span><span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>needle</span><span>.length) </span><span>=== </span><span>needle
</span></code></pre><p>That gave me these results:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>871,312,454</td><td>870,810,291</td><td>-0.06%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 86.0</td><td>32,428,394</td><td>46,845,953</td><td>+44.46%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>430,854,455</td><td>1,352,674,261</td><td>+213.95%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Note that Chrome and Firefox had released new versions between me testing <code>indexOf</code> and this test. I kept the old data here because it doesn't seem to have changed the performance, but I just want to be up front that the versions are different!</p><p>Anyway, that said: looks like a result within the margin of error for Chrome (around 0.4%), but a reasonable speedup for Firefox and a big win for Safari.</p><p>What does the failure case look like? (Same <code>haystack</code>, but <code>needle = "nope"</code>):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Browser</th><th>indexOf</th><th>slice</th><th>% Diff</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chrome 88.0.4324.192</td><td>874,951,212</td><td>854,116,367</td><td>-2.44%</td></tr><tr><td>Firefox 85.0</td><td>31,026,729</td><td>22,180,114</td><td>-28.51%</td></tr><tr><td>Safari 14.0.1</td><td>4,189,768</td><td>1,508,770,435</td><td>+35,910.83%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This time, Chrome has a slowdown greater than the measurement error, which surprised me! Same with Firefox, but to a larger degree. But the real story here is Safari, which can now do this operation over 1.5 billion times per second. <em>Billion!</em> What even!</p><h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is It Worth It?</h2><p>So, with all that measurement done, is this optimization worth it? I'm actually not really sure. This is basically nothing in Chrome but means making some real performance tradeoffs in Firefox. And, even though it looks like a huge win in Safari, my claims can only be as strong as the underlying assumptions I'm making in choosing test data. So, just to be explicit about that:</p><ul><li>These benchmarks assume that <code>haystack</code> is a long-ish string (300 characters.) Many of the gains we see here are erased when the strings are short. Safari in particular, drops to only about a 100% gain in the failure case with a shorter string (I tested at 3, 30, 150 characters, all with similar results.)</li><li>The <code>needle</code> strings are neither a single character nor a worst-case scenario for <code>indexOf</code> performance.</li><li>Success and failure cases are equally likely. We can't make any assumption other than that at the runtime level, although we could make a good argument to switch this for individual applications. For example, we could choose to use <code>slice</code> in an application where we expected most checks on <code>startsWith</code> would succeed, since that's basically a wash in Chrome and much faster in Firefox and Safari.</li><li>We care about browsers based on global total share instead of splitting out into desktop or mobile. This is another area where you could make different decisions at the application level: if the users of your app skew more towards using Chrome or more towards Safari, this payoff for this optimization gets better or worse.</li></ul><p>Of course, if you can measure that your application <em>would</em> benefit from this optimization, go ahead and do it yourself! Calling <code>String.slice 0 (String.length haystack) === needle</code> has some overhead in Elm (due to equality having different semantics) but you may still able to get the majority of the benefits if your users are mostly using Safari or you're running iOS webkit views or something like that. Just make sure to actually measure it! Optimizations at this level can be helpful, but they're more often dwarfed by DOM stuff in the runtime.</p><p>As for me: at this point, I'm not going to make a PR to <code>elm/core</code> with this improvement, even I intended to when I set out. However, I found it interesting to look into these things, and I learned a lot about how strings are optimized in various browsers, so I'm gonna call it a win overall.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/>
March 2, 2021 | https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Kubernetes (k8s) has been all the rage for the last few years because application orchestration has become a de facto table-stakes requirement for production workloads running containers. “Containerising” applications is <em>relatively</em> straightforward, and most DevOps engineers worth their salt can create a few Dockerfiles and build images in a pipeline that are ready to run. But where do you “run” your Docker containers? And which versions do you deploy? And how do all the containers talk to each other? This is where orchestration comes into play and where a few options are proposed by large vendors. There are two main options available at the time of this writing: Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes which is offered by all the Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) providers, including even AWS.</p><p>The hope is that orchestration will allow companies to deliver their containerised applications to test and integration environments quickly and painlessly. The ideal scenario is that it “just works”, that is, you would snap your fingers and wait a few minutes before you see your application running in front of you. Ideally, you’d only need to specify the minimum information necessary to run your application: name, framework, dependencies, and so forth, preferably read out from existing configuration files you already have available. That’s the hope anyway.</p><p>Obviously, from the title, we are focusing on Kubernetes, mainly because it is available everywhere and mainly because the only <em>other</em> option is ECS which only proves the point of our thesis that Kubernetes is hard to use because AWS came up with their own solution that is <em>supposed to be</em> easier. But why is it so hard to use? How long would it reasonably take to get your application(s) running in K8s?? And why isn’t it easier?</p><h2 id="kubernetes-infrastructure-is-hard">Kubernetes Infrastructure Is Hard</h2><p>We always start with the infrastructure even though most companies wouldn’t build their own Kubernetes clusters themselves. If you were ever going to use a managed infrastructure service, K8s would be at the top of the list. I’m sure there are a few people who start up <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" title="Minikube documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">minikube</a> on their laptops and say to themselves, “Wow, this is easy! I can do this myself!!” This reminds me of people who start up an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html" title="Elasticsearch getting started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> container on their laptop and say, “Wow, we should implement this for our website!!” Fast forward to a production launch six months or a year later and the simple “We can do this ourselves” mantra turns into “I wish we didn’t have to do this anymore.”</p><p>If you were truly going to build your own Kubernetes cluster, you’d need to build all the control plane servers and services on your bare-metal or Virtual Machines (VMs) from an IaaS of choice, and then tie them all together with some fancy networking configuration to separate control-plane traffic from container traffic. You’d need to configure and run all of the control plane software and get them all talking to each other, running stably and monitored properly. Perversely, you’d be orchestrating the containers that orchestrate the application, but without a lot of orchestration! The fancy mirage that’s presented when you run minikube or Docker Desktop on Windows hides all the inception of running a container orchestration system using containers.</p><p>We haven’t even gotten to the complications of setting up ingresses (which are just nginx instances, usually) and load balancers that sit on top of or next to the control plane stack. A lot of the time, you’ll feel like you are creating a whole infrastructure just for your infrastructure to run (which isn’t unusual, but definitely doesn’t feel better than trying to orchestrate things yourself). We also haven’t gotten into the Role Based Authentication Controls and network policies that need to be set to support more than a single application or stack running in one cluster. The number of configuration points and server-side setups start to mount quickly and we haven’t even started orchestrating applications yet, which is the whole point of the orchestration system we’re supposed to be setting up.</p><p>And let’s suppose that you really do wade out into this deep North Atlantic Ocean of huge waves and death-inducing freezing waters, and build yourself a production-worthy ship that can orchestrate your containers into an actual application. You look back up at your calendar and it’s been six months or a year since you started, and you’re just now deploying a control plane that says, “Hello World!” You think you’re successful and you’re about to celebrate when you check the releases section on the website and now you have a new version of k8s to deploy!!!</p><p>I hear what you’re saying, “We’re <code>large company</code> and we have <code>lots of</code> DevOps engineers who are <code>top decile</code> of engineering talent in the whole world. We can handle all the heavy lifting. You’re just a whining, jealous baby.” I see you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDm9iNkLyPI" title="Datadog on Kubernetes presentation video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Datadog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg" title="Ticketmaster presents the keynote at Kubecon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ticketmaster</a>. (By the way, your accusations of jealousy might be correct. At the end of my good friend Justin Dean’s keynote speech where he shows the slides with all the team members, my picture should have been up there — but I had left the team two years earlier.) For everyone else, we all just decide to not spend six months or a year trying to build our control plane and start up our IaaS provider’s managed service and cross our fingers and pray.</p><h2 id="k8s-yaml-aint-markup-language">K8s YAML Ain’t Markup Language</h2><p>If you’ve skipped ahead and just started up a managed k8s cluster, you’re still in for a long and tedious journey wading into a deep sea of confusing YAML. YAML is to text what James Joyce’s <em><a href="https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm" title="Read Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Finnegan’s Wake</a></em> is to English. If you close one eye, use only your left pinky and right thumb to follow some brail, put your feet into ballet’s fifth position, and then recite World War II codes under your breath, then you will easily see that YAML is quite a breeze to comprehend. Once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding a bicycle over a frozen lake on centimeter-thin ice with rabid wolves chasing you. It’s as easy as trying to crash the Ancient Aliens cocktail party held in Fort Knox on gold smuggling days.</p><p>Look, it’s not actually that hard, right? Let’s say a guy walks up to you on the street. He’s a k8s expert and he’s going to show you how easy the “hello world” web service deployment is. The conversation goes like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>You: “Oh, I see.

You can use v1 as of k8s 1.9.</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>It’s actually removed in 1.16, but I wonder how many people have never</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>updated.”</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Him: “Start over.”</span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>You: “Stop with the Kinds everywhere!”</span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1”</span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>You: “This again.”</span></p><p><span>22</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>You: “Huh??”</span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>Him: “selector:”</span></p><p><span>28</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>You: “No.”</span></p><p><span>30</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>Him: “matchLabels:”</span></p><p><span>32</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span></p><p><span>35</span><span>Him: “app: nginx”</span></p><p><span>36</span><span></span></p><p><span>37</span><span>You: “That’s nearly the first thing I’ve understood about this so far.”</span></p><p><span>38</span><span></span></p><p><span>39</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>40</span><span></span></p><p><span>41</span><span>You: “Again?”</span></p><p><span>42</span><span></span></p><p><span>43</span><span>Him: “containers:”</span></p><p><span>44</span><span></span></p><p><span>45</span><span>You: “Okay, now we’re getting somewhere.”</span></p><p><span>46</span><span></span></p><p><span>47</span><span>Him: “image: nginx:1.14.2”</span></p><p><span>48</span><span></span></p><p><span>49</span><span>You: “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>50</span><span></span></p><p><span>51</span><span>Him: “ports:”</span></p><p><span>52</span><span></span></p><p><span>53</span><span>You: “Aiiiiieeee.”</span></p><p><span>54</span><span></span></p><p><span>55</span><span>Him: “containerPort: 80”</span></p><p><span>56</span><span></span></p><p><span>57</span><span>You: “I’m going home.

Try reading two k8s yaml examples and then generate one yourself from scratch. Even better, every day try a <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Practice a code kata daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code kata</a> practice of writing working and deployable configurations to Kubernetes.</p><p>I DARE YOU.</p><h2 id="copy-paste-aint-code">Copy Paste Ain’t Code</h2><p>I’m still chuckling over the previous section. I have to chuckle because this is the daily pain of my day-to-day existence and facing that pain directly is like standing in front of a bus being driven by Keanu Reeves on the freeway. The only thing that keeps my nose going back to the grindstone is the realization that working with NodeJs would be worse. The problem is that the Kubernetes docs are pretty good. You copy-paste some hello world examples and the outputs look like they work. You start to get pretty good at using kubectl. You can see vague shapes and outlines in YAML. You’re starting to gain confidence that you might be able to do something useful.</p><p>“Let’s try to move our application into Kubernetes!” you yell into the air as you emerge dripping wet from your bathtub wrapped only in a towel, like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-archimede/" title="Learn about the Archimedes fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Archimedes</a> sprinting through the streets of Syracuse. “We’ll just copy-paste some sections from here and here and put them there and there, and we’ll have our app running in no time,” you breathlessly explain to your coworkers. “Does it work?!” they excitedly ask. “Not yet. I mean, no. I need to indent the section and remove one piece that is not used in this spec. Then I need to decide if we use a deployment or a daemonset, but it’s almost there. I swear!”</p><p>First of all, put on some clothes. I’m all for taking a bath while thinking about kubernetes YAML files, but you need to get dressed afterward. Also, if you drop your Macbook Air into the bath with you, the results can be electrifying. I know. Second, here’s a riddle for you: how many YAML files do you think you need to run and deploy your application? Good thing that some people have ten fingers and ten toes because that’s probably how many you’ll need. And they’re all related but not really. You can copy-paste sections around if you’re adventurous and gullible, but you have no idea if the sections are compatible. There are only four required fields, all of which are gibberish, and everything goes under <code>spec:</code> (including <code>spec:</code>). Most of the sections are duplicated but only slightly. They vary microscopically in ways that matter macroscopically.</p><p>Copying and pasting is a wonderful art, and I’ve personally worked my entire adult career that way. I gleefully admit my whole output in life is like a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteNote" title="Example of a Ransome Note trope from movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ransom note</a> cut from stack overflow and documentation examples.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Taproot is a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin which will bring several new features and benefits to Bitcoin users. The Bitcoin community is hoping to activate Taproot in the near future, although its activation path is still unclear.</p>
<p>The Taproot upgrade is actually composed of three <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/b/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip/">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a> which define three distinct upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol: Schnorr Signatures, Taproot, and Tapscript. However, these three upgrades are known as the Taproot upgrade, and BIPs 340, 341, and 342 are often collectively referred to as BIP Taproot. Together, these upgrades introduce new, more efficient, flexible, and private ways of transferring bitcoin.</p>
<h2 id="schnorr-signatures">Schnorr Signatures</h2>
<p>BIP 340 introduces Schnorr signatures for use in Bitcoin. Schnorr signatures will bring several benefits to Bitcoin users, including superior privacy, lower fees, and more flexible multisig.</p>
<p>This BIP also specifies how Schnorr public keys and signatures are to be encoded for use in Bitcoin. Public keys used for Schnorr signatures are 32 bytes long, compared to ECDSA’s 33-byte public keys. Additionally, Schnorr signatures are 64 bytes long, compared to ECDSA signatures, which range from 70-72 bytes. These small space savings offer fee savings to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/">Learn more about Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h2 id="taproot">Taproot</h2>
<p>While BIP 340 defines the specification for generating and encoding Schnorr signatures and public keys, BIP 341 defines how Bitcoin’s protocol will integrate Schnorr signatures. Specifically, Bitcoin Script must be updated to also evaluate Schnorr signatures. Taproot also integrates <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkelized-alternative-script-tree-mast/">Merkelized Alternative Script Types (MAST)</a>, which allow users to lock outputs to multiple scripts.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions."></p><p>
    Pay-to-Taproot outputs are version 1 SegWit outputs, and all Taproot transactions are SegWit transactions.
  </p>
  
</div>
<h2 id="pay-to-taproot-p2tr">Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR)</h2>
<p>Taproot also introduces a new script type, a way of spending bitcoin. Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to pay to either a Schnorr public key <strong>or</strong> the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkle-root/">Merkle root</a> of a variety of other scripts. Using this new script type, a user can create a UTXO which can be unlocked and spent by either the owner of the private key or anyone who can satisfy the requirements of any script within the Merkle tree.</p>
<h3 id="key-aggregation">Key Aggregation</h3>
<p>Schnorr’s key aggregation feature enables this flexible functionality. When bitcoin is sent to a P2TR output, it is locked to a single public key, called Q. However, this public key Q is actually an aggregation of a public key P and a public key formed from the Merkle root of many other script types. Any of the alternative scripts in the Merkle tree can be used to spend the output.</p>
<p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/articles/taproot.png" alt="Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) allows users to send bitcoin to either a public key or multiple scripts of their choosing. This preserves privacy and space on the blockchain."></p>
<p>This design allows users to choose between complex, arbitrary scripts as well as simple pay-to-public-key functionality at the time of spending, rather than at the time of receiving. It also makes all Taproot outputs look similar. Because multisig outputs, single sig outputs, and other complex smart contracts all look the same on the blockchain, many chain analysis heuristics will become unusable, preserving privacy for all Taproot users.</p>
<h2 id="tapscript">Tapscript</h2>
<p>In order to implement P2TR transactions, BIP 342 adds and updates several <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/o/opcode/">opcodes</a>. These new scripts are used to verify Taproot spends and Schnorr signatures, and they are collectively known as Tapscript.</p>
<p>Tapscript was designed to maximize future flexibility of P2TR spending in order to allow for upgrades which are not yet foreseen.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-taproot">The Benefits of Taproot</h2>
<p>The Taproot upgrade offers many benefits to Bitcoin users who adopt Taproot as well as those who do not. The introduction of Schnorr signatures offers significant benefits to privacy and security, but Taproot and Tapscript also bring advantages of their own.</p>
<p>➤ <a href="https://river.com/learn/what-are-schnorr-signatures/#the-advantages-of-schnorr-signatures">Learn more about the benefits of Schnorr signatures.</a></p>

<h3 id="space-savings">Space Savings</h3>
<p>Most Taproot (P2TR) outputs consume less space on the blockchain than normal <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2pkh/">P2PKH</a> or <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/p/p2wpkh/">P2WPKH</a> outputs. This is mostly due to the fact that P2TR outputs lock bitcoin directly to a public key, not the hash of the public key. This makes sending to Taproot outputs slightly more expensive, because public keys take up more space than public key hashes. However, spending Taproot outputs is significantly cheaper because the public key is included in the scriptPubKey, and thus does not need to be included in the <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/script-witness/">ScriptWitness</a>.</p>
<p>Taproot also defined the encoding scheme for Schnorr public keys and signatures, making them shorter than their ECDSA counterparts, providing additional fee savings.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-benefits">Privacy Benefits</h3>
<p>The privacy implications of Taproot are perhaps the most important part of the upgrade. By introducing Schnorr signatures and key aggregation, multisignature contracts no longer look different from single signature contracts, providing privacy to all Taproot users.</p>
<div>

  

  
  <p><img src="https://river.com/learn/images/icons/lightbulb.svg" alt="Key Fact: Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels."></p><p>
    Since the Lightning Network relies on 2-of-2 multisig, Taproot makes it impossible to discern which transactions create Lightning channels.
  </p>
  
</div>
<p>Taproot also introduces significant privacy benefits through the integration of MAST. As discussed above, Taproot allows bitcoin to be locked to many scripts at once. However, when spending bitcoin from a Taproot output, the spender need not reveal every possible script that could have unlocked the bitcoin; only the script which they actually used. In the majority of cases, Taproot users will likely use the pay-to-public-key option, allowing them to keep any backup options they might have planned private.</p>
<h3 id="security-upgrades">Security Upgrades</h3>
<p>On a technical, theoretical level, Schnorr signatures are considered more secure than ECDSA signatures because Schnorr signatures are provably secure using fewer assumptions. Like all elliptic curve cryptography schemes, both ECDSA and Schnorr rely on the assumption that the Discrete Logarithm Problem is hard. However, ECDSA relies on additional assumptions in order to guarantee its security. Nonetheless, there have been no examples of ECDSA being systematically compromised during Bitcoin’s existence.</p>
<p>Schnorr signatures also eliminate any signature <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/m/malleability/">malleability</a> that might have been present in ECDSA signatures. While transaction malleability was solved by the SegWit upgrade, malleability of signatures persisted as a feature of ECDSA.</p>
<h2 id="taproot-activation">Taproot Activation</h2>
<p>As of now, Taproot is still a proposed upgrade, and has not yet been activated on the Bitcoin network. When an upgrade to Bitcoin is proposed, it is first discussed by the developer community. Once the proposal is formalized, it is assigned a BIP number. After the code is written, reviewed, tested, and merged, Bitcoin node operators must decide how and when to activate the upgrade.</p>
<p>The Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript upgrades were given BIP 340, 341, and 342 in January of 2020, and have been under discussion and development since. In late 2020, the code implementation for all three upgrades was completed, tested, reviewed, and merged to Bitcoin Core.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, all of the necessary code exists to implement Taproot on an up-to-date Bitcoin node. Now, the community must decide on whether and how to activate Taproot and start enforcing the new consensus rules. There are several methods for activating upgrades to Bitcoin, so the community must first select a path and then execute it.</p>
<h3 id="bitcoin-activation-paths">Bitcoin Activation Paths</h3>
<p>BIP 8 and BIP 9 define two popular methods for activating upgrades. Both processes begin by surveying Bitcoin miners for support. If an overwhelming majority of miners signal their support through messages in the blocks they mine, the upgrade is activated. The difference between BIP 8 and BIP 9 arises if miner support is insufficient. In that case, BIP 9 specifies that the upgrade should not take place, while BIP 8 specifies that the upgrade should be activated after a delay period.</p>
<p>Variants of these two proposals have been put forward in the context of Taproot activation. However, the Bitcoin community has overwhelmingly supported Taproot, and very little criticism has been raised. Thus, the specific activation path is likely insignificant.</p>

With the rank of captain, he commanded&nbsp;the Animation Department of the Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit.</p>  <p>There, he&nbsp;wrote propaganda and military training films including&nbsp;<em>Design for Death, </em>which won an Academy Award,<em>&nbsp;</em>and the animated&nbsp;<em>Private Snafu&nbsp;</em>series, which starred Mel Blanc.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/It3Bgm59mT0" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Seuss's political themes also stretched into his post-war children's books. Minear points out the clear references to Japan in&nbsp;<em>Horton Hears a Who,&nbsp;</em>which was published after Seuss&nbsp;visited Japan in 1953.</p>  <p>"[The passage] 'A person's a person no matter how small'" was "clearly a reference to Japan," he explained.</p>  <p>"And, there's a [vulture]&nbsp;named Vlad Vladikoff [who represents]&nbsp;the Russians, and&nbsp;their monkeys, presumably representing Red China."</p>  <p>He also mentions&nbsp;Yertle the Turtle,&nbsp;who initially "had a Hitler moustache," and the Sneetches from&nbsp;<em>The Sneetches and Other Stories</em>, who are a commentary on antisemitism due to the stars on some of their bellies.</p>  <p>Seuss included these themes in his books because he believed that children's literature was an extension of satire.</p>  <p>"Children's literature as I write it and as I see it is satire to a great extent – satirizing the mores and the habits of the world," <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190301-the-surprisingly-radical-politics-of-dr-seuss">he said.</a></p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Mouhamad Rachini.&nbsp;To hear more from Richard Minear,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/current-affairs-information/day-6/" target="_blank">download our podcast</a>&nbsp;or click Listen above.</em></p>  <p><em>You can access all of Dr. Seuss's political cartoons by&nbsp;visiting <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/speccoll/dswenttowar/index.html#intro">UC San Diego's Special Collections &amp; Archives website</a>.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been about 5500 years since the wheel, one of the most genuine engineering wonders, was invented. The paper is about 2200 years old. The electricity is about 140, transistors reflect 100 years. Only 60 years have passed since the years when software engineering in its own form was known as engineering. Computer scientist and engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)" target="_blank">Margaret Hamilton</a> used the term “Software Engineering” for the first time while building navigation systems for Apollo missions. First master’s degree program in computer engineering at Seattle University took place in 1979 and the ADA Programming Language first appeared in 1980. The Rochester Institute of Technology opened its first bachelor’s degree programme in software development in 1996. The IEEE version of <a href="https://cs.fit.edu/~kgallagher/Schtick/Serious/SWEBOKv3.pdf" target="_blank">“Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)”</a> was published in the same year, 1996.</p><p>When compared to other engineering branches of human culture, computer engineering is a very young discipline. Yet, in history, no other engineering division has evolved so rapidly including the subjects it affected. Engineering devices like sonar, magnetic navigation, photoreceptors have benefited positively from this discipline. The predictability of the world of the other branches was what distinguished software engineering from other engineering branches. Software engineering continued to evolve as a discipline that has to be applied to a world where the laws of physics have changed weekly.</p><p>The only resource I had for the integration of a security dongle for a distribution business was the dongle manufacturer’s user manual at my desk and an email address to contact them when needed. It was a great experience for me to develop this application, because I would be able to transfer this knowledge that I have learned to my colleagues, or to share with other engineers that need it. And that information was of great importance. But now, the platforms like Google and StackOverflow etc simplified things with copy and paste which we do a lot. Now we don’t need to explicitly code algorithms that include calculus, trigonometry, and differential equations. We ought to be more relaxed, maybe. We couldn’t relax, though. Because the challenges faced by current software engineers have become more complicated and demands have risen for an average software engineer. They need to know the topics such as “Cross Platform”, “Asynchronous method”, “Security”, “DevOps”, “Distributed Systems”, “Asynchronous Process”, “Data Processing”, “Microservice Architectures”, “Domain Driven Development”, “Reactive Programming”, “Test Driven Development”, “Test/Data-intensive Development Environments”, “Containers”, “Orchestration Tools” and even more. Products can now be built to be open to millions, not as before, to a small number of consumers. An engineer who has no knowledge of TCP/IP literally writes a back-end service that runs on the Microservice Architecture on a DevOps-supported project without being aware of the cloud systems, is now a market-wide non-preferred engineer. They can save the day, but it won’t take long.</p><p>Years ago, I recall when using Kylix in an ERP development team for a company, I wrote an updater to get the final version of the executable file for the client from the internal network each time the application is started. It was so unusual and exceptional even for an engineer to be online all the time. The offline use of software and offline individuals are extraordinary and exceptional today.</p><p>Developing a new programming language, having knowledge about PL paradigms, writing a compiler or an interpreter were very idealist and romantic endeavours. The people who did these were the heroes of the academic world and they were the people of distinction. However, now, this situation can sometimes even be a weekend hobby of a young developer. There are dozens of new programming languages coming to the market every year, and some have set themselves up for learning a new programming language every year. Things are changing constantly, often unpredictably.</p><p>Each computer engineer has his/her own reason to choose this career. Some have made this decision according to the blowing wind, others have lost themselves in the magic of computers from a very young age, and some have believed they were just going to earn some money or status. There are also those who choose this career, either with the pressure or encouragement from their families, or temptation to choose the most difficult departments of college to join.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you have taken steps in this engineering discipline in some way, and you want to make yourself someone people always want to cooperate with, you have to be aware that it is critical to react quickly to uncertainty. And I strongly believe that you have to feel the pressure first in order to succeed.</p><p>In order to remain valuable in the industry for a long time, without compromising, it is important to aim at grasping certain engineering concepts. Here are some highlights that changed and not changed from these engineering notions which can make you important today:</p><h4 id="things-that-changed">Things that changed</h4><hr><h5 id="time-optimisation">Time Optimisation</h5><p>The paradigms are evolving so rapidly. Improving your ability to recognise what one needs to be specialised in is important. For example, recognising that knowledge of distributed VCS systems is now a must, and being competent and adequate about it, but determining if Git is the instrument that is supposed to be chosen “today”. I put “Time Optimisation” at the beginning of the list, because distinguishing important from unimportant and deciding how to spend your time are the most significant skills in the industry today. It’s a remarkable subject to be able to operate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Pareto Principle</a> effectively.</p><h5 id="deep-focus">Deep Focus</h5><p>It takes deep work and focus to be able to see a complicated system or a story in terms of simple parts or to make them simple. As technology progresses, anyone who does not develop this skill will probably be left behind. Staying in deep focus amongst distractions like mobile notifications, funny YouTube videos and WhatsApp messages, will be the one of the most distinguishing soft skills in the years to come.</p><h5 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h5><p>Although experience is even more relevant at times when access to information was difficult, now, at t=0, an engineer can reach any technological or architectural information easily. Just because some developers have stored this historical information (or a boutique knowledge) in a custom knowledge hierarchy, companies do not have to bear their bad personalities. Software engineers with zero social skills are going extinct. Engineers, who are cocky and whose communication skills are not developed, are not preferred by companies regardless of their technical level.</p><h5 id="knowledge-of-upcoming-technologies">Knowledge of upcoming technologies</h5><p>I’m talking about the people who try and put aside new technology/libraries/tools and move on. Trying <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/736475" target="_blank">Alpha Preview/CTP/Beta</a> and the latest technologies you see coming up, libraries, tools, devices and reading some articles/manuals makes you much more efficient, desirable, searched and valuable now compared to the old days.</p><h4 id="things-that-didnt-changed">Things that didn’t changed</h4><hr><h5 id="continuous-and-fast-learning">Continuous and Fast Learning</h5><p>Challenges are very volatile and something new can come up at any time, unpredictably. Learning about something often implies expense, so it’s better to move early in order to break through the learning curve. Remember: “The more you know, the more advantages and differences you get.” Don’t say “I’ll learn it when the time comes.” It is imperative to attend conferences, monitor hot topics in universities, to join the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank">IEEE</a> and/or <a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a>, to become active and to expand the information network. It is necessary to review papers and be active in local organisations. There are engineers who instinctively do it right. But being able to express the theoretical context is also important.</p><p>In every software engineer’s reading list, these books should also be included:</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670" target="_blank">Code Complete</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/" target="_blank">Clean Code</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612/" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0134757599/" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113" target="_blank">Peopleware</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/" target="_blank">Mythical Man Month</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Computer-Science/dp/3030542556" target="_blank">Algorithm Design Manual</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Pearls-Joe-Bentley/dp/8177588583" target="_blank">Programming Pearls</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Electrical-Engineering/dp/0262510871/" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></p><h5 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h5><p>It is also a challenge to go to the root cause and behind the scenes to grasp languages, libraries and paradigms. You have to understand evolution and the history. For instance: Why does React.js have such popularity? To understand this, the individual must first understand the history and evolution of Javascript, how DOM works, and how DOM manipulation makes sense and why it is so common. The chronological cause and effect relationship helps to better understand the technology in question, as well as to understand whether to spend time in that technology or not. <strong>So, it is not important to use them, what is really important is to know what they are good for.</strong></p><h5 id="fundamental-principles-and-context">Fundamental Principles and Context</h5><p>It is critical to internalise the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, General Principles (KISS, DRY, GP etc.), Modularisation Principles (Model Principle, Information Expert etc) and more (from <a href="https://github.com/HugoMatilla/The-Pragmatic-Programmer" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer Principles</a>). One has to be aware of data structures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff" target="_blank">space and time trade-off</a>s. It is not only important to know the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-vs-array/" target="_blank">difference between Arrays and LinkedList</a>, but to explain the implementation of hash tables and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4980757/how-do-hashtables-deal-with-collisions" target="_blank">handle collisions</a>. One needs to be familiar with the entire <strong>programming stack</strong>, hardware (CPU + memory + cache + interrupts + microcode), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code" target="_blank">binary code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank">compiler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" target="_blank">interpretation</a>, <a href="https://erkut.me/%7B:target=%22_blank%22%7D" target="_blank">garbage collection</a>, problems such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap" target="_blank">heap - stack</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address" target="_blank">memory addressing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)" target="_blank">multi-threading</a>, concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)" target="_blank">synchronisation</a>. It also seems that knowledge of the network protocols, automated/functional/load and UI tests will remain critical and necessary to be a successful and wanted engineer for a long time in the industry.</p><h5 id="failure">Failure</h5><p>And learning how to cope with failure. (If you’ve never failed, you haven’t really tried.) Personally, however, I believe that not all mistakes can be equally forgiven. Lessons learned should be interpreted emotionally-free, and then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>The</span> ever-increasing reliance on touch screens in cars is a controversial topic. With each new product release, the comment sections of articles and youtube videos are filled with negative remarks. Yet, carmakers are totally committed to the race of creating ever-bigger screens. If public opinion is so against touch interfaces in cars, why do car companies use them? I dove into this topic and confirmed my hypothesis: touch screens are not the problem per se, but car companies' design execution is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Touch screens in cars are not new. In fact, the first production car fitted with a touch screen was the 1986 Buick Riviera.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CRT touch display was not that bad, but it took some decades before touch screens were good enough to be widely adopted in cars. After Tesla launched the Model S with its 17" touch screen, carmakers have been eager to design increasingly bigger touch screens. Today, it is an exception if a car is not fitted with one. There are many reasons why this is happening. To dive into those, we first have to define the different types of interactions that occur while driving and how they evolved over time.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Classifying the Interactions</h2>
<p>Aside from the essential driving controls, like steering and braking, I split the interactions into three groups.
The first set is the primary interactions. They include all the functions that are directly related to driving and safety. Examples are monitoring the speed, turning on the indicators, and operating the windscreen wipers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secondary interactions are actions that occur frequently but take little time to accomplish. These can be changing the music volume, changing cabin temperature, or turning on the airconditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tertiary interactions are the opposite of the secondary ones. They are infrequent but require a high cognitive load and take longer to accomplish. Examples are filling in a destination in the navigation system or changing personal settings in the car.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of the Interactions</h2>
<p>Over time, these sets of interactions have evolved in mostly the same way. The interior of the Volkswagen Golf is an excellent demonstrator. The first generation Volkswagen Golf has a simple interior. The primary actions are limited to two gauges, some buttons, and a stalk for the indicators. The same goes for the secondary settings, consisting of three sliders to control the temperature and some volume controls. The only tertiary interaction is to find and set a radio channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, you can clearly see the impact of innovation on the interactions. With each generation, more features are added to the interior.</p>

</video> 
<p>All three sets of interactions increase in quantity, even the primary ones. In the Golf, for example, instead of some basic gauges and controls, the latest generation's primary interactions now also include adaptive cruise control, speed limit warnings, and a range of other safety systems. Even something as simple as turning on the windscreen wipers or lights has increased in complexity with different modes, sensors, and settings.&nbsp;</p>

  </figure>
<p>Similarly, the secondary controls include countless different ways to set the right cabin temperature. There are buttons for heated seats and windows, airconditioning, individual climate control, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the real visible change is an exponential increase in tertiary interactions. Whereas in the first generation Golf, you can only choose a radio station, today there is an endless list of radio channels, streaming services, and podcast platforms. And that is just the media. Almost all cars come with navigation systems, phone connections, and internet-connected apps. All of these can be set up and configured to fit your personal taste. For example, you can choose the exact color of the interior lights, how heavy the steering should be, and which information should be shown in the cluster display.</p>
<p>Initially, all these interactions were controlled via indirect, physical controls. But over time, with each generation, the display grows in size, and the number of physical controls decreases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest generation Golf is another important step because even the secondary interactions are not moved to the touch interface. Most of the physical buttons that remain are the ones that are legally required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2001, BMW launched iDrive, one of the first in-vehicle infotainment systems. It was designed around indirect interactions via a controller close to the gear lever. At the time, it was a good balance between available technology, cost, and usability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over time, just like most in-car infotainment systems, BMW adjusted iDrive for use with touch interaction as well. Why did they decide to include touch interaction in the later version?</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>A lot of it has to do with the increasing complexity of tertiary interactions. As the number of these interactions increases with each generation, indirect controls seem to perform worse than touch interaction, especially in two areas: task completion time and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research has shown that tertiary tasks are performed significantly faster via touch interactions when compared to indirect controls <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. Even compared to other possible interaction techniques like gesture interaction and voice interaction, touch interaction performs equal, if not better <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Naturally, task completion time is only one way to measure the success of an interaction model. Touch screens score differently when it comes to visual attention, lane deviation, reaction time, and others. Carmakers have to weigh the time it takes to complete the tasks versus the gravity of the distraction. In a lot of scenarios, touch interactions are the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second solid argument is the adoption rate of touch interfaces. Once drivers enter their cars, their focus is on driving and not on learning a new system. So one way to decrease driver distraction is to make the interaction as close to other familiar digital products as possible. As such, touch screens are preferred over indirect controls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>The next reason why car makers use touch screens has to do with decluttering. It is a term that is often heard in design departments. It means to reduce the visual overload or perceived complexity of the interior. Getting into a car and seeing a dashboard full of buttons gives a busy, overwhelming look. Instead, a calm-looking interior with few buttons has a positive impact on comfort and perceived quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, many customers relate a big touch screen to a technologically advanced car. As an interior designer, you don't want your car to be perceived as old-fashioned so fitting a giant screen shows your brand is futuristic.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Compared to a dashboard full of different buttons, knobs, and screens, a single touch screen is a much more straightforward part to design, spec, and maintain. Therefore, carmakers may prefer to fit a standardized touch screen instead of a range of custom buttons and knobs because of the development cost.&nbsp;
Another advantage is the possibility to modernize the interior of the car by updating the UI design. Digital design trends move much faster than interior design trends. Tesla has shown that updating the interface of the Model S helps to delay an expensive redesign or new model introduction because the car looks less outdated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Design-wise, the main arguments in favor of touch screens are task completion time and adoption. But there are plenty of ergonomic downsides.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>In mobile environments, like cars, the users' primary focus is on controlling the vehicle. So touch interfaces not only have to be usable and accessible, but they also have to ensure road safety. As discussed before, even though task completion time is the fastest with touch interaction, there are other driver distraction measures where touch interaction is not the preferred method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those is visual attention. When interacting with a touch screen, drivers need to move their visual attention from the road to the screen to find the object they want to select. Furthermore, they have to coordinate their finger to that object without any tactile objects guiding it. With physical controls, much less visual attention is needed to perform the interaction, leading to less distraction <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.
What is the impact of this difference in visual attention between touch controls and indirect controls? Experiments have shown that reaction times are slower, and there is a higher variance in driving behavior like lane departure and maintaining speed <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are the lack of haptic feedback when selecting an object and the display's placement, which is a trade-off between readability and reachability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to consider that there is no perfect solution for an interaction model of tertiary interactions that is easy to operate and not distracting. Carmakers should choose the 'least bad' solution in this case and design around its shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When weighing the positives with the drawbacks of touch screens, they are the right solution for tertiary interactions in most cases if they are optimized for task completion time <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>. The problem, though, is that currently, few of the interfaces are. This has much to do with the design choices of car companies.</p>

  <p>This post is a PSA on the somewhat unintuitive way <code>Field.choices</code> works in Django.</p>

<p>Take this Django model definition:</p>

<p>If we open up a shell to manipulate them, we can easily create a <code>Book</code> with a given status choice:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>$</span> <span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell</span>  <span># with ipython installed

<p>The <code>choices</code> list constrains the value of <code>status</code> during <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/instances/#validating-objects">model validation</a> in Python:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span> <span>=</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<p>This is great for <code>ModelForm</code>s and other cases using validation.
Users can’t select invalid choices and get messaging about what’s wrong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s still easy for us, as developers, to write this invalid data to the database:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]:</span> <span>book</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Woops!</strong></p>

<p>It’s also possible to update <em>all</em> our instances to an invalid status in one line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>In</span> <span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>Book</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>=</span><span>'republished'</span><span>)</span>
<span>Out</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, what gives?
Why does Django let us declare the set of <code>choices</code> we want the field to take, but then let us easily circumvent that?</p>

<p>Well, Django’s model validation is designed mostly for forms.
It trusts that other code paths in your application “know what they’re doing.”</p>

<p>If we want to prevent this, the most general solution is to get the database itself to reject bad data.
Not only will this make your Django code more robust, but any other applications using the database will use the constraints too.</p>

<p>We can add such constraints using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/constraints/#checkconstraint"><code>CheckConstraint</code> class</a>, added in Django 2.2.
For our model, we need define and name a single filter <code>CheckConstraint</code>, in <code>Meta.constraints</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Book</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>}</span><span> - </span><span>{</span><span>Status</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>constraints</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CheckConstraint</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>

            <span>)</span>
        <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>Q</code> object represents a single expression we’d pass into <code>Model.objects.filter()</code>.
Constraints can have any amount of logic on the fields in the current model.
This includes all kinds of lookups, comparisons between fields, and database functions.</p>

<p>Running <code>makemigrations</code>, we get a migration that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>migrations</span><span>,</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"%(app_label)s_%(class)s_status_valid"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to apply this while the database contains invalid data, it will fail:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core

    return Database.Cursor.execute(self, query, params)
django.db.utils.IntegrityError: CHECK constraint failed: status_valid</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we clean that data up manually and try again, it will pass:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>python manage.py migrate
<span>Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: core

<p>From that point on, the database won’t allow us to insert invalid rows, or update the valid rows to be invalid:</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>Currently Django doesn’t have a way of showing these <code>IntegrityError</code>s to users in model validation.
Nothing will catch and turn them into <code>ValidationError</code>s which can carry user-facing messages.
As per the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general constraints are not checked during <code>full_clean()</code>, and do not raise <code>ValidationError</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30581">open ticket #30581</a> to improve this.</p>

<p>In our case, since we are still using <code>choices</code>, this is okay.
Validation already won’t allow users to select invalid statuses.</p>

<p>For more complex constraints, we might want to duplicate the logic in Python with a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/">custom validator</a>.</p>

<p>Check constraints are really neat.
Having the data constrained at the lowest level possible gives us the strongest guarantees of its quality.</p>

<p>I hope this post helps you consider using them,</p>

              <p>Dr. Laurent Michel is a FusionAuth community member and product owner at Softozor. He chatted with us over email about how he and his team are using FusionAuth to meet their auth needs.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Tell me a bit about your work as a developer, software architect and product owner as well as what softozor does.</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Softozor is a very little company made up by me, my brother and a few friends. Currently, we work together in our free time. We are mostly physicists and mathematicians. My brother and I work in software development companies. Our friends are teachers. One of the goals of the Softozor company is to produce educational video games. In order to achieve that goal, we need money, which we are trying to earn with software development projects. Currently, we are developing an ecommerce platform helping craftsmen to sell their products and make them visible in the regions they are living in. A craftsman can be a farmer, a caterer, a baker, a butcher, etc.</p>

<p>I am the company’s official leader. I energize the roles of developer, architect, and product owner. I am the only one team member with the product owner role. The roles of developer and architect are taken by other members of the team. Every architectural decision is discussed in the team so that we get as much insight as possible into the possible problems that we might face during the development. This way we also spread the knowledge of everyone across the whole team.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I essentially develop in C++, C# (.Net / WPF), javascript (VueJs), and python (mainly to write acceptance tests).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use [FusionAuth].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Is the craftsman site live? Can you share the URL?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Yes, the <a href="https://www.ameising.ch/">craftsman site is live</a>, in a reduced form. In the near future, it will show our customers all the shops we are managing. Currently, no shop is shown yet but they will soon pop on the map that we see on the homepage. The platform is not a traditional e-shop. It manages multiple e-shops where each e-shop has multiple tenants. What you see today is just kind of our crowd-funding: we sell baskets of vegetables, fruits, bread, etc. Also, the project you see on that URL targets Switzerland.</p>

<p>The codebase we’ve come up with, however, will be used to produce other e-shopping solutions, not necessarily located in Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use FusionAuth? OAuth? User management? Social sign-on? Something else?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> The development of our platform is proceeding slowly. We integrated FusionAuth last year to the platform’s admin panel. It is planned to be integrated to the e-shop as well, but that is not a priority. We use FusionAuth for user management. It produces JWTs for us which are then consumed by our hasura API. It is very important to us that FusionAuth provides permission management features. Also JWT lambdas are critical for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] documentation is outstanding…</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you use the lambdas? Is it to inject custom permissions (admin, seller, buyer) or for some other use?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  In order to be able to issue requests to our hasura API, it is sometimes necessary to have a JWT. JWTs that are compatible with hasura need special data containing the user’s allowed roles and id, among other things. Here’s a sample populate function that we use in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>populate</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>registration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>jwt</span><span>[</span><span>'</span><span>https://hasura.io/jwt/claims</span><span>'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-allowed-roles</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-default-role</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span>
    <span>'</span><span>x-hasura-user-id</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our software, JWTs are used on the admin frontend, where the craftsmen can define their inventory, shop managers can monitor sellings, etc. On the shop itself, we are not using JWTs yet, because we aren’t supporting customer accounts yet, which would be the only use case where JWTs would be useful. Indeed, the whole shopping frontend is generated following the JAMStack philosophy. Therefore, the sensitive information is gathered from the hasura API with special rights on our CI/CD server and injected into the shop frontend whenever necessary. That leaves users of that frontend with (almost) no way to hack into our API.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> What problems did we solve for you? And how were you solving them before FusionAuth?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> You solve the permission management problem. You provide us with a reliable way to generate JWTs that are compatible with hasura. It’s the first time where we had to integrate an authorization and authentication system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both [the .NET and python SDKs] saved us a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Why did you choose FusionAuth over the competition?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We evaluated a few options: keycloak, keratin/authn, and FusionAuth. The ease of installation and the set of features were the most decisive motivations to use your software. Its documentation is outstanding, and that also helped a lot in choosing FusionAuth.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How much time and money would you say FusionAuth has saved you?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> It saved a lot of time. If we agree that time is money, then it saved us a lot of money too. We could’ve implemented a reduced set of the features provided by FusionAuth, but that would’ve taken a lot of time. We could’ve chosen another solution other than FusionAuth and implemented the missing features, but again that would’ve been a killer. I’d say it saved us something like one man-year of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> How do you run FusionAuth (k8s, standalone tomcat server, behind a proxy, etc)?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong> We run FusionAuth on a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. It is completely hidden behind our hasura api. We write hasura actions that interact with FusionAuth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d say it saved us something like one man-year of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Can you tell me a bit more about the hasura actions?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  Our system is based on the 3-factor app pattern: realtime graphql API, reliable eventing, and async serverless. That is out-of-the-box hasura behavior.</p>

<p>When relevant data is changed in our database, some events are triggered, which results in calling some serverless functions (e.g. in our system we use OpenFaaS). In addition to that, we can complete the GraphQL API automatically generated by hasura with additional queries / mutations, which are known as “hasura actions”. For example, the automatically generated API does not come out with a login mutation. Either you route the login request from your frontend to FusionAuth directly or you decide that you have a central API over which everything should go.</p>

<p>We chose the latter variant, as we find it both clearer and cleaner. In that case, we had to define a hasura login action. That amounts to telling hasura what the mutation looks like: what name, what input, what output, and then link that mutation with a serverless function. In that context, we are very happy to use the .Net SDK provided by FusionAuth! It has all the necessary REST client wrappers necessary for us to perform the operations we need on FusionAuth.</p>

<p>We are also very happy to use the python SDK in our acceptance tests. We use it to fill up the users database with the necessary credentials to then interact with our system under test.</p>

<p>Both SDKs saved us a lot of time.</p>

<p><strong>Dan:</strong> Any general feedback/areas to improve?</p>

<p><strong>Laurent:</strong>  I think it would be great if FusionAuth could produce <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/paseto">Pasetos</a>. I know everyone on the web uses JWTs, but those are very easy to handle in an insecure way. They are insecure by default, whereas Pasetos are secure by default. <em>[Ed note: We have an open feature request for <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/773">paseto support</a>.]</em></p>

<p>For our use-cases with hasura, it would not bring anything right now (see <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/3205">this issue</a>) but I can imagine that they could be useful in the near future.</p>

                <h3>Git in 10 commands to do 99% of gitting and keeping out of trouble</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>Git is hard, probably harder than it needs to be but I have been using it for about 5 years and have a workflow that works for me. I use git from a command line and have learnt how to use these ten commands. If I need to deal with a merge conflict, I use VS Code and the gitlens extension. If I need to do anything else then I probably copy out the files I want to keep, reset my local repo or delete it and clone a new repo then paste back the files I want to include in the change.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-new-piece-of-work">Starting a new piece of work</h2>
<p>This requires creating a new branch. We want to checkout master, make sure it is up to date and then create a new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git pull
</code></pre>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><p>Now, if the checkout or the pull fail then I will likely do a git stash to throw away any local changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
</code></pre><p>If I still can't pull from master it is probably because I have commits that I don't want on the remote master. I will probably clone a new version of the repo:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf repo (or mv repo oldrepo)
</code></pre><p>then</p>
<pre><code>git clone git://url
</code></pre><p>then I will create the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b new_branch_name
</code></pre><h2 id="committing-work">Committing Work</h2>
<p>I have done my work and want to commit it, either to then push to the remote repo or to add more work later on.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
</code></pre><p>I very rarely want to only add a subset of files, if I do then I will put the full path to the file to add:</p>
<pre><code>git add ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>Once I have added the files I will check what state I am in:</p>
<pre><code>git status
</code></pre><p>What I am looking for is a) I have remembered to checkout a branch and am not working on master and b) that I have got the files ready to commit that I expect.</p>
<p>If I forgot to create a branch, then I will stash everything, checkout the new branch then pop the changes into the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>git stash --include-untracked
git pull
git checkout -b new_branch_name
git stash pop
</code></pre><p>&nbsp;
I realise you could just do a <code>git checkout -b</code> but I like to keep it simple and keep my branch up to date.</p>
<p>If I have the correct files in my list of staged files then I will commit the files:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "message"
</code></pre><p>If there are files that I don't want to check it, maybe I fat fingered a change to a file I didn't want I will either fix it up manually or checkout the original version of the file:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -- ./folder/folder/folder/file.ext
</code></pre><p>and then I will commit the files I do want.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-my-changes">Sharing my changes</h2>
<p>When I am ready to push my changes to the remote repo, I do a git push:</p>
<pre><code>git push
</code></pre><p>This always fails the first time I run it but the output shows the command I do need to run. I copy and paste that output and push my changes.</p>
<h2 id="red-green">Red Green</h2>
<p>From here, if I need to make any changes I go and do that, add the files, commit that changes and push them until I am done. If there have been changes on master I don't have then I will bring them locally:</p>
<pre><code>git pull origin master
</code></pre><p>origin is the name of the remote, if you aren't sure what it is do:</p>
<pre><code>git remote --v
</code></pre><p>If you get a merge conflict then open the directory in VS Code. Make sure you have gitlens installed as an extension in VS Code and then use the file explorer to find the files that are a bluey colour. When you have found the files with a conflict, open them and browse to the sections with the conflicts and VS Code will let you either keep the incoming change (the changes already on master), keep your local changes (the changes you just made) or keep both. VS Code does a pretty good job of merging the files.</p>
<p>Once you have fixed the merges then go back to add, commit, push.</p>
<h2 id="finish">Finish</h2>
<p>Lastly checkout master and pull down the latest changes:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre><p>Then check for any branches that can be deleted and get rid of them. <code>git branch</code> shows all the local branches:</p>
<pre><code>git branch
</code></pre><p>If you no longer need a branch then:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D branch_name
</code></pre><p>and shazam, the branches gone. You are now back at master, ready to start the merry-go-round again.</p>
<p>If you read this, scoffed and went “oh you could have done it like x” well great, I am sure there are loads of efficiencies to make here but this works for me so I am happy with my git choices.</p>
<h3 id="more-help">More Help</h3>
<p>For help with specific scenarios: <a href="https://dangitgit.com/en">https://dangitgit.com/en</a></p>
<p>(and the ten commands to stop you having to count and proove me wrong):</p>
<ul>
<li>git pull</li>
<li>git checkout</li>
<li>git stash</li>
<li>git add</li>
<li>git commit</li>
<li>git branch</li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>git clone</li>
<li>git status</li>
<li>git remote</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Thousands of years ago one of your ancient ancestors was enjoying the spoils of a recent hunting trip when suddenly a saber toothed tiger jumped out of the bush. &nbsp;Your cave man relative had a choice, fight off the tiger or drop the food and run. &nbsp;They ran….and they ran fast. &nbsp;The human brain is an amazing thing, it has evolved over the eons to help us survive. &nbsp;Most of those eons involved surviving physical threats where flight over fight was often the smart choice.</p>
<p>The financial “threats” we face in the 21st century are diametrically opposed to the physical threats of ancient times. &nbsp;Stock market crashes, unlike hungry saber toothed tigers, often present opportunities as opposed to imminent death. &nbsp;My very simple example here downplays the complex neurobiology of the human brain that drives us to make poor financial decisions, but the end result is the same:&nbsp; humans are hardwired to be poor investors.</p>

<h2>Brief Review of Financial Neurobiology</h2>
<p>In addition to “fight or flight”, there are a host of other <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rflr.v3.n1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented and studied cognitive psychological human tendencies</a> that impede our ability to be rational investors.&nbsp; Here is a high level list provided by the CFA Institute.</p>
<p>•Overconfidence and overoptimism—investors overestimate their ability and the accuracy of the information they have.</p>
<p>• Representativeness—investors assess situations based on superficial characteristics rather than underlying probabilities.</p>
<p>• Conservatism—forecasters cling to prior beliefs in the face of new information.</p>
<p>• Availability bias—investors overstate the probabilities of recently observed or experienced events because the memory is fresh.</p>
<p>• Frame dependence and anchoring—the form of presentation of information can affect the decision made.</p>
<p>• Mental accounting—individuals allocate wealth to separate mental compartments and ignore fungibility and correlation effects.</p>
<p>• Regret aversion—individuals make decisions in a way that allows them to avoid feeling emotional pain in the event of an adverse outcome.</p>
<h2>What is a Pea-brained Human to do?</h2>
<p>I am by no means an expert on all of the ways our brains fail us with our finances.&nbsp; My opinion is that some people are wired well for today’s financial world, these lucky ones are winners of Warren Buffett’s “Ovarian Lottery.”&nbsp; Unfortunately, I believe the vast majority of us are vulnerable to these behavioral traps.&nbsp; But there is hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as species go we as humans are uniquely gifted with intelligence and logic, two tools that we at engineered portfolio believe you can use to combat your cave man brain and become a successful investor.&nbsp; Becoming a successful investor, like most things in life, requires thoughtful planning and hard work.&nbsp; The below suggestions work in tandem with one another, reinforcing each other, you need them all to have a proper mind set to tackle Mr. Market.&nbsp; For those of you who don’t know Mr. Market go read, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507565929&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Intelligent Investor</a>” by Benjamin Graham RIGHT NOW!</p>
<h3>Understand History</h3>
<p>When faced with a major market correction how do you feel?&nbsp; As the panic sets in what are the thoughts going through your brain?&nbsp; What should be going through your brain is that this is normal stock market behavior and you know this because you have studied the history of the stock market!&nbsp; To date, the stock market has always recovered from every down turn, every depression and every panic.&nbsp; Sometimes it rebounds quickly, sometimes it takes decades to come back.&nbsp; But it always has come back.&nbsp; If we are the unlucky generation to see our stock markets completely crumble and be worthless it probably means we are in the midst of some kind of zombie apocalypse so you have bigger things to worry about than your portfolio.&nbsp; In fact your cave man brain might actually be more useful to you in this scenario!</p>
<p>I am not saying blindly buy and hold stocks and white knuckle your way through the ups and downs.&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; But understanding the stock market history will help you both build, adjust and stick to your plan.</p>
<p>Here is some basic history but I strongly urge you to read as much about stock market history as possible to arm yourself with the data you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1287761-how-often-does-s-and-p-500-have-10-percent-and-20-percent-negative-price-moves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The stock market has 10% and 20% corrections VERY often</a>.
<ul>
<li>In the last 30 years 10% corrections have occurred an average of 2.27 times per year</li>
<li>In the last 30 years 20% corrections have occurred an average of 0.73 times per year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stocks can be extremely over valued (optimism) or undervalued (pessimism) and prices tend to revert to a “mean”</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Reading:</p>
<p>William J. Bernstein’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/0071747052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519584544&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=four+pillars+of+investing">The Four Pillars of Investing</a>“.&nbsp; Pillar #2 is the history of investing.&nbsp; It is only about 20 pages, however I recommend reading the entire book.</p>
<p>Benjamin Graham’s ” The Intelligent Investor.”&nbsp; Chapter 3 covers a century of stock market history (up to 1972).&nbsp; I really enjoy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519585168&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+intelligent+investor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Zweig’s offering</a> which has Mr. Graham’s original text alongside some more modern commentary.&nbsp; It really shows the durability of Graham’s teachings.</p>
<h3>Look FORWARD to a Market Crash…..WHAT?!</h3>
<p>I should add a note to that title, look forward to <strong>AND BE PREPARED FOR</strong> a market crash.&nbsp; This might seem a little crazy, but this is the mindset you should have, you want to flip fear on its head.&nbsp; If you are a current purchaser of stocks and if you believe that in the end, the price level of the market ends up where ever it is going to end up, it is generally better for you if stock prices are lower today.&nbsp; This plays into knowing your history.&nbsp; In order to buy into a falling market you have to have confidence that the market will rebound.&nbsp; Also, in order to buy into a market you need money!&nbsp; When you have un-invested cash and you are armed with historical knowledge you start to look forward to when you can deploy that cash….you can’t wait for the market to drop!</p>
<p>I have two pieces of advice here:</p>
<p>#1 – Always have at least 10% of your invest-able assets in non stock assets (bonds, cash, gold etc).&nbsp; Ideally you would have 10% cash ready to deploy in a downturn.&nbsp; You can’t take advantage of a downturn in stocks if you don’t have the resources.</p>
<p>#2 – WARNING:&nbsp; Some people will hate this advice.&nbsp; It is generally a good idea to always have 6 months expenses saved in cash.&nbsp; If you believe your job is safe I recommend putting up to 50% of your cash reserves into the market during a correction.&nbsp; I would recommend putting 20% in after a 10% correction, if the market continues to fall I would put another 30% in after a 20% correction.</p>
<h3>Automate Your Financial Life – Save!</h3>
<p>Whether it is paying bills or saving for retirement I highly recommend automating your financial life.&nbsp; At this point I spend less than 5 minutes a month paying bills or transferring money, it is all automated.&nbsp; Inertia, distraction, fear and sometimes just laziness can get in the way of making smart financial decisions.&nbsp; One of the smartest financial decisions you can make is to SAVE!&nbsp; Don’t tempt fate, automate your savings where you can.&nbsp; This is one of the big benefits of employer 401(k) plans, the money comes out of your paycheck without any work on your part.&nbsp; If you want to fund an IRA, set up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking account, it becomes mindless.&nbsp; I fund my taxable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> account with an automatic $100 transfer every week.&nbsp; If you don’t know what Robinhood is I strongly recommend you check it out as it plays into my next piece of advice, control what you can control.&nbsp; Fee’s are one of the biggest things you can control.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Fees</h3>
<p>I hate fees.&nbsp; This is a little off topic as far as behavioral finance is concerned, but I never want to miss an opportunity to say how much I hate fees!&nbsp; Any rational and logical person should want to reduce their financial fees as much as possible.&nbsp; You will reach your financial goals much sooner if you keep your fees low.&nbsp; Please have a read on the corrosive nature of investment fees in <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/03/11/the-corrosive-nature-of-investment-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another blog I wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; For a taxable stock account check out <a href="https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a>, no costs to buy or sell!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; When buying mutual funds or ETFs never pay more than 0.30%, ideally pay 0.10% or less.&nbsp; I find <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a> consistently offers low cost funds.</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; If your 401(k) plan only has high fee options, get some fellow concerned co-workers together and petition your human resources department to make improvements.&nbsp; They are fiduciaries for you and should be very receptive to your concerns about high fees.</p>
<h3>Control What You Can Control – Asset Allocation</h3>
<p>Again, this plays into understanding history.&nbsp; Asset allocation is the “mix” of different types of investments you hold.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar with asset allocation I suggest you check out this <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/2016/08/01/asset-allocation-and-the-efficient_frontier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>.&nbsp; A proper asset allocation can help behaviorally on a number of fronts.&nbsp; First, a good asset allocation should minimize risk for a given level of return.&nbsp; The less risk you need to take the less likely you are to succumb to your cave man brain.&nbsp; Second, like understanding the market history, understanding the benefits of a good asset allocation will give you confidence and resolve through market turmoil.&nbsp; My partner Steve has done some amazing work on this website on really smart and unique asset allocation.&nbsp; Asset allocation is what an engineered portfolio is all about!</p>
<p>Advice:&nbsp; Read all of <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve’s blogs</a>.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="https://engineeredportfolio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineered portfolios</a> that Steve built.</p>
<h3>Unique Advice – Check Your Accounts at Least Weekly, Ideally Daily</h3>
<p>This is financial blasphemy to many.&nbsp; The current thinking in the world is that since you have these behavioral weaknesses you should compensate for them by avoiding your finances.&nbsp; The thinking is that you will do something stupid if you look at them.&nbsp; I don’t disagree…..assuming that you look at them infrequently and if you only look at them when the financial world seems to be falling apart.&nbsp; This is exactly what happens.&nbsp; People are going through their lives:&nbsp; family, work, friends, vacations etc.&nbsp; They don’t really pay much attention to Wall Street or their investments.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden there is a major …</p></div></div>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

The home is 1900 square feet and took only forty eight hours of print time, over an eight day period. The home was entirely printed and built onsite using less than $6000 in materials. Future print-time is expected to be cut in half on their next projects, due to ARCS enhancements implemented post construction.</p>
<p>ARCS is a patent pending technology that robotically builds foundations, exterior walls, interior walls, utility conduits and more. This digital driven system reduces labor to as little as 3 people, accounting for up to 41% of the total construction of a home. ARCS low-power consumption technology allows homes and buildings to be built using far less energy than needed in traditional construction methods, creating an environmentally friendly impact.</p>
<p>ARCS achieves faster build times by eliminating and consolidating over 20 manual labor intensive processes (siding, framing, sheathing, etc.). This revolutionary technology will be replacing and eliminating more expensive and inferior building materials, causing the printed structures to be stronger and safer. Utilizing concrete will reduce the cost by at least 30%, as well as making the structure more fire resistant than traditional methods. This home will have the strength to last into the next century.</p>
<p>SQ4D’s completion of the world’s largest 3D printed home is a game changer. “Changing the way the world is built” is more than just the company’s tagline; it is a reality.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-zyrianov-8a7ab34/">Sergey Zyrianov</a> - Tech Lead, 2021-02-28</p>
<p>A timer is a cornerstone of any software that communicates over the network. There are plenty of implementations
that provide a timer facility. Most of them are in memory and will lose scheduled timers should the application crash.
In this blog we discuss durable Kafka timers that do not depend on in memory state. By design
we shall assume 1 second resolution of these timers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before taking on timers let’s cover some Kafka basics.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-concepts">Kafka concepts</h2>
<p>There are a few Kafka concepts in play to simulate timers - Kafka topic, Kafka stream, Kafka streams library.
Where <em>topic</em> is append only log of events, <em>stream</em> is a cache of N most recent events on the <em>topic</em>, 
and the <em>streams library</em> is a software library implementing the concept of the <em>stream</em>.</p>

<p>A kafka topic resides inside the Kafka servers, but Kafka streams library keeps track of a topic’s most recent
events on the application side - the stream. The stream is a key/value cache with random read access unlike
append only topic log. Key/value cache is not the only thing the library provides. It can also join
the streams. When an event and its key appear on a stream, the library looks up the same key in the other streams participating in the join. 
It is using key/value cache associated with each stream and gives the result to the application. 
The result will have the present event enriched with the matched past events from the joined streams.
Joining two streams will yield the timer callback. Let’s see how.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Since it is Kafka, timer expiration shall result in an event posted on a topic of user’s choice at the right time.
This event is delayed until due time by joining two streams: <em>oscillator</em> and <em>timer-request</em>. Callback 
event is pushed to <em>timer-request</em> topic with key equal to the expiration timestamp. Oscillator topic
is the clock dial counting seconds since UNIX epoch in real time. At some point it will get to the second
which is equal to the key on <em>timer-request</em> topic, and the join will come up with the callback event.</p>

<p>An excellent summary on “timer wheel” and other timer algorithms can be found in this linux kernel <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/156329/">thread</a>.
Our implementation of timers using Kafka resembles the “timer wheel” algorithm with a bucket on each second to keep callbacks.
<em>Oscillator</em> topic models rotating clock dial, <em>timer-request</em> is bucketing callbacks by the expiration timestamp, and join of these two
contains content of the expired bucket with all the callbacks in it.</p>

<p><img src="https://wgtwo.com/img/blog/kafka-timers/kt.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There are two Kafka applications running together to service these topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oscillator</li>
  <li>Futures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="oscillator">Oscillator</h3>

<p>With the resolution of 1 second oscillator keeps pushing <em>oscillator</em> topic:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>nowSeconds</span> <span>=</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>currentTimeMillis</span><span>()</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000L</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>timestampSeconds</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>nowSeconds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>++</span>
        <span>KafkaProducers</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span>
            <span>"oscillator"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>timestampSeconds</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"1"</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="futures">Futures</h3>

<p>When requesting a timer by pushing <em>timer-request</em> topic, the user provides a callback structure 
used to dispatch timer event:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>message Future {
    string callBackTopic = 1;
    string callBackKey = 2;
    bytes callBack = 3;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Joining two streams on the key equal to the UNIX second will give all expired timers, and
their callback coordinates.</p>

<p>First, setup a join with <em>WINDOW_SIZE</em> large enough to cover the longest timer duration</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>oscillator</span> <span>=</span> <span>builder</span><span>.</span><span>stream</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>"oscillator"</span><span>)</span>

<h3 id="cancelling-a-timer">Cancelling a timer</h3>
<p>There is no way to cancel these timers as events can’t be easily removed from the Kafka stream.
Still, it is possible to ignore timer events by using a token in callback request, and a variable 
in timer receiver state. When scheduling a timer the receiver puts the same token in two places:</p>

<ul>
  <li>callback struct it publishes on the <em>timer-request</em> topic</li>
  <li>internal variable timerToken</li>
</ul>

<p>As timer fires receiver compares value in timerToken and in the callback event. Based on the result it
draws a conclusion if timer is to be ignored or not. All it has to do to cancel a timer is to reset
value in its timerToken variable.</p>

<p>Since normally Kafka does “at least once” delivery it is a good idea to reset the timerToken immediately 
after notification event.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-worry-about">What to worry about</h3>

<p>Kafka streams library is using local disk storage to keep the cache. The storage shall be large enough to host
all timer requests based on the product of <em>timer-request</em> topic retention, callback size and timer scheduling rate.
Thankfully Kafka is well-equipped to deal with this sort of troubles.</p>

<p>Oscillator must keep ticking otherwise timers will stop coming. Make sure to have
metrics/alarms in place to stay on top of Oscillator health. Deploy few of them for redundancy having in 
mind the extra load they will generate on timer users.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many options to export application state to the data tier layer. Timers are often part of that
state. Above we showed how to apply Kafka primitives to achieve a goal of making application “stateless” even
if the state is using timers. It has its costs and benefits.</p>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote><p>One luminary clock against the sky <br> Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p><p><cite>Robert Frost, <em>Acquainted with the Night</em> (1928)</cite></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Time is still the great mystery to us. It is no more than a&nbsp;concept; we don’t know if it even exists…</p><p><cite>Clifford D. Simak, <em>Shake­speare’s Planet</em> (1976)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also time: a&nbsp;repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it doesn’t work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always implies keeping track of time.</p><p>As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a&nbsp;<em>defin­i­tion of time</em>, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to synchro­nizing the state of a&nbsp;global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do you tell the time if clocks can’t be trusted? How do you create the concept of a&nbsp;singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you measure time in a&nbsp;timeless realm? And what is time anyway?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer these questions, we will have to take a&nbsp;closer look at the concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block time — more commonly known as <em>block height</em>. We will explore why the problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why there is no absolute time in a&nbsp;decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” Today, it is again a&nbsp;timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a&nbsp;clock, not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional age. And this clock is Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-things">Keeping Track of Things</h2><blockquote><p>Let the child learn to count things, thus getting the notion of number. These things are, for the purpose of counting, consid­ered alike, and they may be single objects or groups.</p><p><cite>David Eugene Smith, <em>The Teaching of Elemen­tary Mathe­matics</em> (1900)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things: physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts directly, e.g., give someone a&nbsp;sea shell, a&nbsp;coin, or some other tangible <em>thing</em>, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down what happened on a&nbsp;piece of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are a&nbsp;shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock returned home. You can put a&nbsp;collar on each sheep, and as soon as a&nbsp;sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of course, you can also count them and keep a&nbsp;list. However, you will have to make sure to create a&nbsp;new list every time you start counting, and you will also have to make sure not to count a&nbsp;single sheep twice (or not at all).</p><p>Money is essen­tially a&nbsp;tool to keep track of who owes what to whom. Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into two categories: <em>physical</em> artifacts and <em>infor­ma­tional</em> lists. Or, to use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.</p><figure> <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2021-01-14-bitcoin-is-time/ledger-token.jpg"></figure><p>It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first method — a&nbsp;physical token — <em>directly</em> repre­sents the state of things. The second one — a&nbsp;ledger — <em>indirectly</em> reflects the state of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example, tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.</p><p>In the digital realm — no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to convince you of the opposite — we can only use ledgers. It is an <em>infor­ma­tional</em> realm, not a&nbsp;physical one. Even if you call a&nbsp;certain kind of infor­ma­tion a “token,” it is still a&nbsp;malleable piece of infor­ma­tion, written down on a&nbsp;hard drive or some other medium that can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional record.</p><p>The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of the world <em>directly</em>. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to “move” it, you have to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem doesn’t exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can actually move things from A&nbsp;to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn’t have this property. If you want to “move” infor­ma­tion from list A&nbsp;to list B, you have to copy it from A&nbsp;to B. There is no other way.</p><p>Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens are not. I&nbsp;would even argue that “digital token” is a&nbsp;misnomer. A&nbsp;token might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.</p><p>This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to “hand over” infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a&nbsp;digital token like you would pass on a&nbsp;physical one since you can never be sure if the original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens, like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.</p><blockquote><p>… if you have an apple and I&nbsp;have an apple, and we swap apples — we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I&nbsp;have an idea and we swap ideas — we each end up with two ideas.</p><p><cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Physical tokens — what we call physical bearer assets, or “cash” — are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me a&nbsp;coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over. The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.</p><p>While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm — George Parker, a&nbsp;con artist who famously “double-spent” the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks comes to mind — it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with <em>infor­ma­tion,</em> double-spending is an <em>inherent</em> problem. As everyone who ever copied a&nbsp;file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is something that you can copy <em>perfectly</em>, and it is not bound to the medium that hosts it. If you have a&nbsp;digital photo­graph, for example, you can copy it a&nbsp;million times, store some copies on a&nbsp;USB stick, and send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.</p><p>Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There simply is no way to <em>move</em> digital infor­ma­tion from A&nbsp;to B. Infor­ma­tion is always <em>copied</em> from A&nbsp;to B, and if the copying process was successful, the original copy of A&nbsp;is deleted. This is why the double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a&nbsp;central authority, there is no way to move <em>anything</em> from A&nbsp;to B&nbsp;in a&nbsp;trust­less manner. You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A&nbsp;natural side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is <em>impos­sible</em> to tell how many copies are in existence and where these copies might be.</p><p>Because of this, using digital “tokens” as money can not and will never work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to repro­duce as a&nbsp;result of their unique physical construc­tion, this advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm, tokens cannot be trusted. As a&nbsp;result of the nature of infor­ma­tion’s intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not a&nbsp;token but a&nbsp;ledger — which brings us to the problem of time.</p><h2 id="tokens-are-timeless-ledgers-are-not">Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not</h2><blockquote><p>For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</p><p><cite>Paul of Tarsus, <em>Corinthians</em> 4:18b</cite></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a&nbsp;trans­ac­tion does not matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don’t; you can either spend them, or you can’t. The simple act of posses­sion is the only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.</p><p>When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside. Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are <em>in order</em>. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you can’t spend money that you don’t have and you can’t spend money that you have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of a&nbsp;ledger, not physical laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter. Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For example, you can’t simply “make up” a&nbsp;physical gold coin. You have to dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a&nbsp;gold coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and give yourself a&nbsp;couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks, simply add a&nbsp;couple trillion with a&nbsp;few computer keystrokes. (Fancy finan­cial people call this “Rehypoth­e­ca­tion,” “Fractional Reserve Banking,” or …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Networking is a requirement for most modern iOS apps.</p>
<p>Networked apps usually interface with a remote web service that provides data. And often, such a web service is a REST API that returns data in JSON format.</p>
<p>Writing the networking layer of an iOS app, though, is not a simple task. When making asynchronous network calls, you need to combine several features of Swift, SwiftUI, and the Foundation framework. Moreover, many parts of your app’s architecture need to interact, making the task more complicated than it might seem at first.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say: <i>“I need to get some data from a REST API</i>.” But such sentence hides a ton of complexity. Many developers simply put together pieces of networking code they find on Stack Overflow, o use a networking library.</p>
<p>But networking has a lot of hidden pitfalls.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project where strange bugs happened randomly. The app displayed a list of items, and the user could add more. But sometimes, when adding a new item, the app would reply with an alert saying that the object already existed on the server. Since that was a new item, it clearly was not possible. And the problem was even weirder. The alert would not only show once but multiple times.</p>
<p>After a more in-depth investigation, I discovered that the problem was caused by the networking stack of the app, which had the wrong architecture. Network calls and callbacks were handled through notifications, which I usually recommend to avoid. Since there were many listeners for the same notification, network calls for the same item were duplicated. The server then rejected the extra network calls, causing the multiple alerts to appear in the app.</p>
<p>Architecture is a topic I often cover in my articles because this is the vital foundation of every iOS app. Even if you use the iOS SDK correctly <b>if you structure your code in the wrong way you end with all sorts of problems in your app</b>.</p>

<p>Performing network requests in a real SwiftUI app</p>
</div>

<h2>The required steps to perform network requests to a REST API from an iOS app</h2>
<p>Performing network requests in an iOS app does not merely amount to adding some extra code. There are many moving parts you need to understand when connecting to a remote web service in iOS. In this article, we will look at each aspect, one by one.</p>
<p>In summary, these are the steps you need to go through to perform a network request in an iOS app:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the remote web service works</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, there are <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many public APIs</a> on the internet. Each one comes with its implementation and documentation. And, if you work for a company or a client, you might have to interface with a private one. Modern web services often, but not always, are based on the <i>REST architecture</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand how the HTTP protocol works.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>REST APIs are based on the <i>HTTP protocol</i>, which is the communication protocol used by the world wide web. Understanding HTTP means knowing how <i>URLs </i>are structured, what actions you can express using <i>HTTP methods</i>, how you can express <i>parameters</i> in a request, and how to send or receive<i> </i>data.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Get a list of all the URLs to make the requests you need</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every REST API offers a series of URLs to fetch, create, update, and delete data on a server. These are unique to each API. Their structure depends on the choices made by the developers that created the API. If you are lucky,&nbsp;your API of choice&nbsp;<span>comes with proper documentation. Often though, especially when you interface with a private API, you have to talk to the server-side developers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Learn how to use the URL loading system in the iOS SDK</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation">The Foundation framework</a> has a robust networking API that addresses all your networking needs, especially for the HTTP protocol. The workhorse of this API is the <i>URLSession</i> class. On the internet, you can also find alternative networking libraries, which I don’t recommend using.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Perform a network request to get the data you need in your app.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>By putting together the elements I listed above, you can write the code to perform a remote API call and get back some data. Data comes in different formats, like binary data (for media files), JSON, XML, Markdown, HTML, or others.</p>
<p>Before you can use such data in your app, you have to parse it and convert to your model types. Binary data is usually directly convertible into the appropriate media types you find in the iOS SDK. In the case of structured data like JSON, parsing is also quite straightforward. For more complex formats like XML, Markdown, and HTML you might have to write a custom parser.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Handle the asynchronous nature of network calls in Swift.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If making network requests alone was not already hard enough, you have to add to it the fact that you need to run network requests <i>asynchronously</i>.</p>
<p>Network requests are inherently slow since it takes time for a server to respond and to transfer data over the network. That means that networking code needs to run in the background, or your app will become unresponsive for long periods. This has different implications in how you write your Swift code, how you handle callbacks, and how you manage memory.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Finally, use the retrieved data in your app</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also not as straightforward as it sounds. Network requests can fail for many reasons, so you need to handle errors and missing data. You also need to update the UI of your app and show to the user that data is being fetched over the network.</p>
<h2>REST APIs use URLs and the HTTP protocol to identify resources and transfer data</h2>
<p>You access any REST API through the internet. That means that the various resources offered by the API are identified by a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uniform resource locators or URLs</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" alt="the parts composing a URL" width="1251" height="272" srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1251px) 100vw, 1251px" data-srcset="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png 1251w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-300x65.png 300w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-768x167.png 768w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-1024x223.png 1024w, https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL-624x136.png 624w" data-src="https://matteomanferdini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-parts-composing-a-URL.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p>A URL has different components, but in the context of REST APIs, we are usually interested in just three:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The host</b>, which is typically a name (or sometimes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IP address</a>) that identifies the other endpoint (the <i>server</i>) we are going to connect to.</li>
<li><b>A path</b>, which identifies the resource we are looking for.</li>
<li><b>An optional query</b>, where we can add extra parameters to affect the data we get back (filtering, sorting, paging, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>URLs though, are just a part of what you need to understand to communicate with a REST API. The other part is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representational State Transfer architecture or REST</a>.</p>
<p>REST is a type of architecture for web services. But as iOS developers, <b>we don’t care how the entire REST architecture works</b> on the side of the server. All we care about is what we see from an iOS app.</p>
<h2>Making REST API calls using HTTP requests</h2>
<p>REST works over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a>, which was created to transmit web pages over the internet. Simply put, in HTTP, we send requests to a server, which sends back responses.</p>
<p>An <i>HTTP request</i> usually contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a URL</b> identifying the resource we want;</li>
<li><b>an HTTP method</b> that states the action we want to perform;</li>
<li><b>optional parameters</b> for the server in the form of HTTP headers;</li>
<li><b>some optional data</b> we might want to send to the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most REST APIs use only a subset of HTTP methods to express which actions you can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-604185078847f248635988"><span><span>GET</span></span></span>, to fetch a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6041850788482293661313"><span><span>POST</span></span></span>, to create or update a resource</li>
<li>
			<span id="crayon-6041850788485477509267"><span><span>DELETE</span></span></span>, to delete a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Some APIs can also use the 
			<span id="crayon-6041850788488493146136"><span><span>HEAD</span></span></span>, 
			<span id="crayon-604185078848a414013377"><span><span>PUT</span></span></span> or 
			<span id="crayon-604185078848d640164418"><span><span>PATCH</span></span></span> methods, although it depends on the skills of the API developer. How these work depends on the specific API you are using, so you always have to check the documentation to see if they are available and what they do.</p>
<p>When it comes to parameters, you might have noticed we have two options: either the query string in the URL or the HTTP headers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So which one should you use?</p>
<p>Details usually depend on the API, but, in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query string is for parameters related to the resource you are accessing.</li>
<li>The HTTP headers are for parameters related to the request itself, for example, authentication headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in the optional data section of a request, we put the data we want to send to the API when we are creating or modifying a resource. If you are simply fetching a resource, you don’t need to add any data to your request. In fact, the HTTP specification states that a server can reject a 
			<span id="crayon-6041850788490986657371"><span><span>GET</span></span></span> request that contains data.</p>
<h2>Most REST APIs return structured JSON and binary data</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, in HTTP, you make requests, and the server replies with responses. An HTTP response usually carries:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a status code</b>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a number</a> that tells you if your call was ok or if there was some error;</li>
<li><b>some HTTP headers</b> specifying extra information about the response;</li>
<li><b>data</b>, if you requested some.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are many formats a REST API can use, most APIs return data in the <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format. JSON is a data format made to be lightweight, easy for humans to read, and easy for machines to generate and parse.</p>
<p>Some web services, though, might use other formats. Common formats are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XML</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a>. If you interact with a Windows server, you might receive data in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOAP</a> format, which requires you to write a custom parser, since it’s based on XML.</p>
<p>When communicating with remote APIs, we don’t only receive structured data. It is common to receive media files like images or videos, which are transmitted as pure binary data.</p>
<p>Beware though that binary data does not come along with the initial response, to keep the latter lightweight. What you get are URLs in the JSON data usually pointing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content delivery network</a>. …</p></div></div>

However, it's one of the most confusing Hooks (at least in my experience). But if you spend some time to learn how it works, you'll see that it's actually a hidden gem 💎, a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p><p>I'll reveal this shiny gem <span>💎</span> for you in four steps:</p><ol><li>What is it used for?</li><li>The mental model</li><li>A couple of contrived examples (but they are really helpful for learning)</li><li>A couple of real-world examples</li></ol><p>This article assumes that you are familiar with React basics, as well as how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks.</p><h2><a id="what-is-useref-used-for" href="#what-is-useref-used-for"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>What is useRef used for?</a></h2><p>There are two use cases.</p><h3><a id="directly-access-dom-nodes" href="#directly-access-dom-nodes"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Directly access DOM nodes</a></h3><p>When combined with the <code>ref</code> attribute, we could use <code>useRef</code> to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively. In fact, this is really an escape hatch. We should only do this sparsely for things that React doesn't provide a declarative API for, such as focus management. If we use it for everything (in theory we could), we'd lose the benefit of <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/what-is-react#declarative-ui">React's declarative programming paradigm</a>.</p><h3><a id="persist-a-value-across-rerenders" href="#persist-a-value-across-rerenders"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Persist a value across rerenders</a></h3><p>This is what I'm going to focus on in this article.

And it clicked! If you are hearing the same clicking sound in your mind right now already, feel free to skip to <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/react-useref-by-example#example-1-previous-value--state">the examples section</a>. Otherwise, if you are not familiar with JavaScript classes or class instance variables, read on. This section is for you.</p><h3><a id="the-rerendering-time-loop" href="#the-rerendering-time-loop"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The "rerendering time loop"</a></h3><p>To understand how <code>useRef</code> works and why we need it, let's get started with a contrived (but useful) example. Can you build a counter without using the <code>useState</code> hook?</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>This doesn't work, even though the value of <code>count</code> increases on click. Why? React is oblivious to the change of local variables and, therefore, doesn't know when to update the DOM. We'd need to rerender the component, namely request React to call the component function <code>Counter</code>, to let the change reflected on the screen.</p><p>You can verify this by uncommenting the line <code>console.log('render')</code> right after <code>let count = 0</code>. The component isn't rendered when the user clicks the button.</p><p>OK. Then what if we force the component to render when <code>count</code> updates?</p><p>This doesn't work either. The count displayed on the page stays zero. Even worse, the count value in the console stopped working too. It's always <code>0</code>!</p><p>BTW, <code>useForceRender</code> above is a custom hook:</p><p>Why? This is what I call <strong><em>rerendering time loop</em></strong>.</p><div><p><img alt="Time loop" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Every time when the component rerenders, it goes into a time loop. All the local variables in the function will be reset to their original values. That's why <code>count</code> is always <code>0</code>.</p><p>That's no surprise, right? They are local variables defined in the function. When the function reruns, the variables are supposed to behave like that!</p><p>As straighforward as this sounds, sometimes it's easy to forget (I do it all the time). So remember, since a React component is rerendered all the time, all the local variables will go into a time loop, over and over again.</p><div><p>Does this "rerendering time loop" metaphor make sense to you?</p></div><p>So, we need a solution that survives this "rerendering time loop". We want to preserve the value no matter how many times the component is rendered. If we update <code>count</code> to <code>42</code>, at the next render it should still be <code>42</code>, not the initial value <code>0</code>.</p><p>Let's try the first approach: what if we move the variable out of the component function? It will no longer be affected by the rerendering time loop, right?</p><p>That's correct! It works! Yay!</p><h3><a id="component-instances" href="#component-instances"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Component instances</a></h3><p>But wait a second, what if we want to have two counters?</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Click both buttons a few times: </p></div></div></div></div></div><p>So our counters are still broken. Did you try it in the preview window? The two counters are tied together. Clicking one button changes the other counter too!</p><p>That's because both counters are tied to the same variable <code>count</code>. What we need instead is to have a <strong><em>separate</em></strong> variable for each <strong><em>instance</em></strong> of the counter.</p><p>So the requirements are:</p><ol><li>Persist a value across rerenders</li><li>Persist the value per component instance, throughout the full lifetime of that instance</li></ol><p>Introducing <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>But, but we are still using that <code>useForceRender</code> to update the DOM! If we comment out <code>forceRender()</code>, the counter stops working again! (try it)</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it relies on <code>useState</code> to work properly? Why don't we just use <code>useState</code>?</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it doesn't trigger a rerender when the value is updated?</p><p>In fact, being able to persist a value across rerenders <em>without</em> triggering another rerender is exactly why <code>useRef</code> is created. Sometimes we just don't want the component to rerender when the value is updated.</p><p>It's now time to look at a better example.</p><h2><a id="example-1-previous-value--state" href="#example-1-previous-value--state"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 1: previous value / state</a></h2><p>Let's modify the Counter component. Now we want to display the previous value of the counter whenever the button is clicked. We can do so using a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, and of course <code>useRef</code>.</p><p>Look, when saving the previous state in <code>useEffect</code>, we definitely don't want the component to rerender. Otherwise, it'd go into an infinite loop. So, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue!</p><h2><a id="example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval" href="#example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)</a></h2><p>Now let's look at a more useful example. How about a stop watch?</p><p>We can make the stop watch tick with a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code> and <code>setInterval</code>:</p><p>But how do we pause the stop watch?</p><p>We can add another state <code>ticking</code> and clear the interval when <code>ticking</code> is <code>false</code>. Let's give it a try:</p><p>Did you see the problem? Where should we define that variable <code>interval</code>?</p><p>If we define <code>interval</code> in the outer scope, we'll taste the wrath of the rerendering time loop -- <code>interval</code> will always be <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>We don't want to put it in state either, since it's really not something we would want to display on the UI. It's interval stuff.</p><p>Again, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue:</p><p>You can check out a fully working <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-cancelable-interval-uljky?file=/src/App.js">CodeSandbox here</a>.</p><h2><a id="example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat" href="#example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 3: Press and hold to repeat</a></h2><p>Let's check out the real thing! Just a reminder, this is what we want to build (remember to click and hold):</p><p>We are going to focus on the press-and-hold behavior:</p><ol><li>When the mouse is down, wait a little bit;</li><li>If the mouse is still down after a threshold, say 500 milliseconds, start repeatedly increasing the like count at an interval until the mouse is up;</li></ol><p>How would we implement this behavior?</p><p>In order to detect the press-and-hold gesture, we can use <code>setTimeout</code>. When the mouse is down, kick off the timeout. When the mouse is up, clear the timeout.</p><p>How do we set and clear the timeout when the component is rendered and rerendered, i.e. when the state <code>mouseDown</code> changes?</p><p>You already know the answer from Example 2, right? <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>Next, how do we repeatedly increase the like count? <code>setInterval</code> is what we need. And of course we'll use another ref to keep track of the interval reference across rerenders.</p><p>Finally, we can extract all the logic into a custom Hook <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code>:</p><p>When using the <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code> hook, remember to use <code>useCallback</code> to prevent excess renders due to the fact the function might be recreated on each render (time loop).</p><p>Check out the full source code in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/likebutton-usepressholdrepeat-3b1qo">this CodeSandbox</a></p><p>Note: The animation in this example is implemented with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.

	<p><span>Mon 01 March 2021</span></p><p>The <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/risc-v-cpu-part-1.html">previous instalment</a> of this
series was "basically an explanation of what FPGAs are and a 'hello world'
nMigen example."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In this post, I will be detailing the design of my CPU as
it currently stands, and going over the various mistakes I made along the way.
As with the previous post, I am primarily aiming this at software engineers who
are new to hardware design – but I hope it will be interesting to anyone
interested in nMigen, RISC-V, or CPU design generally.</p>
<p>I hope the mistakes I made along the way will be a useful frame for considering
these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/33229b5fdcee90cfdf776ccf925f560f0fa5ce82">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>An introduction to RISC-V</h2>
<p>RISC-V ("risk five") is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA).
"RISC" means "reduced instruction set computer", broadly meaning that the
ISA prioritises simple instructions. In contrast, CISC (complex instruction set
computer) ISAs are optimised to perform actions in as few instructions as
possible, hence their instructions are often more complex. ARM architectures
are RISC; x86-related architectures are CISC.</p>
<p>Usually in industry, ISAs are patented, so in order to implement the ISA you
need an (expensive) license from the vendor. Often, commercial ISAs are poorly
documented, with the motivation behind design details not always being
available even after such a license agreement.</p>
<p>From the RISC-V spec <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goals in defining RISC-V include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A completely <em>open</em> ISA that is freely available to academia and industry</li>
<li>a <em>real</em> ISA suitable for direct native hardware implementation, not just
simulation or binary translation.</li>
<li>An ISA that avoids "over-architecting" for a particular microarchitecture
style, but which allows efficient implementation in any of these.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a lot of commercial architectures are complex and burdened with
backwards-compatibility constraints. RISC-V offers a fresh start!</p>
<p>The ISA doesn't explain the details of how to design a CPU – it just
defines an abstract model of the CPU, mostly by defining what instructions the
CPU must support, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The encoding of the instructions (i.e. how to construct the machine code that
  the CPU will run)</li>
<li>The registers (the very fast, very small storage locations accessed directly
  by the CPU)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>How to actually create a CPU that realises these requirements is up to us \o/</p>
<h3>A quick note (feel free to skip if you don't have opinions about CPUs)</h3>
<p>I'm trying to design a single-stage CPU; that is, I'm trying to design a CPU
that retires one instruction per clock cycle with no pipelining.  Usually CPUs
have pipelining in place to maximise efficiency. I am hoping that avoiding this
will result in a simpler design more suitable to my learning. Perhaps it will
complicate other aspects of the design (like my program counter having 3
outputs), but I'm certainly finding it easier to hold the design in my
head when I only have to think about this clock cycle and the next. I will
likely discuss this in more detail in the next blog post where I implement the
load instructions. I have a plan for how to make these work in a single cycle,
but they do pose a particular challenge and I may change my design as a
consequence.</p>
<h2>Designing a CPU</h2>
<p>RISC-V defines various ISA modules; I will be implementing RV32I, the base
32-bit integer instruction set.</p>
<p>To design my CPU, I first looked at the JAL (jump and link) and the ADDI (add
immediate) instructions, and drew a block diagram of what hardware
would be needed to decode those instructions. I think the ADDI instruction is
easier to grasp if you're not used to thinking about how machine code is
encoded, so we'll start with that. If this all totally foreign to you, you
might enjoy my
<a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/how-to-flash-an-led.html">introduction to ARM assembly</a>.</p>
<h3>Decoding ADDI</h3>
<p><img alt="iri" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/integer-register-immediate.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for ADDI from RISC-V spec"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADDI adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to register <em>rs1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's break some of this down, imagining we're decoding such an instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immediate is analogous to a literal value in source code; the value itself
  is encoded in the instruction, rather than e.g. retrieved from a register.</li>
<li>The <em>opcode</em> field is the same value for all the instructions listed here. </li>
<li>Once we've read the <em>opcode</em>, we know that bits 12-14 contain the <em>funct3</em>
  field (3 for 3 bits), which encodes whether this is an ADDI instruction (or
  SLTI, ANDI &amp;c.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, somehow we will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the value stored in register <em>rs1</em><ul>
<li>Therefore, our register file needs an input for selecting this register
  to read, and an output for the data read from that register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add that to the immediate value<ul>
<li>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) will be helpful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Store the result in register <em>rd</em><ul>
<li>Our register file also needs write select and write data inputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign-extension will be necessary too – this is just the process of
taking a number narrower than (in our case) 32 bits, and filling in the
remaining bits such that two's complement arithmetic will be performed
correctly. I won't include this in the diagram below.</p>
<p>Implicit in all this is that we'll need some way to retrieve the instruction
itself and pass it to the instruction decoder. The <em>program counter</em> is
what tells the instruction memory which address to retrieve an instruction
from.</p>
<p><img alt="addi" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/addi.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the ADDI instruction. The instruction         decoder tells the register file to read from rs1 and write to rd. The         data read from rs1 and the immediate are inputs to the ALU. The output         of the ALU is written to rd. The program counter tells the instruction         memory which address to retrieve and instruction from, and the         instruction memory provides that instruction to the instruction         decoder."></p>
<p>I'm using thick cyan lines for data flow and thin magenta lines for control
flow.</p>
<h3>JAL</h3>
<p>Now let's try doing the same for JAL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jump and link (JAL) instruction [...] immediate encodes a signed offset
in multiples of 2 bytes. The offset is sign-extended and added to the <code>pc</code> to
form the jump target address. [...] JAL stores the address of the instruction
following the jump (<code>pc</code> + 4) into register <em>rd</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more going on here, particularly if you aren't familiar with
machine code. We noted above that the program counter sets which instruction
will be executed next. Usually the program counter simply increments to the
next address each cycle – that's how we continue to execute our program!
However, say our program calls a subroutine stored elsewhere in memory; we'd
need a way to <em>jump</em> to the subroutine address. Or, say we wanted an infinite
loop (ubiquitous in embedded software!); we'd need a way to <em>jump</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> back to
the address at the start of the loop. JAL allows for these situations.</p>
<p>The "link" part of JAL is the part where the next instruction is stored in the
destination register. This is convenient when the jump is used to execute a
subroutine: once the subroutine completes, we can jump back to that stored
instruction address.</p>
<p>Here's the encoding for JAL:</p>
<p><img alt="jal-enc" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal-enc.png" title="Diagram of instruction encoding for JAL from RISC-V spec"></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opcode uniquely defines the JAL instruction (no other instructions share
  this opcode)</li>
<li>We need to unshuffle the immediate to get the offset</li>
<li>The LSB<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> of the immediate is not encoded because it must be 0: only
  offsets in multiples of 2 bytes are supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unshuffling caused me some pain in my code, so it's amusing to me that it
won't be part of the block diagram below. But it's part of the internals of the
instruction decoder, not its interface, which is what we are determining with
these diagrams. The shuffled bits might seem nonsensical, but they're chosen to
maximise overlap with other instruction formats in RISC-V.</p>
<p><img alt="jal" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/jal.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL instruction."></p>
<h3>Putting ADDI and JAL together</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to draw a block diagram that implements both ADDI and
JAL. The first obvious problem: the inputs to the ALU are different in both
cases, as is the wiring of the output. We need some kind of logic block that
can pick between them depending on some control signal: a multiplexer (mux).</p>
<p>We also need a way to tell the program counter whether the next instruction
address should come from a set address or from incrementing the current
address.</p>
<p>Here's what my design looks like at the moment (excluding a few things I have
because I know I'll need them later, like two read select/data signals on the
register file):</p>
<p><img alt="mux" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/mux.png" title="Block diagram showing the necessary connections         between components to implement the JAL and ADDI instructions."></p>
<h2>Implementing the design</h2>
<p>As covered in my previous blog post, I'm using
<a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a> to implement my design. As I'm
currently designing a single-stage CPU, more of my design is
combinatorial, rather than synchronous, because I don't require the additional
state that pipelining necessitates. This most likely means my design is
unable to run quickly, but that's not a concern of mine.</p>
<p>I don't think it's helpful to post all the source code of my implementation in
this blog, but I will include some code here to illustrate mistakes that I made
and what I learned from them.</p>
<h3>Mistake #1: thinking about my logic circuit sequentially</h3>
<p>I initially implemented my program counter incorrectly after I got really
confused about when synchronous updates would take effect. I initially only had
the <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_inc</code> outputs because I didn't really understand the difference
between <code>pc</code> and <code>pc_next</code>.  It's taken some getting used to thinking about the
whole logic circuit "happening at once"<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>, rather thinking sequentially like
I would when writing software.  This is what led to my confusion. Properly
conceptualising your circuit in this way is key, and a challenge if you're used
to writing software.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/daniel-bourke" target="_blank" rel="follow">Daniel here</a>, I'm 50% of the instructors behind the <a href="https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank" rel="follow">Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery</a> course. I also write regularly about machine learning and on my own blog as well as make videos on the topic on YouTube.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 14th edition of Machine Learning Monthly. A 500ish (+/-1000ish, usually +) word post detailing some of the most interesting things on machine learning I've found in the last month. </p>
<p>Since there's a lot going on, the utmost care has been taken to keep things to the point.</p>

<h3>The Zero To Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course has launched!</h3>
<p>During COVID lockdowns of 2020, I decided to brush up my TensorFlow skills by getting TensorFlow Developer Certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk" target="_blank" rel="follow">I made a video about how I did it</a> (in a month or so) and afterwards had a bunch of questions from others asking how they could too.</p>
<p>The video talked about different resources I used but I wanted to go a step further.</p>
<p>So to answer the question of “I want to learn TensorFlow, where do I start?” I created the <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course</a>.</p>
<p>It teaches 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fundamentals of deep learning (a machine learning paradigm taking the world by storm)</li>
<li>The fundamentals of TensorFlow (a framework used to write deep learning algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks)</li>
<li>How to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification (this is optional but requires 1 &amp; 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire course is code-first. Which means I use code to explain different concepts and link external non-code first resources for those who want to learn more.</p>
<p>I’m so pumped for this release, it’s the biggest thing I’ve ever worked on! I’d love if you checked it out: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/academy">Sign up on the Zero to Mastery Academy</a> to start taking the course now</li>
<li>Learn more about the topics and projects covered in the course <a href="https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse" target="_blank" rel="follow">here</a></li>
<li>View <a href="https://www.github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="follow">all of the course materials on GitHub</a> (more to come)</li>

</ul>
<h3>A Machine Learning Deployment Tutorial for 20% Software Engineers for Stanford’s CS329s</h3>
<p>I started learning machine learning in 2017 using Stanford lectures and tutorials. So when Chip Huyen (featured below) asked if I’d like to create and deliver one myself, I said yes.</p>
<p>My goal was to break down the barrier for machine learning model deployment by highlighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model deployment is like model building (except instead of stacking together layers, you stack together cloud services)</li>
<li>The holy grail of ML-powered applications: the data flywheel (introduced in <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/machine-learning-monthly-january-2021/">January 2021’s ML monthly</a>)</li>
<li>What do you do when (not if) your model fails?</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover this, during the tutorial we deploy a TensorFlow image classification model (spoiler: one of the model’s we build in the TensorFlow for Deep Learning course!) to Google Cloud and use it to power Food Vision (a Streamlit app which classifies different photos of food). Watch below and head here to <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/cs329s-ml-deployment-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="follow">see the code &amp; slides</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>From the ML community 🙋‍♀️</strong></h2>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Using Deep Learning to Read Brainwaves</a></h3>
<p>Imagine being able to put on a helmet and instead of typing on a keyboard, all you do is think about what’d you like to type. And the sensors in the helmet pickup what you’re thinking and translate them to the screen. Well that’s what Muhtasham and team are working towards. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08562" target="_blank" rel="follow">Their latest paper</a> takes electroencephalogram (EEG) from a brain-computer interface (BCI) and passes them through a deep neural network to try and predict what key you’re thinking of pressing on a keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>I take being able to type for granted now. I learned when I was young playing online video games. But what if you couldn’t type? What if you didn’t have the ability to use your limbs or speak? How would you communicate in the digital world? Here’s where BCI’s come in. Instead of you physically performing an action, a BCI reads the electric signals in your brain and translates them to the physical world. This is one of the avenues Neuralink is heading down.</p>
<p>Sensational work Muhtasham and team, for those interested in reading how these systems work, read A Neural Network for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's guide to TensorFlow Serving</a></h3>
<p>Last time with how to turn your PyTorch models into an API, this time how to turn your TensorFlow models into an API using TensorFlow Serving.</p>
<p>In the machine learning model deployment tutorial above I used Google’s AI Platform to deploy a trained TensorFlow model. AI Platform runs TensorFlow Serving under the hood. So if you want to see how you could set up your own TensorFlow model API (so you can send data to it and receive predictions back), check out <a href="https://github.com/alvarobartt/serving-tensorflow-models" target="_blank" rel="follow">Álvaro's TensorFlow Serving tutorial on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>An aside, I really love this format of sharing your work. Right within GitHub. A great way to demonstrate skill on a certain topic, code and word explanations interlaced together.</p>
<h2><strong>From the interwebs 🕸</strong></h2>
<h3>Chip Huyen’s outstanding machine learning blog (2 recent posts)</h3>
<p>I’m a big fan of Chip’s work. Last year we saw her post on the MLOps (all the parts of a machine learning system around the model) tooling landscape. Now there’s a version 2 and an essay on machine learning going real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Post 1:</strong> <strong><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/30/mlops-v2.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">MLOps Tooling Landscape v2</a></strong></p>
<p>The takeaway from this post is that the ML tooling landscape is growing (and fast). </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Well it seems many of the development roadblocks for ML systems have been worked out and now solutions for those common roadblocks are being built.</p>
<p>Such as Weights &amp; Biases for tracking your machine learning experiments or full-blown enterprise AI solutions like DataRobot.</p>
<p><strong>Post 2: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">ML is going real-time</a></strong></p>
<p>In this post Chip breaks down ML going real-time into <strong>online predictions</strong> and <strong>online learning</strong> and emphasises the importance of speed in machine learning. </p>
<p>The simple analogy goes like this: if your app is slow, people won’t use it.</p>
<p>For <strong>online predictions</strong> (predictions made <em>while</em> someone is using your ML system), if they’re slow, people will get tired of them. For some systems, such as self-driving cars, fast online predictions are required. The classic trade off here is how much performance do you sacrifice for speed (e.g. smaller models are faster but don’t score as well).</p>
<p>For <strong>online learning</strong> (how quickly does your ML system update itself?), if you’re getting new data every hour but only updating your models every week, is your service performing as well as it should? This is a tough problem. Because traditionally ML is taught with static data (train, validation, test sets) but when you get to large scale, you’ve got data (called streaming data) coming in all the time so what exactly should you train and evaluate on? </p>
<p>Take the example of a recommendation system such as Netflix, if there’s a new series out and everyone is watching so you get recommended it but then you try it out and don’t like it. But because Netflix only update their system once a week, the new series stays on your homepage for a whole week (it doesn’t take into account you didn’t like it), is that a good experience? </p>
<p>How should one do online learning?</p>
<p>This is still being worked out. But Chip’s post talks more about the pain points and possible solutions.</p>
<h3>Use GitHub for your Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)</h3>
<p>If your code is on GitHub, why not use it to do all of your MLOps (model evaluation, model retraining, continuous integration, continuous deployment) as well?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mlops.githubapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow">GitHub for MLOps</a> page is a collection of blog posts, examples, talks and tools (e.g. GitHub Actions) showcasing how you can facilitate MLOps with GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Find yourself running a series of similar experiments over and over? </p>
<p>Automate, automate, automate.</p>
<p>Use GitHub to watch your codebase for updates and then every time you commit a change, run a series of experiments behind the scenes (such as testing your models and then posting the results in a GitHub issue for you).</p>
<h3>Upgrade your software engineering skills as a machine learning practitioner</h3>
<p>If you’re like me and learned to write Python code in Jupyter Notebooks, when you first heard someone say things like: “just put it into a Python script”, “run this bash command”, “put an API on top of your model and deploy it”, “wrap your app in a Docker container” and thought “wtf???”</p>
<p>LJ Mirander’s post on <em><a href="https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/11/15/data-science-swe/" target="_blank" rel="follow">How to improve software engineering skills as a (data science) researcher</a></em> uses the narrative of creating a machine learning service (an app which uses machine learning) and then explains each of the above and how they fit together.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get your machine learning models into the hands of others, software engineering skills like the ones LJ discusses are crucial. </p>
<h3>freeCodeCamp's (upcoming) Data Science &amp; Machine Learning curriculum</h3>
<p>Coming soon from one the best resources to learn to code online: a full-blown data science &amp; machine learning curriculum.</p>
<p>freeCodeCamp started out teaching web development for free in the browser. </p>
<p>Now they’re gearing up to do the same with data science and machine learning.</p>
<p>From foundational mathematics (linear algebra, matrix algebra, calculus) to EDA (exploratory data analysis), to supervised and unsupervised algorithms to tools like SQL, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, when its done, this’ll be an outstanding resource.</p>
<p>All for free!</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>Educational resources are already abundant. There’s a shortage of willingness to learn. </p>
<p>But what helps grow that willingness to learn is world-class educators who inspire others to create their own path. And freeCodeCamp is full of world-class educators.</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Python Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Python Dilemma  ⚖️</h3>
<p><a href="https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2021/02/pythons-tug-of-war-between-beginner.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">This was an interesting article</a>. Python has become the most popular language in the world because it is so beginner friendly. However, as more and more people use it, the need to include more advanced features grows as well. This is a challenge that all technical projects face as time passes and they grow.</p>
<h3>Weekend Project Idea 🎏</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/building-rich-terminal-dashboards/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Rich</a> is a python tool that allows you to beautify CLIs. This weekend, spend some time making all of your CLIs beautiful so you look like you are doing important work at your home or coffee shop or when your boss walks behind you (you know, once people go back to offices of course).</p>
<h3>Constant Folding In Python 🧬</h3>
<p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is Constant Folding where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner. <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it in this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Integers 🥇</h3>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are arbitrary-precision integers, also known as bignums. No idea what any of that means? <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-8-how-python-integers-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Read all about integers here</a>.</p>
<h3>Pyston vs CPython ⚾️ 🥎</h3>
<p>Pyston 2.1 Is Blowing Past Python 3.8/3.9 Performance. With this past week's release of Pyston 2.1 as an alternative Python interpreter I was curious to see how the performance compared to that of upstream Python... <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Pyston-2.1-vs-Python-3.8-3.9" target="_blank" rel="follow">So here are some weekend benchmarks with a Ryzen 9 5900X system</a>.</p>
<h3>WTF Python 🤸‍♀️</h3>
<p>Python, being a beautifully designed high-level and interpreter-based programming language, provides us with many features for the programmer's comfort. But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious at first sight.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here's a fun project</a> attempting to explain what exactly is happening under the hood for some counter-intuitive snippets and lesser-known features in Python.</p>
<h3>Google Sponsors Python 💰</h3>
<p>Google has become a visionary sponsor for the Python Software Foundation. <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">You do that by donating a lot of money</a>. Nice to see the support!</p>
<h3>Pattern Matching in Python 🎲</h3>
<p>The Python steering council has, after some discussion, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/845480/" target="_blank" rel="follow">accepted</a> the controversial proposal to add a pattern-matching primitive to the language. The pattern matching process takes as input a pattern (following <code>case</code>) and a subject value (following <code>match</code>). <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Learn all about it here</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Strings Are Immutable 💡</h3>
<p>Each time you make a change to a string variable, you are actually producing a brand new string. Because of this, tutorials out there warn you to avoid string concatenation inside a loop and advise using join instead for performance reasons. Even the official documentation says so!</p>
<p>This is wrong. Sort of.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/pythonstringsaremutable.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">There is a common case for when strings in Python are actually mutable</a>.</p>
<p>Once you are confused by that one, <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-9-how-python-strings-work/" target="_blank" rel="follow">read this</a>.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis Trick  📈</h3>
<p>A great strategy to use when faced with a tricky data analysis problem is to reshape the dataset into a format that turns it into an easy problem. In this article we will look at an example involving a simple calculation and extensive reshaping. <a href="https://drawingfromdata.com/pandas/reshaping/Making-a-difficult-data-analysis-problem-trivial.html" target="_blank" rel="follow">Here is a walkthrough of how to do it</a>.</p>
<h3>Python Microservices With gRPC 🏭</h3>
<p>Microservices are a way to organize complex software systems. Instead of putting all your code into one app, you break your app into microservices that are deployed independently and communicate with each other. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-microservices-grpc/" target="_blank" rel="follow">This tutorial</a> teaches you how to get up and running with Python microservices using gRPC, one of the most popular frameworks.</p>
<h3>Do Benchmarks Matter? 🪤</h3>
<p><a href="https://suade.org/dev/12-requests-per-second-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="follow">I highly recommend this read</a>. The summary? If your python  service is receiving 100,000 requests a second, it's likely that the specific Python framework you use is not going to be the bottleneck. Especially if your API is stateless and you can scale it via Kubernetes or similar. At that point, a good database, with decent schema design and good architecture are going to matter far more. Having said that, if you do want more processing power, use PyPy... just don't worry about the web frameworks you use.</p>
<h3>Concurrency With Python 🚿</h3>
<p>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each. <a href="https://python.hamel.dev/concurrency/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>32nd issue! If you missed them, you can <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/?tag=WDM#monthly">read the previous issues of our Web Developer Monthly newsletter here</a>.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>If it’s your first time here… (otherwise, skip this part)</strong></h2>
<p>Being a web developer is a fantastic career option. You have many job opportunities, you can work around the world, and you get to solve hard problems. </p>
<p>One hard thing, however, is staying up to date with the constantly evolving ecosystem. You want to be a top-performing web developer, coder, programmer, software developer, but you don’t have time to select from hundreds of articles, videos and podcasts each day.</p>
<p>This monthly newsletter is focused on keeping you up to date with the industry, keeping your skills sharp, without wasting your valuable time. I curate and share the most important articles, news, resources, podcasts and videos of the month. </p>
<p>Think <a href="https://tim.blog/about" target="_blank" rel="follow">Tim Ferriss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" rel="follow">the Pareto Principle</a> (80/20 rule) meeting the Software Development world. What’s the 20% that will get you 80% of the results?</p>

<h2><strong>Let's dive in. Here's what you missed in February 2021 as a Web Developer…</strong></h2>
<h3>Architecture.md 🦾</h3>
<p>An interesting idea around including this type of file in all of your projects. The idea? As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project. Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it. Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change. This is the main rule of thumb for ARCHITECTURE — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change. Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code. Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</p>
<h3>Free Tools For Web Developers ✂️</h3>
<p>Some tools and assets to help you build your next project since we are best friends by now (<em>unless this is your first time reading my articles… in that case let’s take things slow</em>):</p>

<h3>JavaScript Memory Management 🧠</h3>
<p>Most of the time, you can probably get by fine not knowing anything about memory management as a JavaScript developer. After all, the JavaScript engine handles this for you. At one point or another, though, you'll encounter problems, like memory leaks, that you can only solve if you know how memory allocation works.</p>
<p><a href="https://felixgerschau.com/javascript-memory-management" target="_blank" rel="follow">In this article</a>, you will learn how memory allocation and garbage collection works and how you can avoid some common memory leaks.</p>

<li>Looks like even Amazon is all aboard the React train. They now have a new tutorial on their website: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-server-side-rendering-for-react-in-aws-lambda/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Building server-side rendering for React in AWS Lambda</a>. Don't worry, they haven't forgotten about Vue 3 either: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/amplify-javascript-releases-support-for-vue-3/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Amplify JavaScript releases support for Vue 3</a></li>

<h3>New Browser Has Entered The Chat 👾</h3>
<p><a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/beam/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Beam has raised $9.5m</a> to take on some of the biggest browser companies in the world like Microsoft, Google and Mozilla, by creating a new web browser. Looks like they will be using Chromium underneath the hood. <em>“It’s basically a cultural search engine.”</em></p>
<h3>No More Frontend 😿</h3>
<p><a href="https://soynomm.com/blog/i-dont-want-to-do-frontend-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interesting opinion piece</a> of a frontend developer who has had enough and wants to focus on backend development. <em>"I suppose with the increase of complexity in what we want to achieve on the web the stack to achieve it with has had to also increase in complexity. For me, personally, it's too much. I want to have a personal life and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour of .js in fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant. I don't want to learn nor use a million different tools. I don't want to know a bit about everything and a lot about nothing."</em></p>
<h3>Interesting Question Of The Month 🕺</h3>
<p>This should be changed to QUESTIONS of the month, because there are 7. Can you answer <a href="https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-closures-interview-questions" target="_blank" rel="follow">these 7 JavaScript closures interview questions</a>? Share your results!</p>
<h3>Deno Fanboy 🦕</h3>
<p>My heavy bias towards Deno must be present in all newsletters, so here it is: <a href="https://evrone.com/ryan-dahl-interview" target="_blank" rel="follow">An interview with the creator of Deno: Ryan Dhal</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Google Proposes New Sandbox 🧨</h3>
<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="follow">is proposing a new idea</a> to keep advertising on the web but with a more privacy focus in mind. How? Interest-based advertising. They call it
Federated Learning of Cohorts <em>(uh la la, sounds fancy)</em>. It proposes a new way for businesses to reach people with relevant content and ads by clustering large groups of people with similar interests. This approach effectively hides individuals “in the crowd” and uses on-device processing to keep a person’s web history private on the browser. </p>
<h3>Functions As Callbacks 📞</h3>
<p>A simple message in this one - Don't use functions as callbacks unless they're designed for it. Jake always has great articles and this one <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2021/function-callback-risks/" target="_blank" rel="follow">does not disappoint</a>.</p>

I present to you what you should do this weekend: <a href="https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux" target="_blank" rel="follow">Getting better at Linux with 10 mini-projects</a></p>

<p><span>I</span>f you’re a woman in India, getting from A to B is a series of negotiations. Leaving the house for a trip to the market? First there’s figuring out how to get there. A taxi? No guarantee of a metered fare, and the driver might flat out refuse, depending on where you’re going. The metro? Faster than the bus, but there’s the long walk to the station, and sidewalks are a luxury in much of urban India. Then there’s harassment, an experience so widespread in public areas that over <a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20160523153959-37tlt/">80% of women</a> in Indian cities say they have faced it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When rideshare companies like Uber and Ola <a href="https://qz.com/india/1696728/ola-has-a-lead-over-uber-in-indias-ride-hailing-market/">entered India in the early 2010s</a>, these logistical negotiations changed. In the years since, rideshare apps have become a lifeline for women in urban areas, an alternative to risks they faced on public transport or in taxis. That’s not to say rideshares remove the risk altogether: in 2014, a 26-year-old Delhi woman was kidnapped and raped by her Uber driver, a case that led to a lawsuit against Uber for how they <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42291495">handled the victim’s medical records</a>. The app was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/world/asia/new-delhi-bans-uber-after-driver-is-accused-of-rape.html">banned in Delhi</a> for over a year but has since grown to dominate the market along with its local competitor Ola; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-india-ola-analysis/uber-seen-girding-for-battle-with-ola-in-india-ahead-of-ipo-idUSKBN1H424L">combined, the two companies hold 80% of the Indian taxi market</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ubiquity of rideshare cabs has had a lasting impact on the urban-dwelling women of India, with ripple effects reaching stay-at-home moms, workers, and college students. <em>Rest of World </em>spoke to six women who live in Kolkata, a city of 14 million, about how rideshares have changed the way they navigate their city.</p>

<h3>Menka Danda, 36</h3>



<h4><em>The beautician who needs her husband to book her rides</em></h4>



<p>As a beautician, my work takes me to all corners of Kolkata; I work through an app called Urban Company to provide at-home spa services. Often, it’ll be a new client whose house I’ve never been to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Uber came along, I used to take the buses. They’re always so crowded. My supply bags are huge and heavy; I carry all of my equipment in them and have to lug them around from client to client. On the bus or metro, sometimes there are no seats. Carrying the bags gets so tiring; by the time I’d reach my clients, I’d be exhausted. And in the summers, the heat is unbearable. If I have more clients in a day, I’ll always take Uber. If I take the bus, it takes so long, I can only visit one to two clients. On Uber, I can do four in one day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beauty service company trained me to use their app, but I’ve only studied till the sixth grade. Everything on the beauty app is in English, so I have difficulty reading the addresses for the clients I’m supposed to visit. Uber is the same way. I don’t know how to use the app on my own. My husband tags along with me on jobs, to help book the car on Uber and transfer addresses from the beauty service app. He used to be a private tutor for kids in our area, but since the lockdown, he hasn’t had much work. He’s like my assistant now. Because I’m not educated — even though I’m independent and the sole breadwinner in the family right now — I’m dependent on him.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When my husband can’t come with me, I ask the client, “Ma’am, I don’t know how to book rides on Uber, can you use the app on my mobile phone?” They can usually do it; you just have to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be so much easier if I could use the app on my own. If it were in Hindi, it’d be much better. But really, I wish I could just open the app and say, “I’m here, OK, come pick me up!” I wish I could just say it instead of having to type it out.</p>

<h3><strong>Lynette Hilt</strong>, 55</h3>



<h4><em>The <strong>stay-at-home mom who says Uber has changed her social life</strong></em></h4>



<p>I was a huge party animal. I used to go to nightclubs or to people’s houses for dinner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 1996 to 2003, I had a car and used to drive in Kolkata. Then I moved to Bangalore for two years and sold my car before the move. When I came back, I was dependent on friends for a ride. I used to turn down a lot of outings because of transportation, because it was so embarrassing to ask.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respect is the most important thing to me. I was so particular about my reputation that I missed a lot of opportunities. Once, I got all dressed up to go out and stood on the road waiting for a taxi that didn’t come. Eventually, I had to give up and walk back home. It was so sad.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Uber has become a lifeline and a status symbol. I am very safe. Uber comes right to the door. If it’s late at night, I have my 23-year-old son book it so that he can track me. As a single woman, I don’t have to depend on a man to pick me up or drop me home. I use them to go everywhere: the airport, the movies, the doctor, school-reunion parties, Sunday brunch, and to take my parents to the hospital for checkups. If it’s a short distance to get to church, then I take a moto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drivers are very well-dressed and very decent. I have a knee problem, so when I get off the moto, I have to hold them for support. I need reconstruction surgery. By that time in the trip, we have become friends. I tell them half my life history. We talk about religion. I tell them I have a son their age, but I don’t tell them that I live alone. I don’t mind if they speed.</p>

<h3><strong>Chaahat Mandhyan</strong>, 25</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> professional wealth manager who says the pandemic has made her dependent on men again</strong></em></h4>



<p>I took the bus only very occasionally because I feel claustrophobic. Uber Go in Kolkata is not economical. Uber Pool is, but you have to sit in it with a mindset that it’s going to take 30 to 40 minutes longer than it normally would. I’m always running late.</p>



<p>In Uber Go, I read about the markets in the papers on my way to work. On the Uber Moto, I listen to music. My favorite song is “We Didn’t Start the Fire” by Billy Joel. Five minutes before I reach work, I play this song, and I’m all pumped up. Before the pandemic, I would spend 6,000 bucks (about $82) a month on Uber.</p>

<p>The pandemic has increased my dependency on the male members of my community, like my building’s security guard. We bought a scooty so that my guard can drop me off and pick me up at the office. If I keep him waiting because I get delayed trying to finish work, then I get to hear him scream. I don’t know how to ride a scooty, and I’m really scared of sitting on it. My hands are constantly sweating. I just have to get over my fear of an accident. It’s more economical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night in December 2019, I took an Uber Go, around 8:30 p.m. I was going to a friend’s party and wearing a dress that came below my knees. I was carrying a shawl. It was cold. I set the Uber to drop me off at a place where my friend would pick me up from there. But I was late, and my friend got pissed, and he took off. Then I changed the destination on my Uber to the location of the party, about 6 kilometers away.</p>

<p>The driver said he wouldn’t go. Then he grabbed my ankle and ran his hand over it. I went blank. I removed his hand, and I said, “What’re you doing?” He turned around to talk to me. I got damn pissed and got out of the cab. I filed a complaint with Uber, but nothing happened. I didn’t want to create a scene. I couldn’t find an Uber, and I didn’t want to take a normal cab to such a big party. Uber is a matter of status.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if my phone conks off, I know I can charge my phone in an Uber. I feel safer knowing that I can use the maps on the Uber driver’s phone. But if you’re sitting in a yellow cab and if your phone’s not working or if it’s conked off, there’s no way of tracking. Charging phones is a huge plus point.</p>

<h3><strong>Dorothy Nair</strong>, 44</h3>



<h4><em>The<strong> primary school teacher who is afraid of driving</strong></em></h4>



<p>My husband is in the army, so we’ve moved every two years. We’ve lived all over. We’ve seen Punjab; we’ve been towards Maharashtra; we were in Ahmednagar; we stayed in Pune, Kapurthala, Pathankot, Amritsar, and Babina. Now we’re in Kolkata. My husband’s post is in Ambala. While he was here, we were able to use the army transport; the vehicle was available on call. But when the husband is posted elsewhere, then you don’t have the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I used to drive many years ago, when my daughters were small, but now I’m scared of driving. Once, I got into an accident in a very crowded area. One of those public buses banged into the car. It was such a crowded place, nothing could be done, and we couldn’t stop. I was worried about my daughter; she was with me, and she was very little. Ever since, I’ve been too afraid. When we came to Kolkata, I joined a driving school, and my friend would come with me. Maybe I’ll drive again when we can get a fully automatic car, the one where all you have to do is press a button. When my husband sends both his daughters abroad, and there’s money left over, maybe we can get a Tesla!</p>

It will probably only take a few years since most of the components are here already. It's just putting them together into a nice service thats missing.</strong></blockquote><p>‍</p><h2>How did we do it?</h2><p>We started experimenting with CLIP and BigGAN through <a href="https://twitter.com/advadnoun">Ryan Murdocks </a>"Big Sleep". We were testing what kind of images we could get by asking it to draw a green robot rocket with big cute eyes. At first the results were not very promising, but then something clicked, by nudging it with multiple different instructions it would not get stuck at a certain spot. Creating an endless stream of robots. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603cc19e0e844204feec4f1a_Screenshot%202021-03-01%20at%2011.21.49.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KH7VdJoUlw"></iframe></p></figure><p>Around 02:00 I realized that it probably would be able to understand what I was after! </p><p>‍</p><h4>Phase 1</h4><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fYlQvbH7dM"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TB-rHfjsXrY"></iframe></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNdiuLiTHqs"></iframe></p></figure><p>A frenzy of generation attempts and various methods followed from all three of us. We added reference images for the model to look at and also wrote some instructions such as "a rocket-robot" and "a robot with two cute eyes". We realized this was a viable method to get inspiration for our logo.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What is creativity? What is design?</h4><p>I'd argue that compression is a big part of it. Take cubism. The real world exists, cubes exists. Compress them and a creative piece is born. If there is something Neural networks and transformers are good at, it is compression. So if creativity is partly compression we would see evidence of "creativity" in these experiments. Searching and mixing between styles and objects to reach a goal. </p><p>Lets have a look at Filips <em>meme</em>-moment. <strong>LEMON&nbsp;DWARF</strong>!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79666417d71ef34a02cf_IMG_3121.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d798c81f70d59b82c8b9f_IMG_3122.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79b6a4585130a6c39613_IMG_3123.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fed49be52334588b156311c/603d79cefb777fb68d4bd739_IMG_3124.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhaZJtf9xf0"></iframe></p></figure><p>Filip had multiple instructions. Such as "a robot with big eyes", an image of a robot, and another image of a dwarf. Then once in a while the instructions "A lemon" is added. So now its forced to change its normal struggle to output a mix of a robot and a dwarf. Now it has to add a lemon in to the mix. <strong>The result is a LEMON&nbsp;DWARF ROBOT!</strong></p><p>Even if this is not true "AI-creativity" the lines are definitely turning blurrier. The model drawing is not trained on dwarfs or robots. It's just mixing its ability to draw a cassette player, a car and a dog to create something different, in between those objects.</p><h3>Phase 2</h3><p>After generating over 200.000 various cute robots we wanted something different. I created a new method for the interaction between BigGAN and CLIP to get different results. We switched around the reference images and started experiment a bit, creating reference images ourselves.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgarBSNbV0c"></iframe></p></figure><p>Heres we used the old instructions and reference images but added minimalism as instruction.

<p><a href="https://text.bargains/">Amulet</a> version 1<br>
2021-2-21</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>An amulet is a kind of poem that depends on language, code, and luck. To qualify, a poem must satisfy these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its complete Unicode text is 64 bytes or less. [1]</li>
<li>The hexadecimal SHA-256 hash of the text includes four or more 8s in a row. [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of poem was designed to be recorded, collected, and traded as an NFT using <a href="http://zora.engineering/">the Zora protocol</a>, but it can happily exist anywhere; an amulet absolutely does not have to be recorded on a blockchain to be an amulet.</p>
<p>If it is recorded, an additional formal criterion applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A carbon offset (1 metric ton or more) is purchased to compensate for the CO2 produced by the poem’s life on the blockchain, with proof of that purchase included in the poem’s metadata. (Here’s a <a href="https://text.bargains/amulet-metadata-sample.json">metadata template</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other rules! An amulet can be written in any language and any style. It can be composed, generated, or “discovered” in any way.</p>
<p>The number of sequential 8s in the hash determines the rarity of the amulet:</p>
<ul>
<li>8888: common</li>
<li>88888: uncommon</li>
<li>888888: rare</li>
<li>8888888: epic</li>
<li>88888888: legendary</li>
<li>888888888: mythic</li>
<li>8888888888+: ???</li>
</ul>
<p>And, while this isn’t part of the formal definition, it’s important to say that an amulet of any rarity should be judged by its overall effect, with consideration for both its linguistic and typographic qualities. In particular, an amulet’s whitespace, punctuation, and diacritics should all be “load bearing”.</p>
<p>A poem doesn’t become interesting simply by satisfying the constraints of some obscure form; likewise, an amulet isn’t collectible simply because it’s rare.</p>
<p>But... it doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p>A few stray considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Special appreciation is reserved for the amulet that is, in any sense, “aware of its circumstances”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is tempting to stylize “amulet” as “amul8”; this, unfortunately, is too dorky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is significant luck involved in the production of amulets; you might consider them bouillon cubes of fortune, useful as ingredients in other recipes, digital and occult.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<p>[1] Unicode (UTF-8) characters often require more than one byte; most programming languages provide a function to determine the byte size of a string.</p>
<p>[2] For most programmers, the SHA-256 hash function will be familiar and close to hand. For other readers interested in seeing how it works, <a href="https://text.bargains/scratchpad">this scratchpad might be useful</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Hash_standard">SHA-256 hash function</a> is ubiquitous in cryptography. In Zora, for example, it’s used to verify the identity of a piece of media, like a fingerprint. That media could be an MP4 movie, a PNG image, or a poem in plain text; if you change one frame, one pixel, or one comma, you change the SHA-256 hash entirely.</p>
<p>The hash is a cold hexadecimal spew –</p>
<p>9a120001cc88888363fc67c45f2c52447ae64808d497ec9d699dba0d74d72aab</p>
<p>– and, like a fingerprint, it doesn’t tell you anything about the entity it identifies. That’s by design, but even so, it feels strange for a value so pivotal to be totally disconnected from the underlying content, especially when it is <em>this value</em> that’s being collected and traded in cryptographic marketplaces.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the hash provides an immutable link between unique cryptographic object and free-floating digital media.</p>
<p>The amulet asks: what if we took that link seriously?</p>
<p>In a sense, the definition of the SHA-256 hash function created, at a stroke, all amulets of all rarities. Common to mythic, trashy to lovely, they have been hiding in the manifold combinations of language; we just didn’t know we ought to be looking for them. Until now!</p>
<p>How should we feel about this? I will invoke an amulet of uncommon rarity; you saw its SHA-256 hash above, five 8s in a row, lucky indeed:</p>

<p><img src="https://koaning.io/posts/maths-as-a-compiler/intro.png"></p>
<p>You might have heard of a mathematician named Gauss. He’s known for a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">contributions in mathematics</a> but my favorite contribution has a story. As <a href="https://www.nctm.org/Publications/Teaching-Children-Mathematics/Blog/The-Story-of-Gauss/">story goes</a> there was a maths teacher who wanted to read the newspaper while he was supposed to be teaching. So instead of teaching the teacher gave his pupils the assignment to add the numbers 1 through 100.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 98 + 99 + 100 = ?
\]</span> Instead of blindly calculating away, which was what most of the other students did, the young Gauss looked at the problem and started wondering if there perhaps was a more clever way of looking at the problem. After skribbling down some ideas he noticed a pattern.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
  s &amp; =  &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  s &amp; =   &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1  
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Maybe we can calculate <span>\(s\)</span> in another way.</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; 98 &amp; 99 &amp; 100   \\
  +  &amp; 100   &amp; 99 &amp; 98 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1 \\  
    \hline 
  = &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>It seems that if we sort cleverly the sum of these two identical series can also be expressed as a multiplication</p>
<p><span>\[ 
\underbrace{
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
   &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; \ldots &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 101 &amp; 
\end{array}
}_{100 \times 101 = 10100} 
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words;</p>
<p><span>\[ 
s = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
\]</span></p>

<p>What’s very neat about this “rethinking” is that it can also be generalized. If we’re interested in taking the sum from <span>\(1 \ldots n\)</span> then we can repeat the same trick.</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{array}{c *{6}{c@{\hspace{6pt} + \hspace{6pt}}} c}
    &amp; 1   &amp; 2   &amp; 3   &amp; \ldots &amp; n-2 &amp; n-1 &amp; n   \\
  + &amp; n   &amp; n-1 &amp; n-2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 3   &amp; 2   &amp; 1   \\
  \hline 
  = &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; \ldots &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1 &amp; n+1
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>This will give us the general formula.</p>
<p><span>\[
1 + \ldots + n = \sum_{x=1}^n x= \frac{n\times(n+1)}{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The brilliance of this is in recognizing that there are multiple ways of calculating the thing we’re interested in. Instead of doing a whole lof of addition, we can apply a mere multiplication and still get the same result.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful point, because it gives another angle to mathematics. There’s a “computer-science-voice” inside of me that’s looking at this and wondering if maybe … maths can be applied much more like a compiler than a calculator?</p>
<p>Think about it! This example shows that you might be able to rephrase an original problem into one that is much easier to calculate. We’re literally generating an alternative set of instructions. Just like the kid in the classroom, our program might also spend less time performing a multiplication compared to a long sequence of additions.</p>
<p>It’s a compiler that is potentially “better” too.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>You can actually run this as an experiment.</p>
<pre><code>
import numba as nb

def calc_sum(n):
    return sum(i for i in range(1, n + 1))

def calc_smart(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2

@nb.njit
def calc_sum_compiled(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res += i
    return res

@nb.njit
def calc_smart_compiled(n):
    return n * (n+1) / 2</code></pre>

<p>Even <em>if</em> we use the JIT compiler from <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html">numba</a> then we still see that we can get a huge speedup by using maths as a compiler. The fastest results are achieved by using both the compiler and the maths but the example is sufficient to show that you’re able to improve a compiler by using maths.</p>

            <section>
                <p>On August 24th, 1967 Charles A Kiesling at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperry_Corporation">Sperry Rand</a> filed a patent for 'Blinking Cursor for CRT Display'. One of the earliest innovations in the history of graphical user interface design, Kiesling’s patent allowed programmers to quickly see where the next character will be input on their console screen.</p><p>We all take the flashing cursor for granted today, but in the 1960s this was one of a succession of innovations that brought programmers closers to their code. Thanks to the introduction of electronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube">cathode ray tubes</a> (CRTs) just a few years earlier, programmers could now interact with their code directly through terminals connected to a console screen. Displaying character sets linked directly to a mainframe computer, the console not only increased a programmer’s productivity, it also offered the world a new perspective and relationship to computing that would go on to inspire future generations.</p><p>Kiesling lays out the problem to be solved with the blinking cursor in his <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3531796">original patent:</a></p><blockquote><em>The cursor in presently available systems has not satisfactorily performed the function for which it was intended. Whenever the cursor is positioned over a character that has already been painted on the screen, it becomes difficult to locate it. The more characters on the screen the more difficult it becomes to locate the cursor.</em></blockquote><p>Kiesling would stay at Sperry Rand until his retirement in 1993, where his designs and ideas helped lay the foundation for the modern computer world.</p><h2 id="computers-with-personality-a-love-of-consoles">Computers with Personality: A Love of Consoles</h2><p>Computing is so often a story of what’s coming next.

Console. </p><p>Like much of the very best technology and design, its easy to forget the lineage of iterations that got us here.

Before the console, programmers interfaced with mainframe computers via a standalone terminal. Early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters or teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY) - effectively a typewriter to enter the data into a computing system. Limited to the input of data, these early terminals were often referred to as dumb terminals that pre-dated computer console screens.</p><h3 id="the-model-33">The Model 33</h3><div><p>The archetypal teletype was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a> originally designed for the United States Navy, the Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 33 in 1963. The Model 33 was one of the first products to employ the newly standardized ASCII code.</p><p>Costing $700, the Model 33 was far more affordable than other options and with the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor">Video Display Unit</a> (VDU) consoles costing in excess of $10,000, its popularity extended well into the 1970s. By 1975 over 500,000 Model 32 and 33s were manufactured, going on to become one of the most popular terminals in history.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.18.34.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Teletype Model 33 introduced Bill Gates to programming. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33#/media/File:Teletype-IMG_7287.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The historical impact of the Model 33 was notable. The programming language BASIC was designed to be written and edited on a low-speed Teletype Model 33, with the slow speed of the Teletype Model 33 influencing the later user interface of minicomputer operating systems, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a>.</p><p>Fun fact: Bill Gates cites the Teletype Model 33 as his first computing experience. In 1973 Gates’ Lakeside Prep School Mothers Club used its garage sale proceeds to give students computer access. The club purchased a Model-33 teletype machine that connected over phone lines to a GE time sharing computer.</p><h3 id="glass-teletypes-and-the-console-vdus">Glass Teletypes and the Console: VDUs</h3><div><p>It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that the first glass teletypes entered the market, combing an input terminal with a Video Display Unit (VDU). The early consoles were relatively primitive, lacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>. They relied on individual logic gates and simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Large-scale_integration_(LSI)">LSI chips</a>, and were still connected to mainframe computers to do all the processing.</p><p>The shift to an ‘intelligent terminal’ was identifiable through the device’s ability to process inputs by the user with the terminal sending a block of data at time, rather than interrupting the main processing computer after every keystroke.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.21.57.png 1182w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Datapoint 3300 - One of the first general purpose video terminals. <a href="http://www.kuonlinedirectory.org/studygroups/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Almost-Forgotten-Story-of-Computer-Terminal-Corporation_4_2_16_small.pdf">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Designed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint">Computer Terminal Corporation</a>, the Datapoint 3300 was the first successful general purpose video terminal designed to compete with the Model 33 teletype.

It also set the benchmark for business video terminals with an 8 bit general purpose CPU, 24 x 80 green phosphor display, consumer friendly ergonomics and a futuristic design.</p><h3 id="ascii">ASCII</h3><div><p>As the use of terminals became more commonplace and new companies began to enter the market, so there was an increasing need for a standardization of character encoding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> (abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was developed from telegraph code, with the first commercial use in a seven-bit teleprinter developed by Bell Data Systems. </p><p>Based on the English alphabet, ASCII originally encoded 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers. Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable, including the digits 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, and punctuation symbols. The remaining 33 non-printing control codes originated from Teletype machines, though most of these are now obsolete. Later in 1981, <a href="https://blog.console.dev/p/97d42dc1-d2c1-464e-ab20-d160e7b34e7f/www.ibm.com">IBM</a> developed an extension called ‘code page 437’. In this version, some obsolete characters were replaced for graphic characters and a further 128 characters ranging from 128 to 255 were added. </p><p>With 95 printable characters in the original ASCII from 1963, it also offered artistically minded programmers the tools to create beautiful imagery from just a fixed width prompt.</p></div><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-14.13.05-2.png 1660w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Mad magazine's Alfred E.

The new protocol allowed similar sequences of input to be interpreted by the terminal as commands rather than text to be displayed on the console. </p><p>This standardization was popularized by the Digital VT100 in 1978, and thanks to the success, led to most new terminals and emulators that followed to support them. Over six million terminals in the VT series were sold based on the success of the VT100. Even today the majority of terminal emulators still interpret a portion of the original ANSI standard. </p><p>Designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> (DEC), DEC was one of the major players of the computer industry from the 1960s until the 1990s, when it struggled to compete in an increasingly competitive market driven by home computing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1000w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-15-at-13.24.57.png 1990w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>DEC VT100 terminal at the Living Computer Museum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100#/media/File:DEC_VT100_terminal.jpg">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="monochrome-monitors">Monochrome Monitors </h3><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/WiQSTgB-1.jpg 764w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hollywood was quick to embrace the rise of the console screen, quickly introducing the console as a protagonist in some of the biggest films of the 1970s and 80s.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				
<p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monkey-ball-part-1-banana-bunch-values/" data-type="post" data-id="645">we used Dolphin’s debugger to find the location of Player 1’s score in RAM</a>. In this article, our goal is to hack the score calculation routine so that the bonus goals do not award so many points.</p>



<p>Levels in Super Monkey Ball can have up to three separate exits: the normal Blue exit, a Green exit, and a Red exit. If you manage to get to a Green or Red exit, the game will let you skip a number of upcoming levels (e.g. skip the next 3 levels). In addition, it multiplies the score for completing the level by the number of levels skipped (e.g. you gain 3 times as many points as you would have with the normal exit). This is a totally bonkers amount of points, especially for levels which you can complete in only a few seconds and so also get the time bonus multiplier. In the below screenshot, the normal Blue exit would have awarded 3,386 points. Instead the game awards <em>130,158</em> points because I completed the level with the Red exit! There is some fun in a risk/reward calculation, but not when it’s this lopsided!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="188" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png 390w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px"></a></figure>



<p>It really incentivizes you to skip levels, which means you play less of the game, which… sucks. If we eliminate the level skip bonus entirely, then it becomes a more interesting trade-off. You can either skip a few levels and so be less likely to lose lives but lose out on score, or you can choose to risk completing those levels and gain all the points from those levels you would have skipped. It’s a much more interesting mechanic than always choosing the Red exit to get that massive score dump.</p>



<p>So let’s start by finding the code that alters your score upon level completion. As in part 1, we set a memory watch breakpoint on Player 1’s score, then complete the level. As the score tally displays, Dolphin breaks and we have our score routine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="635" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-768x477.png 768w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a couple interesting things to notice in this screenshot. First, you can see the current instruction is storing the updated score into our player’s struct, which is what we expected/hoped to find. Just before that is where it adds the new points into the existing score. You can see in <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are the new score value to be added and the player’s current score, respectively. So this really looks like the routine we wanted to find. Finally, notice the <code>LR</code> value, which is where we jumped from to get into this routine. Let’s head to that code and see what called this routine. More specifically, we want to know where the beginning of this routine is, since we’ve paused execution somewhere in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="102" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png 512w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure>



<p>That tells us where the score calculation routine actually begins. Let’s go see what happens there at the start of this function.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="469" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png 500w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure>



<p>Well that… sure is some PowerPC code. I can read assembly if I have to, but that looks like a real chore to try to understand. Notice the start of the routine is something like 500 bytes away from where the actual store happens. I don’t want to try to understand that much assembly.</p>



<p>Well luckily, just a few years ago the NSA (yes, that NSA) made their internal software reverse-engineering (SRE) tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a> public. Among many other things, it is capable of disassembling binaries into C source. I figured it probably was capable of handling PPC binaries (it is), but I wondered if anyone had specifically tried it with a GameCube binary. Turns out somebody had: I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hmapl.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/ghidra-a-potentially-useful-reverse-engineering-tool/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about using a Ghidra plugin for the GameCube’s PPC variant to decompile Harvest Moon. I also found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank">a Ghidra plugin specifically for loading GameCube binaries</a> dumped from ISOs. It’s pretty painless to install. Once that’s done, you can use Dolphin to dump the game’s executable to disk, to load into Ghidra. Extract the game’s system data using Dolphin, and it will dump some binaries into a directory.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png"><img loading="lazy" width="823" height="751" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png 823w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-768x701.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px"></a></figure>



<p>The one we’re interested in is main.dol, which is the game’s main executable. Loading that into Ghidra will prompt you to analyze the binary. On my machine, that only took about a minute to complete. Now I was ready to see if Ghidra could turn that PPC code into readable C code. So I jumped to the start of the score routine and…</p>

<p>It worked! Without any symbol names, the code is hard to read, but it’s legible enough. This was so exciting to see!! I’ve been wanting to hack this score code for at least a decade. And look at those if-statements! They’re comparing something against ‘<code>G</code>‘ and ‘<code>R</code>‘. Green and Red exits, perhaps? I couldn’t wait to figure out what this code was doing.</p>



<p>I’ve inserted the code in text format here, with some interesting lines highlighted for discussion below.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the raw code, you can see some interesting stuff. At [1] is our current PC, that <code>stw</code> instruction which we broke on back at the start of the article. You can see it’s adding the value of <code>uVar4</code> into the player’s score location. Scrolling up to [2], you see where <code>uVar4</code> is calculated, as the product of <code>iVar3</code> and <code>iVar6</code>. I bet one of those is the base score, and the other is the bonus multiplier. Going further up to [3], you’ll see <code>iVar3</code> does indeed seem to be derived from some global value. I bet that global is the current time, and these calculations are converting the internal time representation into points and maybe doing some rounding on the result. Looking around for more interesting stuff, the lines marked with [4] look a lot like bit flags. From the code flow, I bet that’s used for deciding which parts of the score calculation to display on screen when tallying the score.</p>



<p>So with some of those guesses, I used Ghidra to rename some of the local variables to be more descriptive. Here’s what I ended up with for everything that goes into calculating <code>uVar4</code> (I trimmed all the later stuff).</p>



<pre><code>  iVar2 = DAT_802f1f18;
  iVar4 = DAT_801eec4c;
  if ((param_1 &lt; 4) &amp;&amp; (1 &lt; param_1)) {
<strong><span>    score_multiplier = (int)DAT_801f3a7a; //[4]</span></strong>
    iVar5 = *(int *)(*(int *)(DAT_802f1f30 + 0xc) + 0x40);
    time_score = (DAT_801f3a74 * 100) / 0x3c + (DAT_801f3a74 * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    time_score = time_score - (time_score &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    out_flags = 0;
    exit_data = iVar5;

<h2 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h2>
<p>The x86 instruction set architecture is at the heart of CPUs that power our home computers and remote servers for over two decades. Being able to read and write code in low-level assembly language is a powerful skill to have. It enables you to write faster code, use machine features unavailable in C, and reverse-engineer compiled code.</p>
<p>But starting out can be a daunting task. The official documentation manuals from Intel are well over a thousand pages long. Twenty years of continual evolution with backward compatibility have produced a landscape with clashing design principles from different eras, deprecated features occupying space, layers upon layers of mode switches, and an exception to every pattern.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will help you gain a solid understanding of the x86 <abbr title="instruction set architecture">ISA</abbr> from basic principles. I will focus more on <em>building a clear mental model</em> of what’s happening, rather than giving every detail precisely (which would be long and boring to read). If you want to make use of this knowledge, you should simultaneously refer to another tutorial that shows you how to write and compile a simple function, and also have a list of CPU instructions open for referencing. My tutorial will start out in familiar territory and slowly add complexity in manageable steps – unlike other documentation that tend to lay out the information all at once.</p>
<p>The prerequisites to reading this tutorial are working with binary numbers, moderate experience programming in an imperative language (C/C++/Java/Python/etc.), and the concept of memory pointers (C/C++). You do not need to know how CPUs work internally or have prior exposure to assembly language.</p>

<p>When reading this tutorial, it’s helpful to write and test your own assembly language programs. This is most easily done on Linux (harder but possible on Windows). Here is a sample function in assembly language:</p>
<pre>.globl myfunc
myfunc:
    retl</pre>
<p>Save it in a file called my-asm.s, and compile it with the command: <tt>gcc -m32 -c -o my-asm.o my-asm.s</tt>. There is no way to run the code at the moment, because it would require either interfacing with a C program or writing boilerplate code for interacting with the <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr> to handle the starting/printing/stopping/etc. At the very least, being able to compile code gives you a way to verify that your assembly programs are syntactically correct.</p>
<p>Note that my tutorial uses the AT&amp;T assembly language syntax instead of Intel syntax. The underlying concepts are still the same in both cases, but the notation is a bit different. It’s possible to mechanically translate from one syntax to the other, so there is no need for much concern.</p>

<h2 id="2-basic-execution-environment">2. Basic execution environment</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/cpu-model.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>An x86 CPU has eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. For historical reasons, the registers are named {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, <code>edx</code>, <code>ebx</code>, <code>esp</code>, <code>ebp</code>, <code>esi</code>, <code>edi</code>}. (Other CPU architectures would simply name them <code>r0</code>, <code>r1</code>, ..., <code>r7</code>.) Each register can hold any 32-bit integer value. The x86 architecture actually has over a hundred registers, but we will only cover specific ones when needed.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, a CPU executes a list of instructions sequentially, one by one, in the order listed in the source code. Later on, we will see how the code path can go non-linearly, covering concepts like if-then, loops, and function calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/register-aliasing.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There are actually eight 16-bit and eight 8-bit registers that are subparts of the eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. These features come from the 16-bit era of x86 CPUs, but still have some occasional use in 32-bit mode. The 16-bit registers are named {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>, <code>sp</code>, <code>bp</code>, <code>si</code>, <code>di</code>} and represent the bottom 16 bits of the corresponding 32-bit registers {<code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code>, ..., <code>edi</code>} (the prefix “e” stands for “extended”). The 8-bit registers are named {<code>al</code>, <code>cl</code>, <code>dl</code>, <code>bl</code>, <code>ah</code>, <code>ch</code>, <code>dh</code>, <code>bh</code>} and represent the low and high 8 bits of the registers {<code>ax</code>, <code>cx</code>, <code>dx</code>, <code>bx</code>}. Whenever the value of a 16-bit or 8-bit register is modified, the upper bits belonging to the full 32-bit register will remain unchanged.</p>

<h2 id="3-basic-arithmetic-instructions">3. Basic arithmetic instructions</h2>
<p>The most basic x86 arithmetic instructions operate on two 32-bit registers. The first operand acts as a source, and the second operand acts as both a source and destination. For example: <code>addl %ecx, %eax</code> – in C notation, this means: <code>eax = eax + ecx;</code>, where <code>eax</code> and <code>ecx</code> have the type <code>uint32_t</code>. Many instructions fit this important schema – for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>xorl %esi, %ebp</code> means <code>ebp = ebp ^ esi;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>subl %edx, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx - edx;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>andl %esp, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax &amp; esp;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few arithmetic instructions take only one register as an argument, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>notl %eax</code> means <code>eax = ~eax;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>incl %ecx</code> means <code>ecx = ecx + 1;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bit shifting and rotation instructions take a 32-bit register for the value to be shifted, and the fixed 8-bit register <code>cl</code> for the shift count. For example: <code>shll %cl, %ebx</code> means <code>ebx = ebx &lt;&lt; cl;</code>.</p>
<p>Many arithmetic instructions can take an immediate value as the first operand. The immediate value is fixed (not variable), and is coded into the instruction itself. Immediate values are prefixed with <code>$</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><code>movl $0xFF, %esi</code> means <code>esi = 0xFF;</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>addl $-2, %edi</code> means <code>edi = edi + (-2);</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p><code>shrl $3, %edx</code> means <code>edx = edx &gt;&gt; 3;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>movl</code> instruction copies the value from the first argument to the second argument (it does not strictly “move”, but this is the customary name). In the case of registers, like <code>movl %eax, %ebx</code>, this means to copy the value of the <code>eax</code> register into <code>ebx</code> (which overwrites <code>ebx</code>’s previous value).</p>

<h3>An aside</h3>
<p>Now is a good time to talk about one principle in assembly programming: Not every desirable operation is directly expressible in one instruction. In typical programming languages that most people use, many constructs are composable and adaptable to different situations, and arithmetic can be nested. In assembly language however, you can only write what the instruction set allows. To illustrate with examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You can’t add two immediate constants together, even though you can in C. In assembly you’d either compute the value at compile time, or express it as a sequence of instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can add two 32-bit registers in one instruction, but you can’t add three 32-bit registers – you’d need to break it up into two instructions.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can’t add a 16-bit register to a 32-bit register. You’d need to write one instruction to perform a 16-to-32-bit widening conversion, and another instruction to perform the addition.</p></li>
	<li><p>When performing bit shifting, the shift count must be either a hard-coded immediate value or the register <code>cl</code>. It cannot be any other register. If the shift count was in another register, then the value needs to be copied to <code>cl</code> first.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway messages are that you shouldn’t try to guess or invent syntaxes that don’t exist (such as <code>addl %eax, %ebx, %ecx</code>); also that if you can’t find a desired instruction in the long list of supported instructions then you need to manually implement it as a sequence of instructions (and possibly allocate some temporary registers to store intermediate values).</p>

<h2 id="4-flags-register-and-comparisons">4. Flags register and comparisons</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/eflags-register.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>There is a 32-bit register named <code>eflags</code> which is <em>implicitly</em> read or written in many instructions. In other words, its value plays a role in the instruction execution, but the register is not mentioned in the assembly code.</p>
<p>Arithmetic instructions such as <code>addl</code> usually update <code>eflags</code> based on the computed result. The instruction would set or clear flags like carry (CF), overflow (OF), sign (SF), parity (PF), zero (ZF), etc. Some instructions read the flags – for example <code>adcl</code> adds two numbers and uses the carry flag as a third operand: <code>adcl %ebx, %eax</code> means <code>eax = eax + ebx + cf;</code>. Some instructions set a register based on a flag – for example <code>setz %al</code> sets the 8-bit register <code>al</code> to 0 if ZF is clear or 1 if ZF is set. Some instructions directly affect a single flag bit, such as <code>cld</code> clearing the direction flag (DF).</p>
<p>Comparison instructions affect <code>eflags</code> without changing any general-purpose registers. For example, <code>cmpl %eax, %ebx</code> will compare the two registers’ value by subtracting them in an unnamed temporary place and set the flags according to the result, so that you can tell whether <code>eax &lt; ebx</code> or <code>eax == ebx</code> or <code>eax &gt; ebx</code> in either unsigned mode or signed mode. Similarly, <code>testl %eax, %ebx</code> computes <code>eax &amp; ebx</code> in a temporary place and sets the flags accordingly. Most of the time, the instruction after a comparison is a conditional jump (covered later).</p>
<p>So far, we know that some flag bits are related to arithmetic operations. Other flag bits are concerned with how the CPU behaves – such as whether to accept hardware interrupts, virtual 8086 mode, and other system management stuff that is mostly of concern to OS developers, not to application developers. For the most part, the <code>eflags</code> register is largely ignorable. The system flags are definitely ignorable, and the arithmetic flags can be forgotten except for comparisons and bigint arithmetic operations.</p>

<h2 id="5-memory-addressing-reading-writing">5. Memory addressing, reading, writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/ram-as-byte-array.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>The CPU by itself does not make a very useful computer. Having only 8 data registers severely limits what computations you can do because you can’t store much information. To augment the CPU, we have <abbr title="random access memory">RAM</abbr> as a large system memory. Basically, RAM is an enormous array of bytes – for example, 128 <abbr title="mebibytes">MiB</abbr> of RAM is 134&nbsp;217&nbsp;728 bytes that you can store any values to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming/little-endian.svg" alt=""></a>
</p>
<p>When storing a value longer than a byte, the value is encoded in little endian. For example if a 32-bit register contained the value 0xDEADBEEF and this register needs to be stored in memory starting at address 10, then the byte value 0xEF goes into RAM address 10, 0xBE into address 11, 0xAD into address 12, and finally …</p></article></div>

            <p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> has become the de facto solution for
managing X.509 certificates for applications running in Kubernetes. The project, <a href="https://www.jetstack.io/blog/cert-manager-cncf/">now part of the CNCF Sandbox</a>, was built with flexibility and extensibility in mind. It allows operators to use Certificates and Issuers as first-class citizens in the API, and for this to enable almost any use case in which an automated certificate is required.</p>
<p>As Kubernetes adoption grows, there is now increased interest in service mesh to securely connect workloads, as well as provide dynamic configuration of traffic routing and consistent observability. Services meshes typically use X.509 certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS), with the identity encoded using <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFFE</a>.</p>
<p>With a range of supported certificate issuers, there has been interest from the community to see Istio integrated with cert-manager for it to provide signing capabilities for workloads. Working with the Security WG in the Istio community, as well as a number of our customers, the cert-manager team at Jetstack have built an integration that enables cert-manager to sign workload certificates in an Istio service mesh.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="rise-of-the-service-mesh">Rise of the service mesh</h2>
<p><a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> is a popular, fully-featured service mesh; it has a rich set of configurations for traffic
routing, policy control, and observability. Like most service meshes, the data plane is powered by <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and each workload running in the mesh will have
one of these proxies that intercept all traffic, and make routing decisions
based upon the mesh configuration as a whole.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing certificates, service meshes typically ship with a limited number of Certificate
Authority (CA) choices, those being either self signed, perhaps
<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>, and sometimes an integration with a
cloud provider solution. This imposes limitations on <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> your certificates get signed. These limitations can
be problematic for larger enterprises where there are requirements for using
particular CAs, auditing and visibility of these signed certificates, as well as
the headaches that come with changing the Certificate Authority already used in
production.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-cert-manager">Why use cert-manager?</h2>
<p>cert-manager is commonly used to secure ingresses, in conjunction with an Ingress controller (NGINX, for example) and a public CA such as Let’s Encrypt. You can use cert-manager with Istio today to secure ingress using the Istio Gateway (<a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/certmanager/">guide</a>), but up until now it’s not been straightforward to use for issuance and renewal of <em>workload certificates</em>.</p>
<p>cert-manager was always built to be CA-agnostic and enable integration with both public <em>and</em> private CAs. The project and wider ecosystem has a wide choice of public and private CA providers available
for certificate signing. There are internal issuers core to the project, including HashiCorp Vault, and a fast-growing set of <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External Issuers</a> that should cover many bases, including cloud provider PKI services. It’s also simple enough to build on cert-manager and develop your own external issuer if you’ve a more bespoke requirement.</p>
<p>A further benefit of using cert-manager is its centralised API and consistent interface. This means that
swapping out an issuer, say to use a different CA provider, is fairly trivial. This operation only requires a change to the
<a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/">Issuer</a> configuration and issuer
that the mesh is configured to use - the rest is all handled by cert-manager.</p>
<p>By using cert-manager as the single tool for managing certificates in the
cluster, operators are able to have complete visibility of the machine identities with a single pane of glass,
for auditing, policy and observability purposes (and if that sounds useful, check out our
<a href="https://www.jetstack.io/jetstack-secure/">Jetstack Secure</a> service - it’s free to get started).</p>
<h2 id="machine-identity-lifecycle-in-an-istio-service-mesh">Machine identity lifecycle in an Istio service mesh</h2>
<p>When a workload starts, along with its sidecar, it needs to identify itself to
the mesh control plane, and retrieve a signed certificate in order to begin
sending traffic over the network. A helper executable called the <code>istio-agent</code> is
responsible for retrieving this signed certificate, and delivering it to Envoy to use.
This involves sending a certificate signing request to the control
plane component of Istio (<code>istiod</code>), along with the pod’s Service Account token
to securely identity itself. Once <code>istiod</code> has validated the request, it will in
the default case, sign and send back a certificate trusted by the mesh that
Envoy can begin to serve and send traffic.</p>
<h3 id="how-weve-integrated-cert-manager">How we’ve integrated cert-manager</h3>
<p>The cert-manager integration with Istio involves running a separate
component to <code>istiod</code>. The <code>cert-manager-istio-agent</code> processes certificate requests from istio-agents in the mesh.The agent will verify the identity, using the incoming Service Account token and ensure the
certificate signing request matches that identity, kicking off a
<code>CertiticateRequest</code> flow with cert-manager. This involves cert-manager watching
for the <code>CertiticateRequest</code> created, and signing it using the Issuer installed
and referenced on the request. Once signed, the certificate is returned back to
the <code>istio-agent</code> to facilitate mTLS in the mesh.</p>

  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6b47e30230d9fc89c785f8c98365e571c105d60a/351b2/blog/cert-manager-istio-integration/diagram.png" alt="cert-manager istio agent">
</figure>
<p>This agent is responsible for distributing the trust chain of the configured
Issuer, along with signing certificates for all workloads running in the
cluster.</p>
<p>Using the <code>istio-csr</code> project, you can integrate any of cert-manager’s Issuers and have this
provide certificate signing for workloads in the mesh. With more <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/">External
Issuers</a>, such as the
<a href="https://github.com/jetstack/google-cas-issuer">Google CAS Issuer</a>, being added
to the cert-manager ecosystem all the time, it allows certificates in all areas
of the cluster be signed from any number of centralised CAs that best suits
your needs, whilst ensuring the portability that the cert-manager API provides.</p>
<h4 id="not-using-istio">Not using Istio?</h4>
<p>In the CNCF, the <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd project</a> already provides <a href="https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/automatically-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/#cert-manager-as-an-on-cluster-ca">cert-manager integration</a>. Jetstack has also integrated Open Service Mesh (OSM), a new service mesh from Microsoft in the CNCF Sandbox - (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyddzt4oqLM&amp;list=PLeFOFE7BDgi0-VnLT8jPUWZF9m-zntrd_&amp;index=2&amp;utm_source=jetstack&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=community-day-videos">see this video</a> for a talk featuring a demo).</p>

Payload—a self-hosted Node, Express and React-based headless CMS, is now available.</h3></p></div><p>Hi—my name is James and I’m one of the founders of Payload CMS. After two years of development and thousands of commits, I am extremely excited to announce that Payload CMS is now available to the public. It’s our response to the surprisingly sparse JavaScript CMS market and we hope that its arrival improves the development workflow of engineers all over the world.</p><p>Payload has already been put through the test with an array of pilot projects that ranged from video game backend to full e-commerce store development, virtual event platform, and more. Through the projects we’ve released with Payload thus far, our own team’s efficiency has absolutely skyrocketed and we’re confident that it’s only going to get better from here.</p><h5>Now, we’re finally ready to open up to the community.</h5><p>We would greatly appreciate if you were to install Payload, give it a shot, and let us know what you think. Any type of feedback is welcome - be it about how we write our docs, about your experience using Payload in your projects, or anything else!</p><p id="we-needed-a-cms-that-didnt-exist"><h2>We needed a CMS that didn’t exist</h2></p><p>We built Payload because, over the years, my team and I have come to understand exactly what we need out of a CMS to build projects—big or small—for our clients:</p><p id="1-self-hosted"><h3>1. Self-hosted.</h3></p><p>What happens when your hosted CMS doesn’t offer you just that <em>one</em> thing that you need, so you need to end up opening a REST endpoint to build it? Guess it’s time to maintain your own server or Lambda function. Seems like a racket when you could have just used a self-hosted CMS in the first place and had a server set up already. We’ve been there too many times to let that keep happening.</p><p>Third-party hosted CMS might work for simple sites where you know you’ll be able to work within their confines for the lifetime of the app, or for strictly delivering content and not ever having to worry about receiving content, but when your needs become any more advanced, a self-hosted CMS that provides you with complete control is the way to go.</p><p>Security is also a concern with third-party hosted CMS solutions. <a href="https://trbl.design/">My digital design firm TRBL</a> works with many clients that are heavily security-focused and want to maintain complete control over their databases and infrastructure. Many of them deploy their CMS within their own private networks—only accessible via VPN or similar. For these clients, maintaining control over their own code is an absolute necessity, which removes many popular third-party hosted CMS from the equation.</p><p>Find out how to install Payload by <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation">heading to our Docs</a>.</p><p id="2-customizable-react-admin-panel"><h3>2. Customizable React admin panel.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS’ admin panel to be minimal, understandable, and most of all, <strong>completely customizable</strong>. If we need to customize a field type, we should be able to swap in our own React field component to take the place of a default text input, for example. We definitely don’t want to jump through any hoops, either, like dealing with messy iFrames or separately developed field type packages.</p><p>If we want to add a view, we should be able to build a React component and add it as a view. If we want to be able to customize the CMS’ branding, and completely white-label the CMS, we should be able to.</p><div><p><img src="https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png" alt="Payload headless CMS Admin UI built in React JS"></p><p>[Screenshot of the Payload Admin panel, editing a document from an Order collection]</p></div><p id="3-block-based-field-editor"><h3>3. Block-based field editor.</h3></p><p>My team and I design entire sites and apps with a component mentality—even down to how page layouts are assembled. Through UX design phases, we identify all the layout building “blocks” that are necessary to build and then we design our CMS to allow for content editors to self-craft their page layouts using the deliberately designed layout blocks that we’ve provided them with.  We then map each “block” in the CMS to React components that have props matching 1:1 to the fields within the CMS block. Boom, component-based layout building.</p><p>Like so many others, we started off years ago using WP and Advanced Custom Fields. ACF’s Flexible Content field type is great for layout building. But unfortunately, many other CMS have a complete lack of any layout-building workflow, and even when it’s supported, it lacks functionality or is a shoe-horned solution.</p><h5>Conditional Logic</h5><p>Another thing my team always took for granted in ACF that’s missing from other CMS completely is field-level conditional logic (show this field if another field has a value equal to <code>true</code> and similar). Our ideal CMS needs to have a built-in way to deliver dynamic interfaces that respond to input accordingly. Such a simple feature makes complex content management so much easier.</p><p id="4-javascript-top-to-bottom"><h3>4. JavaScript top to bottom.</h3></p><p>When’s the last time you worked on a web project without a <code>package.json</code>? Even if you work in PHP, you’re likely going to unavoidably need Node too. The idea of flattening our stack entirely into one language and not having to run a Docker container just to get a local LAMP environment going is a nice one indeed. We want to simplify our stack and keep it all JS. Better yet, TypeScript.</p><p id="5-reusable-secure-authentication"><h3>5. Reusable, secure authentication.</h3></p><p>One of the toughest parts about content management systems in-general is that they perform a lot of the lifting that a typical application framework would also need, but fall dramatically short of being able to call themselves an app framework through and through because of their lack of support for reusable authentication. For example, if you wanted to build a full SaaS product, you might need to create products, users, licenses, pages, and maybe even blog posts. Any run-of-the-mill CMS might get you close to being able to CRUD all of this stuff within its system, but what about user authentication? What about having control over users’ access? You’d be more often than not left to fend for yourself. Commonly you’d end up with either rolling your own system from scratch or building out a patchwork of separate systems (and separate admin UIs) to manage the product.</p><p>We need a CMS that comes with robust and reusable authentication right out of the box, so we can leverage the CMS for all our commonly needed authentication functionality. This way, we can keep all of our logic organized and build fully-featured apps right in our CMS that we’ve become accustomed to.</p><p>This way, if a client of ours comes to us asking for a simple app or a marketing site, but in the future, decides that they need to add full e-commerce support, we won’t end up with a messy disconnected set of admin UIs for them to manage their single product within. It can all be done in Payload.</p><h5>Payload's Authentication Operations</h5><p>In addition to just being able to log in and log out, Payload ships with everything a fully-featured app needs when it comes to authentication:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-registration</strong></li><li><strong>Login</strong></li><li><strong>Logout</strong></li><li><strong>Refresh token functionality</strong></li><li><strong>Forgot Password / Reset Password</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic locking of accounts on X number of failed password attempts</strong></li><li><strong>Email verification on new account creation</strong></li></ul><p>Payload supports as many authentication-ready collections as you need—meaning you could easily maintain a collection of Admins as well as a collection of Customers—each storing separate information and having separate access control to your documents.</p><h5>Payload's Access Control</h5><p>One of the best parts about Payload is its <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview">function-based Access Control</a>. Right in your configs, you define who can access what documents via extremely simple and straightforward Access Control functions.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example of an Orders collection with fine-tuned Access Control:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> Orders </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  access</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>create</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>          owner</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> equals</span><span>:</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>update</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>delete</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="6-uploads-with-local-storage"><h3>6. Uploads with local storage.</h3></p><p>Other existing CMS provide integrations to third-party file storage solutions, but those come with an additional cost, and one more third-party dependency to maintain. We want to be able to store our own file uploads, in our own contexts. If we want to ship them off to AWS S3 or similar after they’re uploaded locally—then so be it. They should be our files first though. And uploading should be simple to configure.</p><p id="7-code-based"><h3>7. Code-based.</h3></p><p>We used the ACF GUI for a while, but then realized we could be much more deliberate if we stored our ACF configs right in the PHP of our site. It was super nice to have written them, understood the code, and have them checked in directly to our repositories. Having our schemas so close to our code made referencing them significantly easier. Nowadays, we don’t find value from GUI schema designers and would rather just write them in code, pending the syntax is concise enough.</p><p id="8-maintain-your-own-express-server"><h3>8. Maintain your own Express server.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS with the right level of abstraction. That means giving us the functionality we know we won’t ever need to change, like auth and file upload, while also giving us the freedom to do what we need to do unhindered by a big lumbering framework whose docs are written for people that have Ph.Ds in Computer Science.  If we could keep our hands on our own Express server, then we could do whatever we need to do however we need to do it, outside of the CMS. Plus, if we could keep our own Express server, we could combine a CMS with a SSR framework like NextJS if we wanted to. One command, spin up Next and the CMS at once.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example for how Payload ties in to your existing Express server:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> payload </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'payload'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> express </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'express'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>payload</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  secret</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  mongoURL</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'mongodb://localhost/payload'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  express</span><span>:</span><span> app</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Application listening on </span><span>${</span><span>3000</span><span>}</span><span>...</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="9-localization-support"><h3>9.

Eventually, we may even become the go-to person on our team or in our organization, seen as the technical guru of our field.</p><p id="bd7c">At this level, we get a self-esteem boost, which is positive. But at times we may fall into the trap of getting an unnecessary ego. The wrong mindset creeps in, which can lead to the beginning of our downfall.</p><p id="8035">I’ve been through that journey. So I now consciously remind myself not to fall into one of those mindsets again. We’ll talk about three of them.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="fdb9">I once saw a tweet from a person who claimed his father (a programmer) offered to teach him how to code, and he rejected it. The author of the tweet is now a developer, describing himself as a self-taught programmer.</p><p id="e3c4">Programming isn’t a skill one can master completely by simply taking a course or getting a degree. A lot of sweat and time spent digging and learning is needed to build one’s competency.</p><p id="a45d">It’s not a field that can be effectively explored and fully discovered alone. We might not have a personal mentor and we may not have taken any formal courses, but that doesn’t change the fact that we still learn by reading from somewhere — whether that be a book, tutorial, blog, manual, or even Stack Overflow. All these things were written by someone.</p><p id="6607">In fact, the best way to learn programming is by working with a group of developers — through code reviews, pairings, constant discussion, and the exchange of ideas and the information learned. Attending conferences, guilds, dojos, etc. helps too.</p><p id="739c">Therefore, much of what we’ve learned and where we are today isn’t a result of our self-meditation on a mountain. Instead, it’s an accumulated assimilation of the knowledge and experience others have shared with us, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="cc5a">We should always be grateful.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="0edf">Someone responded to one of my past blogs saying, “The young ones can’t concentrate. And their productivity is vastly lower than that of us oldsters. Their code quality is way lower.” I felt disgusted by this blanket statement targeting young programmers, even if I’m not the young one.</p><p id="c651">We learn, we grow, we age. With the advantage of time, we sometimes gain an upper hand in terms of both knowledge and experience in some area.</p><p id="10db">However, software development is an ever-changing field. One needs to continue learning to keep abreast of a skill. Over time, some of the past knowledge we acquired and spent time on is no longer relevant. When you consider what’s still relevant, the knowledge gap between older and younger programmers becomes smaller.</p><p id="15b7">At times, some area of knowledge younger programmers have might surpass us, the older folks (I consider myself an <em>older folk</em>, having worked for more than two decades). In software development, there’s been so much new knowledge to harvest in the last 10 years, and it’s not possible for us to extract it all.</p><p id="0b17">Never look down on the young ones. Respect each other, and always shamelessly ask and listen to their opinion. Be open. Avoid impostor syndrome. We might be surprised to learn a lot from those younger than us.</p><p id="28f9">The young ones are the future. They’ll shape the world one day. Teach them as much as you can, and also learn from them as much as you can. We’re not always right.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e916">“What more is there to learn within programming? Everything new is just an old thing with a different look — or it’s just <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>for</code> loops covered by fancier names and structures externally.” I thought this back then after I’ve mastered C++ and object-oriented programming.</p><p id="0a2f">I despised Java as an inferior language to C++ and looked down on all scripts — VBScript, JavaScript, and let’s not forget HTML, which isn’t even a language to me. Python, what is it? No <code>{}</code> and, it’s optional to use <code>;</code>? Using indentation is a must??</p><p id="f535">The word<em> evolve </em>meant nothing to me, and after a decade, Python became the most used language.</p><p id="1213">I still have the utmost respect for those with competency in C programming, having the ability to work with pointers, having proper memory management, and writing code that compiles into the smallest and most efficient executable.</p><p id="e21a">However, that’s no longer what mainstream software development looks like. Web programming took the world by storm in the ‘90s and early 2000s. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile development has become a significant player in software development. And now artificial intelligence could be the next wave, which the Python language plays a significant role in enabling.</p><p id="11c4">Fast forward to today: Now I’m getting my feet wet in mobile development, a rapidly changing field. I just realized how wrong I was back then in despising the newer yet seemingly inferior product (i.e., Java) over what I’d mastered (i.e., C++). Java has influenced many of the programming languages we have today, and its JVM is the backbone of many new languages (e.g., Scala and Kotlin).</p><p id="97ef">Never despise newer tech at a glance. It’s true most of them spawn from an existing tech and may look similar (or at times even inferior), but all of these small little changes could contribute to the next leap of change.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7126">In the early years of my career, I worked hard and was promoted fast. My boss jokingly gave me a little advice, “Don’t get cocky.” I guess that about sums it all up.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

</p>

<p>Because of the big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach">SolarWinds hack</a> and the recent blog post describing a new <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a>, there has been a lot of talk lately about supply chain attacks, the sneaky technique of compromising less secure elements in a supply chain to compromise more secure targets.</p>

<p>A popular target for supply chain attacks has always been the many package management systems for popular programming languages such as NPM for JavaScript, Rubygems for Ruby, and PyPI for Python. These systems have been plagued for years by malicious actors uploading malicious packages and waiting for victims to install them.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard much talk about how the situation looks for the Go ecosystem, and since Go is my new language of choice, I decided to do some investigation.</p>

<p>The novel <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion attack</a> vector is luckily not something a Go developer has to worry about since the source is always explicitly specified when importing a package, so when Go fetches the external dependency, it can’t be confused about where to fetch it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"github.com/stretchr/testify"</span>

<p>There is however still a possible attack vector via simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting">typosquatting</a> where the attacker exploits the fact that people often hit the wrong keys when typing on their keyboard. This could both be done on the host domain where the attacker registers a common typo of github.com, but even easier would be to simply register a new user on GitHub, or any other open package host, with a common typo of the package owner’s username.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I set out to build a tool that would help me uncover potential typosquat packages in the wild:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a large list of Go package import paths (e.g. <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code>)</li>
  <li>Permutate the username of every unique package owner to get a list of potential typosquats</li>
  <li>Check if any of the typosquat users exists on the platform</li>
  <li>If a potential typosquat user is found, retrieve all of their repositories</li>
  <li>Log any of the repositories that have a name equal to the original packages being checked</li>
</ol>

<p>This resulted in a new tool I call <code>pkgtwist</code> which is <a href="https://gitlab.com/michenriksen/pkgtwist">available on GitLab</a> (the name is inspired by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist">dnstwist</a> tool)  if you are interested in doing your own evil Go package hunting.</p>

<h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2>

<p>Probably the most important part of <code>pkgtwist</code> was the generation of good username permutations in order to have the best chance of detecting typosquats. A bit of research led me to <a href="https://github.com/zntrio/typogenerator">zntrio/typogenerater</a> which looked like the perfect package for generating potential username typos. The package implements a pretty long list of permutation strategies that I picked a few from so that pkgtwist only spends time on checking what I feel are the most likely typosquats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Omission:</strong> removal of a single character (missing a keypress, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strechr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> repetition of characters (pressing a key twice, <code>gobuffalo</code> =&gt; <code>gobuffallo</code>)</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitsquatting">Bitsquatting</a>:</strong> possible bit-flip errors (<code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strftchr</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Transposition:</strong> swapping of adjacent characters (pressing keys in the wrong order, <code>stretchr</code> =&gt; <code>strethcr</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that if pkgtwist is given the package <code>github.com/stretchr/testify</code> as input, it will check if any of the of following users exist on GitHub, and if they do, check if they have also have a repository called <code>testify</code>:</p>

<p><code>tretchr</code> <code>sretchr</code> <code>stetchr</code> <code>strtchr</code> <code>strechr</code> <code>strethr</code> <code>stretcr</code> <code>stretch</code> <code>sstretchr</code> <code>sttretchr</code> <code>strretchr</code> <code>streetchr</code> <code>strettchr</code> <code>stretcchr</code> <code>stretchhr</code> <code>stretchrr</code> <code>rtretchr</code> <code>qtretchr</code> <code>ptretchr</code> <code>wtretchr</code> <code>vtretchr</code> <code>utretchr</code> <code>ttretchr</code> <code>suretchr</code> <code>svretchr</code> <code>swretchr</code> <code>spretchr</code> <code>sqretchr</code> <code>srretchr</code> <code>ssretchr</code> <code>stsetchr</code> <code>stpetchr</code> <code>stqetchr</code> <code>stvetchr</code> <code>stwetchr</code> <code>sttetchr</code> <code>stuetchr</code> <code>strdtchr</code> <code>strgtchr</code> <code>strftchr</code> <code>stratchr</code> <code>strctchr</code> <code>strbtchr</code> <code>streuchr</code> <code>strevchr</code> <code>strewchr</code> <code>strepchr</code> <code>streqchr</code> <code>strerchr</code> <code>streschr</code> <code>stretbhr</code> <code>stretahr</code> <code>stretghr</code> <code>stretfhr</code> <code>stretehr</code> <code>stretdhr</code> <code>stretcir</code> <code>stretcjr</code> <code>stretckr</code> <code>stretclr</code> <code>stretcmr</code> <code>stretcnr</code> <code>stretcor</code> <code>stretchs</code> <code>stretchp</code> <code>stretchq</code> <code>stretchv</code> <code>stretchw</code> <code>stretcht</code> <code>stretchu</code> <code>tsretchr</code> <code>srtetchr</code> <code>stertchr</code> <code>strtechr</code> <code>strecthr</code> <code>strethcr</code> <code>stretcrh</code></p>

<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>

<p>Next up was to find a list of packages to check. Initially, I thought about finding some sort of “Top X Go packages” list, but I couldn’t really find a good resource for that, so I ended up running pkgtwist against every github.com and gitlab.com hosted packages from the <a href="https://index.golang.org/index">Go Module Index</a> (731 packages in all).</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/pkgtwist_1.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>pkgtwist running in verbose mode.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>After several hours of crunching through the 731 packages, pkgtwist finished with a list of 7 potential typosquat packages to investigate further. I honestly expected the list to be bigger, but I was of course happy to see that the Go ecosystem isn’t completely infested (yet) with malicious typosquat packages.</p>

<p>There were however a couple of typosquat packages that jumped out at me…</p>

<h3 id="githubcomsiruspenlogrus-️">github.com/siruspen/logrus ⚠️</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/">logrus</a> package by <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen">sirupsen</a> is a very popular logging package (17.3k stars on GitHub) that many Go projects use, which obviously makes it a target for a typosquat supply chain attack. So when I saw that the user <code>siruspen</code> (notice the letter swapping) had a similarly named repository, I quickly checked out what it was doing.</p>

<p>It turns out that the project is a fork of the original <code>logrus</code> repository, so doing a comparison to find the differences was pretty easy. At the time of writing, the only thing that is added to the potential typosquat repository, <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/compare/master...siruspen:master#diff-ff87b7c4777a35588053a509583d66c9f404ccbea9e1c71d2a5f224d7ad1323eR13-R16">is a small init function</a> with a single <code>Println</code> call:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/siruspen_logrus.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Comparing siruspen/logrus with the original repository.</figcaption>
</div>

<p>While this is not malicious in any way it could very quickly be changed by the owner in the future, so I will definitely keep an eye on this repository. I would also recommend double-checking your projects if you use <code>logrus</code> to make sure you’re not using this package instead of the real one!</p>

<h3 id="githubcomutfavecli-️">github.com/utfave/cli ⚠️</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/urfave/cli">urfave/cli</a> is another popular Go package (15.4k stars on GitHub) for building CLI projects. So when I saw the user <code>utfave</code> also had a repository called <code>cli</code>, my alarm bells went off and I investigated further.</p>

<p>It turns out that the <a href="https://github.com/utfave/cli/commit/4af15496c49f613503d37d43b99df767f831bae1#diff-8d9ca23280f24fe6444d03ae46e7a15dd152170f32f57f978dfbdfd3cfe8ff55L26-R36">second-last commit</a> introduces a highly suspicious <code>init</code> function:</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png"><img src="https://michenriksen.com/assets/images/pkgtwist/utfave_cli.png" alt=""></a></p><figcaption>Ohai there, 122.51.124.140...</figcaption>
</div>

<p>It looks like the author <code>utfave</code> wants to know the hostname, operating system, and architecture of all the machines using their version of <code>urfave/cli</code>. The function extracts the system information and then calls out to the IP address <code>122.51.124.140</code> belonging to the Chinese company Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems via HTTP with the system information added as URL parameters.</p>

<p>While this code won’t give them any access to systems, it’s highly suspicious that they collect this information and the actor can quickly change this code to call back with a reverse shell if they identify a system to be valuable or interesting.</p>

<p>I reported this repository to GitHub and hope to see it taken down in the near future. Until then, I recommend double-checking your projects if you use the <code>urfave/cli</code> to make sure you’re not using the typosquatted version.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While my little research project didn’t cover every single Go package out there, I feel it covered enough to give a rough picture of what the supply chain attack situation looks like for the Go ecosystem. The two repositories <code>siruspen/logrus</code> and <code>utfave/cli</code>, were the only ones out of the 7 flagged repos that really worried me, but I will keep a close eye on the rest as they could in theory become malicious at any time.</p>

<p>I think Go is in a better situation than other programming languages because the source of packages is always explicitly written every time they are used, but code editor automation could make typosquat attacks more likely to happen as the developer doesn’t write the import paths manually as often. As an example, if the popular <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go">Go extension</a> for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is installed, a developer will typically only type a package import on the first usage, and then the editor will automatically add the import in any other files as soon as the package name is used. If the developer mistypes the import path the first time, a malicious package could be introduced and live for a long time in a Go project before it’s discovered.</p>

<p>In this article, we set up <em>limiters</em> in order to equitably distribute the bandwidth of our Internet connection among all the users of our local network.</p>



<h2>What are <em>Limiters</em>?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a purpose.<br>A limiter can be used to limit traffic to a specific IP address or subnet, to limit traffic for a specific type of service (e.g. e-mail, web, …) or to distribute traffic equitably among several users.</p>



<p>Typical uses of limiters are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>limit the Internet bandwidth of user X to 1 Mbps ;</li><li>distribute equitably 10 Mbps of bandwidth between all the users of the “LAN” network;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the “OPT” network to a total of 5 Mbps;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the FTP protocol to 2 Mbps.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a usage</strong>.<br>At the opposite, traffic shaping (like CBQ) allows to guarantee a minimum bandwidth.</p>



<h2>How limiters work?</h2>



<p>The implementation of the limiters is done in 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>creating <strong>limiter</strong> itself: it’s a pipe with a maximum bandwidth which operates globally or by group of IP addresses;</li><li>creating assignment <strong>rules</strong>: which traffic will be limited by which pipe.</li></ul>



<p>Limiters are usually created in pairs: one limiter for incoming traffic (Download) and one limiter for outgoing traffic (Upload).</p>



<p>Limiters are organized hierarchically: a root limiter (also called a pipe), with a bandwidth and a latency, and on the other hand child limiters (called queues) with a weight (i.e. a priority).</p>



<h2>Use case: distribute Internet bandwidth equitably</h2>



<p>In this article we work with the following case study: we have an Internet connection with a download speed of 200 Mbps and an upload speed of 50 Mbps.<br>We want to share dynamically this bandwidth between all users.</p>



<p>If we have 2 users connected at the same time, they will each have 100 Mbps for download and 25 Mbps for upload at the maximum.<br>If we have 10 users connected at the same time, they will each have 20 Mbps for download and 5 Mbps for upload at the maximum.</p>



<p>pfSense will manage this equitable distribution automatically and dynamically as we go.</p>



<p>The network diagram is as follows:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="718" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png 501w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"><figcaption>Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start the configuration!</p>



<h2>1. Create the upload <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We create 2 root limiters: one for upload and one for download.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="156" height="238" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-traffic-shaper-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the <strong>Limiters</strong> tab, click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the pipe and its queues.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the pipe (alphanumeric characters and underscore only). In our case, we call it “<strong>Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: the bandwidth of the pipe. Note that we can define a bandwidth according to a schedule (“Schedule” option). In our case, we choose “50 Mbps”.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: this parameter allows to define how the limitation will be applied to the traffic. 3 choices are available:<ul><li><span>none</span>: the limitation will apply to all traffic as a single set. In our case, this is what we choose (we want the whole outgoing traffic to be limited to 50 Mbps).</li><li><span>Source addresses</span>: the limitation will apply per source IP address (or group of source IP addresses, depending on the mask). So, to perform a limitation by IP address of a network, we choose “Source addresses” and specify a /32 mask. This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Upload pipe.</li><li><span>Destination addresses</span>: the limitation will apply by destination IP address (or group of destination IP addresses, depending on the mask). This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Download pipe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: allows to set advanced parameters such as latency or packet loss rate. These parameters are useful to simulate bad Internet connections (or to make a bad joke to a colleague…). We won’t use it in our case, but the name of each field speaks for itself.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="963" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x295.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x755.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point we have a pipe that will allow us to limit our traffic to a maximum bandwidth of 50 Mbps.</p>



<p>The next step is to create a queue linked to this pipe and specify that this queue will be applicable per user.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the page of the limiter we just created, we click on the “+ Add new Queue” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the queue.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the queue. In our case, we call it “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: the mask to be applied. In our case, we choose “Source addresses”. We want to apply this limitation for each user, i.e. per source IP address, so we choose “32” as mask size.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: weight ranging from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority). For a fair distribution of the bandwidth of the root limiter, this field can be left empty. If we want to give more bandwidth to some users than to others, then we have to play with this value. In our case, we leave the field empty (the distribution will be fair between users).</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: we leave these fields empty.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="802" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x246.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our limiters (pipe and queue) are ready for outgoing (upload) traffic.</p>



<p>We still have to do the same configuration for incoming (download) traffic.</p>



<h2>2. Create the download <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The pipe configuration is the same as for the upload pipe.<br>You just have to think about choosing the right bandwidth (in our case, 200 Mbps) and changing its name (in our case, we call it “Download”).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="910" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 977w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x279.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for the upload pipe, we create a queue: click on the button “+ Add new Queue”.</p>



<p>The configuration is almost the same as for the upload queue.<br>The difference is in the choice for the “Mask” option. Choose “Destination addresses”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="798" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x245.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The limiters are created:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="123" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiters-list-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Limiters tree</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>3. Modify firewall rules</h2>



<p>The last step is to configure the firewall to associate traffic with limiters.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Rules:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="241" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Choose the LAN tab and edit each filtering rule for Internet access.</p>



<p>On each rule, go to the advanced options (“Display Advanced” button):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="244" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png 405w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Advanced Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the bottom of the page, for the “In / Out pipe” option, choose “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>” for the first drop-down list and “<strong>LAN_Download</strong>” for the second:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="126" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png 791w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-300x48.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-768x122.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"><figcaption>[pfSense] In / Out pipe (limiters)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to perform this manipulation on all the rules concerned.</p>



<p>The traffic limitation per user is in place!</p>



<h2>4. Check the service</h2>



<p>To check that the limiters are working properly, navigate to Diagnostics &gt; Limiter Info.<br>Each pipe and its queues is presented in text format with its parameters and values.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-03-01</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2021-03-02</span>.</p>
<p>Are you a JavaScript framework or library fan-boy? One of those frontend developers who cannot figure out how to build a website without completely smothering and drowning everything in JavaScript? Well, if you are, let me share a JavaScript nightmare with you!</p>

<p>These last couple of days I have been working for a company that contacted me because they where suffering from some "hacking" problems on their website. The company is run by two hardworking entrepreneurs, who know a lot about how to run a successful business, but close to nothing about computer related security.</p>

<p>These guys naturally trusted their entire IT infrastructure to a couple of external IT companies and they also used a couple of one-man freelance developers for different smaller tasks.</p>

<p>It is a real shame, but I must admit that I am not surprised at my findings. None of these IT companies or one-man freelance developers had the least knowledge about security. What they did is just about what everyone else is doing these days - blindly following hype and trends!</p>

<p><img src="http://unixsheikh.com/includes/images/blind-following.jpg" alt="Drawing of people blindly following other people"><br><strong>Monkey see, monkey do - blind following</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to skip ahead because the complexity of the problems are almost too difficult to describe, but let's just say that everything is a mess! From how the computers at the office are being used, to the implemented password policy, to lacking firewall implementations, to yes, just about everything is a problem. However, despite multiple possible attack vectors can you guess where the attackers actually have chosen to focus their payload?</p>

<p><b>JavaScript obfuscated malware</b>.</p>

<p>I would have expected that the websites would be infested with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shells</a>, SPAM bots, cross site scripting, and all the other "good stuff", but no.</p>

<p>The company has more than one website, but all are of those kinds that are drowning in unneeded JavaScript from head to toe. Absolutely nothing works on these websites without all of this JavaScript crap - yet, absolutely nothing of what the JavaScript is doing is truly needed or even useful!</p>

<p>As I was going through the code, trying very hard to figure out what was going on in this JavaScript nightmare, I eventually had to give up. It would literally take weeks, if not months to de-obfuscate everything and figure out what was legitimate usage and what was malware.</p>

<p>And that's typical of todays web developers. I cannot count the number of sites I have seen that is filled with utterly useless JavaScript functionality.</p>

<p><strong>And I'm sick of it!</strong></p>

<p>If you're a frontend developer reading this, and you're a JavaScript fan-boy, <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">Stop pushing JavaScript!</a></p>

<p>As a frontend developer you're responsible for your client and their customers. Your stupid JavaScript is a prime target for inserting obfuscated malware so you better make sure it is truly needed, and you better make sure that it is easy to validate!</p>

<p><strong>We don't need JavaScript for the majority of websites on the Internet! It's causing much more harm than good!</strong></p>

<p>For everyone who isn't a frontend developer: Make sure you run your browser in a secure jail, disable JavaScript in your browser or use something like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> and boycott websites that has made their basic functionality dependent on JavaScript - you're seriously in risk of getting infected with malware just by visiting a website unless you take your precautions. And no, anti-virus software isn't going to help you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>MasterPlan is an idea board and project manager.&nbsp; It has the ability to create objects&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul><li>To-do lists</li><li>Timers</li><li>Images, GIFs, and Sounds</li><li>Deadlines</li><li>and Maps...</li></ul>
<p>... on a freeform grid, allowing you to <strong>plan&nbsp;projects out</strong>. You can use MasterPlan&nbsp;your way, whether as a moodboard for&nbsp;art, or as a productivity planner for your next big&nbsp;video game.</p>
<p>You can tweak how it looks to your liking, with themes and different visual&nbsp;options.&nbsp;The goal is to make it easy to plan out ideas, and to give you flexibility while doing so.</p>
<p>MasterPlan is currently in early access, and is receiving regular, steady updates that improve the functionality and usability of the program. These updates are <strong>lifetime</strong> updates and&nbsp;will remain free of charge for those who purchase MasterPlan. The cost of MasterPlan may rise as it becomes more and more feature-complete, naturally.</p>
<p>Note that the&nbsp;free demo of MasterPlan showcases its full functionality, but lacks the ability to save projects.</p>
<h4>How is it?</h4>
<p>Good!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER! MasterPlan is currently in its early access phase, and will receive&nbsp;updates regularly over time improving the stability of the program. I would recommend saving often and using it with a version control system to make it possible to roll back your plan in case of mistakes.</strong></p>
<p>Also note that only 64-bit builds are available currently; if there is a demand for 32-bit builds, please let me know and I'll see if I can get an easy way&nbsp;to build them.&nbsp;If you're feeling hacky or frugal, the complete source code for MasterPlan is available for perusal, building, and contribution on its GitHub repository&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SolarLune/masterplan" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br></p>
<h3>Steam?</h3>
<p>MasterPlan is now available on&nbsp;Steam, as well. If you purchase MasterPlan here,&nbsp;you will also be&nbsp;entitled to a free Steam key, accessible from the project download page.</p>
<p>____</p>
<p><strong>Recommended system requirements</strong></p>
<ul><li>Recent 64-bit&nbsp;versions of Windows (&gt;= 7), Mac&nbsp;(&gt;= 10.14), or Linux&nbsp;(&gt;= Ubuntu 18.04)</li><li>OpenGL 3.3-capable graphics card</li><li>A&nbsp;sound card</li><li>For clipboard support on&nbsp;Linux, a clipboard tool needs to be installed (any of xsel, xclip, or wl-clipboard). For file manager support on Linux, a file manager needs to be installed (any of&nbsp;zenity, qarma, or matedialog)</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A not so classic Chip8 emulator]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I always found emulators amazing pieces of software. The first I used was a SNES one, that I use to play some classic games I never was able to get when I was a kid. I thought those <em>beasts</em> were <em>black magic</em>, something I will never be able to grasp.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>I basically wanted to improve my OpenGL (and C++) skills through a fun project.
I always wanted to make an emulator, and the Chip8 is a fairly easy one to
start with. So why not making the rendering 3D to be able to move “inside”
the game.</p><p>Here is a small video of what it looks like:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3pDNioWFzI">youtube</a></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWF4xeW.gif" alt="video"></p><h2>About Chip8</h2><p>The Chip 8 is actually a virtual machine developed in the 70s by Joseph Weisbecker. So it was never a real console to begin with but we still can emulate it. There have been plenty of games written for it so we can run them later in our emulator.</p><p>This is probably the easiest emulator you can start with, since it has a very small number of opcodes and they are pretty simple to implement. You can find easily on the internet the specifications needed to be implemented. For instance on this <a href="http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM">website</a>.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_2_b4be3fe963.png" alt="chip8-2.png"></p><h2>C++ data modeling</h2><pre><code><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Cpu</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>{</span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    </span><span>uint16_t</span><span> opcode;
</span></span><span>    Memory &amp; memory;
</span><span><span>    </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>, 16&gt; registers;

</span></span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>So as we can see that machine is very simple. We've got 4Kb memory to work with, 16 registers and then some variables where we are storing the current opcode, the current index and the value of the program counter (pc).  There is two timers that are clocked at 60Hz. Each one of them should be decremented 60 times per second. If the <code>timerSound</code> is above 0, we should play a sound.</p><p>If you are interested in knowing more about it, you should check this <a href="https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/">guide</a> which explains a lot more things than me.</p><h2>Rendering</h2><p>Usually the games are rendered in a <code>64 * 32</code> framebuffer. To make mine a bit different from the others I decided to treat each pixels as a <em>cube</em>. Each single pixel is treated as an entity to be drawn, this is definitively not the most efficient way of doing it, but for such a small number of pixels it went well with an average of 200 fps on a machine without a dedicated graphic card.</p><p><img src="https://api.jeromem.dev/uploads/chip8_1_a9afb7f689.png" alt="chip8-1.png"></p><p>The 3D engine is a simple basic <strong>OpenGL</strong> renderer with a few shaders for the shadows and lights and a very basic <em>free fly camera</em>. The most important part is to render those array of pixels into cubes and translating it into 3D using matrices.</p><pre><code><span><span>auto</span><span> view = camera.getViewMatrix();
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> projection = glm::perspective(camera.getZoom(), </span><span>2.0f</span><span>, </span><span>0.1f</span><span>, </span><span>500.0f</span><span>);
</span></span><span><span></span><span>auto</span><span> cameraPosition = camera.getPosition();

            <p>The if-statement is a very basic thing, not just in bash, but in all of programming.
I see them used quite a lot in shell scripts,
even though in many cases they can be replaced with something much more elegant.</p>
<p>In this rather short article, I'll show how control operators can be used
instead.
Many probably know about this, but don't realize how to use them nicely.
This will help you write cleaner shell scripts in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple if-statements looks like in bash:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]
</span><span>then
    </span><span>command
</span><span>fi

</span><span># or
</span><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]; then </span><span>command</span><span>; fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ughh. Let's improve!</p>
<h2 id="control-operators">Control operators
    <a href="#control-operators" aria-label="Anchor link for: control-operators">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Bash provides <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Definitions.html#Definitions">control operators</a> to build sequences of
commands.
Some of these are conditional and allow logical branching based on the success
state of the last run command.</p>
<p>We will just focus on these two logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>: the AND operator, run the following command only if previous succeeded</li>
<li><code>||</code>: the OR operator, run the following command only if previous failed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exit-codes">Exit codes
    <a href="#exit-codes" aria-label="Anchor link for: exit-codes">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>You might wonder how bash considers whether a command succeeded.
This is where <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status">exit codes</a> come in.
When a program exits a numeric status code is returned.
A value of <code>0</code> means the program succeeded, any other value means it failed.</p>
<p>The exit code is normally hidden.
The status of the last run command is stored in the <code>?</code> variable.
You may inspect it by invoking:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>?
</span></code></pre>
<p>E.g., listing with <code>ls</code> normally returns <code>0</code>, but this value differs if the
directory doesn't exist or if an error occurred.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>ls ~</span><span>/            </span><span># exit code: 0
</span><span>ls </span><span>~</span><span>/nonexistent </span><span># exit code: 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will function similarly to almost any program.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-commands">Chaining commands
    <a href="#chaining-commands" aria-label="Anchor link for: chaining-commands">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Let's go over some examples to show how these control operators can be used.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Source_command">source</a> the <code>~/.profile</code> file, but only if it
is readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>]</span><span>; then
    </span><span>source </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span><span>fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using control operators:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>. </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only if the readability check expression is truthful/succeeds, we want to source
the file, so we use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>To require invoking user to be root, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command exists with <code>0</code>, so this propagates to <code>exit</code> if the
first expression is truthful.</p>

<p>If we'd like to print our profile file contents with a success message,
or an error message on reading failure, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cat ~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> This is your profile </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Failed to read profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can make these command sequences as long as you want. Useful for
building install scripts that go through a series of steps. You could define
bash functions for each step and orchestrate the installation like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>cleanup </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or format it differently to make long sequences better readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>cleanup </span><span>||
  </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre><h2 id="nice-to-know">Nice to know
    <a href="#nice-to-know" aria-label="Anchor link for: nice-to-know">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159514/61092">many</a> more control operators,
including list terminators, pipe operators, and others.</p>
<p>The <code>[</code> (commonly used in if-statements) isn't just a shell feature.
It is a binary on Unix-like systems, usually located at <code>/usr/bin/[</code>,
so it can be used anywhere.
It returns the exit code <code>0</code> if the expression was truthful.</p>
<p>You can chain multiple <code>[ expr ] &amp;&amp; [ expr ]</code> expressions together, they are
commands after all.</p>
<p>Bash also has <code>[[</code>, which is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13542832/1000145">different</a> from <code>[</code>.</p>
<p>You can wrap multiple commands with <code>{ expr }</code> to run it as single expression in
your command chain. For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>{ </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root</span><span>; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1 }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands do nothing more than returning <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Bash features <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">parameter expression</a>.
You can use <code>${EDITOR:=nvim}</code> to set the <code>EDITOR</code> variable to <code>nvim</code> only if
it is empty, so you won't even need conditionals.</p>
<p>Most other shells support similar operators. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> uses <code>; and</code> and <code>; or</code>, but now <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4620">supports</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> as well in modern versions.</p>
<p><code>$_</code> (or <code>Alt+.</code>) is your last used argument (noted by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lobste.rs/s/nao13f/elegant_bash_conditionals#c_brp038">@Diti</a>).
For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>test</span><span> -f </span><span>"</span><span>FILE</span><span>" </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>source </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span>" </span><span>|| </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span> does not exist</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span>2
</span></code></pre>
<p>A function or script returns the exit code of the last expression. If your last
expression is a command chain as described in this article, you might have an
unexpected exit code. See
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lw0ofg/elegant_bash_conditionals/gpf1lr0/">this</a>
comments.</p>

</h2>
<p>These command sequences with control operators are an elegant alternative for
simple if-statements. I think they look much better and are more expressive
looking at conditional logic.</p>
<p>But, don't overuse them. For bigger statements or advanced branching, you should
fall back to if-statements.</p>
<p>I hope this article motivates you to make your shell scripts a little more
elegant in the future by using these operators.</p>

Tom Muench, a city councillor in Richmond Hill, Ont., just north of Toronto, said newspapers are critical to&nbsp;the functioning of a healthy democracy, so it gives him pause that such a prominent newspaper chain may be financially beholden to an outside business to keep its doors open.</p>  <p>"I think it's fair to say that if a casino was to pop up in communities say six&nbsp;months ago, many local Torstar-owned papers&nbsp;would write a concerned local story," he told CBC News in an email.</p>  <p>He also wonders how those same newspapers would report on it, if any other sort of business were to open an online gambling operation on the side.</p>  <p>"If the federal government propped up the media with government tax dollars and now with casinos, how do we assure a strong independent news and media industry?"&nbsp;</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {

            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);

<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>

<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/fscanf">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was opening multiple shells for an unrelated project today and noticed how abysmal my shell load speed was. After the initial load it was relatively fast, but the actual shell start up was noticeably slow. I timed it with <code>time</code> and these were the results.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Original zsh profile" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/origzsh.png"></picture><p>You can time your own shell with:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq </span>1 10<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> /usr/bin/time <span>$SHELL</span> <span>-i</span> <span>-c</span> <span>exit</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Raw <code>bash</code>, as a comparison, was blazing fast - it averaged 0.03 seconds, with about 0.02 in user-land and 0.01 in kernel. This is with an empty <code>.bashrc</code> and other dotfiles, so it would prove to be a lower bound/goal.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw bash speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawbash.png"></picture><p>I was averaging 3.14 seconds, with 1.64 in user-land and 1.5 in kernel-land.</p><p>My zsh set up was nearly 100x slower than raw bash. I wanted to investigate what was going on, and why it was so much slower.</p><h3 id="intro">Intro</h3><p>Before we begin, it might be helpful to understand how shells in general start up. Shells are just an executable like any other on your machine - their purpose is to just take user input and behave like an old terminal. They have predefined control sequences, but in general are fairly extensible. The following is from ZSH man pages:</p><blockquote><p>Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden. … Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOT-DIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then /etc/zlogout are read.</p></blockquote><p>The following files are read:</p><div><div><pre><code>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
${TMPPREFIX}*   (default is /tmp/zsh*)
/etc/zshenv
/etc/zprofile
/etc/zshrc
/etc/zlogin
/etc/zlogout    (installation-specific - /etc is the default)
</code></pre></div></div><p>This gives a general flow of execution, and where zsh starts. My <code>.zshrc</code> leads to <code>source</code>ing a few other files, which just behaves as if the contents of those files was passed directly into the shell as standard input.</p><h3 id="profiling">Profiling</h3><p>We can start by profiling raw <code>zsh</code> - it’s even faster than raw bash.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Raw zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/rawzsh.png"></picture><p>The first step is to figure out exactly what’s taking so long - there are a variety of tools to measure performance, but the most useful will be <code>zsh</code>’s native debug tools.</p><p>This enables <code>xtrace</code>ing and <code>verbose</code> output. It’s not particularly great for time analysis, though - it does not include timestamps, so we have to eyeball the speed. It’s easy to catch a few immediate culprits - for instance, mine hung for at least a second on loading <code>nvm</code>. Anything that is a few orders of magnitude slower than the other commands will stick out like a sore thumb.</p><p>The second is an order-blind profiler - at the top of <code>.zshrc</code>, insert <code>zmodload zsh/zprof</code>. This will enable the built in profiling.</p><p>At the end of <code>.zshrc</code> insert <code>zprof</code>.</p><p>The output will look as follows:</p><div><div><pre><code>num  calls                time                       self            name

</code></pre></div></div><p>This will tell us exactly where <code>zsh</code> is spending most of it’s time.</p><h3 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h3><p>I started by playing around with high-level entry points. For instance, disabling <code>source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh</code> from my <code>~/.zshrc</code> cut my load time down by half, to roughly 1.7 seconds average. I then disabled <code>nvm</code> and my times plummeted. I had found the main two culprits of slow load times.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Zsh speeds with no Oh my zsh or nvm" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zshNoOmzNoNvm.png"></picture><p>My new average had become only 40 milliseconds. I didn’t want to lose the functionality that oh-my-zsh provided, however, so I looked into improving it.</p><p>I started profiling specific subsections of oh-my-zsh like so:</p><div><div><pre><code><span># I use gdate from brew's core-utils because macOS date does not support nanoseconds</span>
<span>timer</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span> 

<span># Original .zshrc/config file</span>

<span>now</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$(</span>gdate +%s%N<span>)</span><span>/</span><span>1000000</span><span>))</span>
<span>elapsed</span><span>=</span><span>$((</span><span>$now</span><span>-</span><span>$timer</span><span>))</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$elapsed</span><span>":"</span> <span>$plugin</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I wrapped all the plugin loading and sourcing, and profiled each one.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Profile functions" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/profiledfuncs.png"></picture><p>The plugin <code>command-not-found</code> was the main slow down of <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code>. I went through and disabled the plugins I didn’t use much and got my shell load time down.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Post changes to startup" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/postopt.png"></picture><p>My new shell start time was about half a second. <code>Oh-My-Zsh</code> still took up the majority of it, but I believe it to be a valuable addition. I do wish it put a bit more of an emphasis on performance, however.</p><p>The last thing to do is to lazy load functions and services that I don’t need. I found a <a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great sandbox lazyloader here</a> that was useful for nvm/rvm. Any command invocation of nvm from terminal, script, or otherwise still succeeds, it just gets lazy loaded the first time it’s invoked.</p><h3 id="observations">Observations</h3><p>Oh-My-Zsh is great and provides a lot of functionality, but it comes at a fairly heavy cost. As you can see above, it’s overhead accounts for nearly 70% of my load time.</p><p>There is one other thing of note - <code>oh-my-zshzsh</code> provides a built in function, <code>vcs_info</code>, to provide information about the the version control status of the current working directory. However, this is quite slow! For the actual Zsh git repo, it takes about <em>200ms</em> to parse. In large projects with a heavy git history this will hang your prompt return time for seconds. This won’t necessarily impact shell start time, but it will impact the amount of time it takes to actually display the prompt when navigating within a VCS-belonging directory. This can be slightly fixed with <code>git config oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1</code> on problematic repos, but it would be nice if it did so automatically. Setting the option <code>DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"</code> in your <code>.zshrc</code> can help as well, but comes with a loss of functionality.</p><p>Finally, a lot of time is spent in <code>compinit</code> and <code>compdef</code>. These are functions that create/define entries in the local completions cache (the <code>~/.zcompdump-machinename</code> file you might’ve noticed). There are a few hacks floating around GitHub, HackerNews, and various forums that try to remedy this (only check once a day, only check on new shell logins, etc), but none are particularly robust/without side effects.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In the future I hope to actually recompile zsh with additional profiling techniques and debug information - keeping an internal timer and having a flag output current time for each command in a tree fashion would make building heat maps really easy.</p><picture><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Final zsh speeds" src="https://blog.jonlu.ca/images/zsh_final.png"></picture><p>I ended with zsh taking about 0.42 seconds, or 420 milliseconds, to start up. Disabling Oh-My-Zsh gets the average down further to roughly 50ms. For now the extra 380 or so milliseconds are worth it, but I might be tempted to try another framework if I can’t get it any faster.</p><h3 id="final-note">Final Note</h3><p>While initial start time can (and should) be optimized, it pales in comparison to the importance of <em>prompt</em> return time.</p><p>In a typical workflow you’re returning to your prompt hundreds of times more than you’re actually starting new shell sessions. I’d like to profile prompt time much more, as I’ve noticed that even a 10% gain is noticeable (and much more important, as waiting any longer than half a second for a prompt will quickly become infuriating). As mentioned above, my largest culprit for prompt return time was <code>vcs_info</code> - I mostly work out of directories that have a git repo attached, and it’s very noticeable there.</p><h4 id="resources">Resources</h4><p>Here are a few resources I consulted while working on this post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284</a></li><li><a href="https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wpsuperheroes.com/slow-osx-terminal-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bennycwong.github.io/post/speeding-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5327</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/6056</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.peiyingchi.com/2017/08/17/speed-up-oh-my-zsh/</a></li><li><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://superuser.com/questions/236953/zsh-starts-incredibly-slowly</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.patshead.com/2011/04/improve-your-oh-my-zsh-startup-time-maybe.html</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/benvan/sandboxd</a></li></ul><p>Additionally, the specific dot files that I used above, in their original state, can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonluca/dotfiles/tree/551234df4d4527d6990ae3ea681bf015da8a0570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2019-07-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2019-09-19</span>.</p>
<p>Frontend developers are pushing JavaScript as though the web could not function without it. The fact is that JavaScript is one of the top reasons for security breaches on the client computer and client mobile phones, it is a plague that turns privacy into a public exhibition, and it has paralyzed the industry in such a way that you can hardly find a website that doesn't display "the white screen of death" if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it straight out: Frontend developers are breaking the Internet! They have been stricken with some kind of mass psychosis in which even the least amount of independent thinking has become so hard that you think you're dealing with a zombie. It doesn't even qualify as a form of blind following, because nobody is leading. It rather looks like everyone is running around frenzied.</p>
<p>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</p>
<p>I have worked as both backend and frontend developer since 1998 and I have never once made a web application depend upon JavaScript. This goes for web shops, blog systems, large CMS installations, as well as Intranet administration utilities, and much more. In situations where I have been hired as a consultant to an existing team, the first thing I have done was to remove any dependency on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Not once has a client ever experienced a problem with his web application as a result, rather on the contrary. Removing JavaScript makes the application load much faster, removes multiple security related attack vectors, and greatly improves customer privacy concerns and usability.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can simulate much of the improved UI experience that JavaScript can provide using only backend technology. The much improved performance, security, and privacy far exceed whatever loss of JavaScript capabilities you might experience.</p>
<p>The problem resides with websites that by nature doesn't require any form of JavaScript in order to serve the content they are serving. And the fact of the matter is that the majority of frontend developers aren't developing applications for niche markets with specific JavaScript requirements, rather they are developing regular websites, applications that in the end are just plain simple HTML. You do remember what plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is right?</p>
<p>Even most niche products that in nature perhaps do require some amount of JavaScript could often still be somewhat useful had they at least been build <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opt_in">opt-in</a> rather than not function at all.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever seen how a blind person uses the Internet? If not you need to have this demonstrated! Especially if you're a frontend developer. You might think that blind people who use the Internet are a minority, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter how many people with disabilities use the Internet, the Internet is for everybody, and when websites are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Currently most websites are developed without the least concern for accessibility which makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use and the way JavaScript is being used is a very big part of that problem.</p>
<p>Websites that create barriers for people with disabilities are generally just badly designed. Making websites accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. And you, as a frontend developer, must understand that it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your web application contains as few barriers as possible. If you don't do that, then why are you doing frontend development in the first place?</p>
<p>Web development is not about how to make the work fast and easy for the "lazy" frontend developer who long since has forgotten how to manually do anything and as a result no longer knows or understands how to put a simple website together without the use of a barrier producing framework or technology.</p>
<p>The optimal solution will always be to make sure that basic functionality works without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that more and more people disable JavaScript uncompromisingly, using extensions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a>, due to very valid security concerns. If a website isn't working without JavaScript it is loosing potential visitors and customers on a regular basis. If you only use a JavaScript based statistics system, such as Googles Analytics, then you won't even see the problem. You need to look into the statistics running on the backend such as the webserver logs to see how many visitors that visit your website without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>Security issues from third party JavaScript widgets and JavaScript libraries are vulnerable aspects of JavaScript that is actively exploited on a massive scale. Security issues in browsers, such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/#CVE-2019-11707">CVE-2019-11707</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-19/">CVE-2019-11708</a>, are highly critical issues that are completely mitigated if JavaScript is disabled or removed completely. CVE-2019-11707 is a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that can result in an exploitable crash due to issues in Array.pop which can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects. CVE-2019-11708 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">in arbitrary code execution</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the client is not a necessary evil. It is a tool that with great and meticulous care can improve the user experience to a certain degree in some unique situations, but if you are making your regular and non-unique web application depend upon JavaScript, then that is a clear sign that you are doing something very wrong.</p>
<p>Stop pushing JavaScript as a dependency just to make a regular and stupid website run!</p>

<p><time>March 1, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: People are unlikely to make swift changes to their core behaviors. By
detecting what they care about now, you will get an accurate estimation of
their near future behavior. That helps you answer the second question you need
to ask during an interview: «Can I work with you?»</p>

<p>The previous behaviors will likely continue to manifest themselves. That is one
of the natural qualities of us humans. Like Newtonian objects, we stay in
motion when we are in motion and lay at rest when we are already at rest. To
change that, we have to exert a massive force and consciously apply it. If we
do it for a long enough time, new behaviors set in and become habits. But
without that effort, we usually continue being who we are. Perfectionists will
continue chasing the ideal state and delaying project deliveries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cowboys</a>
will continue YOLOing untested solutions to production. In other words, the
matters people care about now are likely to govern their future behaviors.</p>

<p>That quality is both a challenge and a trait, depending on how you look at it.
If you want to change those behaviors in yourself, that is a challenge. If you
need to understand how a person would behave in a given context, that is a
valuable trait. And you can and should use this trait as a tool to learn more
about your candidates.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://autoiterative.com/blog/posts/what-to-ask-when-interviewing/">previous post</a>, we introduced a framework for hiring software
engineers.  It consists of three questions that you need to get sincere answers
to:
</p><ol>
<li>Can the candidate do the work?</li>
<li>Can I work with you?</li>
<li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to answer the first question is to let them do some actual work.
To answer the second one, assess their current behaviors and map them to your
company culture. This post explains in detail how to perform such an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-work-with-you">Can I work with you?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, all you need to do is compare a candidate behavior to
your company culture.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate what we mean with a concrete case. At AutoIterative, we have
already pulled all the hard work of defining what our culture is. For example,
one of our core values at AutoIterative is «to do science instead of
cargo-culting.» That means that we always want to understand why we do
what we do. Whether ideas are ours or not, we are comfortable questioning and
challenging them. So how do we determine where the candidate stands in that
regard? Could we ask straight whether they are confident with challenging their
ideas? Sure, but that will not give us a rigorous assessment. Chances are, the
answer would be: «yes, of course, I am!» We do not want to measure
wishful thinking or imagination. The better question would be to ask a
candidate about the last time they had their ideas challenged. From their
answers, we can derive a more reliable estimation of their behavior.</p>

<p>Let us show how a typical conversation could unroll (along with our notes
explaining why do we ask what we ask):</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Tell me about a recent
case when someone challenged an idea that you introduced?

<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Once, I pushed for the idea
of adding monitoring to our service. It was roughly a year ago, and I got a lot
of pushback from my team.

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer hints that the candidate cares about monitoring and metrics.
It is also helpful for analysis: it tells us how long ago that happened, it is
relevant, and it presents a situation. It is worth investigating in-depth, so
we decide to continue exploring it.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, what
happened? What was the pushback?
<span>(Note that we are using an open-ended
question here. We do not want our biases to influence their answers.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Well, we were having issues
in production at that moment. We were spending a lot of time reading logs,
trying to understand what was happening. Also, we were under pressure to
deliver a new feature. That could be the reason why people were not really
receptive to my idea when I proposed it. One of the engineers said that we have
no time for it now.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer sheds even more light on the situation. First, it reveals
that the team was under pressure (a data point on how the candidate might
perform in such circumstances). Second, it shows that the candidate wanted to
improve the situation by investing in observability (this is great for us!). It
also tells us there was a conflict (a data point on how the candidate might
defuse them). Now we should dig into those individual aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Why did you want to add
metrics?
<span>(asking <i>why</i> will force the candidate
to explain their reasoning. That defines the task they had to do at the
moment.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Because reading logs is not
the same as having metrics that you can query. Some visibility would have
improved the situation. I just wanted to understand the problem, fix it and
prevent us from getting into it in the future. We had to start somewhere, and
having those metrics would have provided a lot of value.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This candidate demonstrates that they care about the runtime (a valuable
trait for us!). They opt to invest a bit today for a better future (again,
aligned with our values). If they care about those things in our company, we
would be happy to work with them. Now, let us dig into the conflict bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, and how did
you handle the situation of your coworker saying a flat-out «no» to
your idea?
<span>(Note that here we exaggerate a bit what the
candidate said. Will they correct our impression? Will they confirm it and
elaborate more on how they saw the situation?)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I did not reply at the
exact time they said no. I did not want to provoke a conflict in front of
everyone during a standup meeting. It was not the first time I got a pushback
either. But we were all suffering, and I thought it was critical to add metrics
to our system to help us out of the situation. So after the meeting, I
approached my manager and explained the value we will get if we have metrics. I
asked for help pushing this forward.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: yes, this was an open conflict, and we need to drive the questions to
the resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: And what happened? How
did you present the idea to your manager?
<span>(Note the open-ended question again. It
pushes the candidate to explain <i>how</i> they behaved, allowing us to derive
the <i>why</i> behind that.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I explained that we were
drowning in operational work and that we were blind. I learned in the SRE book
that measuring requests and latencies is one of the first steps to do.  <span>(Note: this could be cargo-culting. Let us make a
note, so we can later dig into their reasoning.)</span> I thought it made sense
to try it. I told my manager that I was ready to take ownership of the whole
process. Initially, I just wanted to add a couple of metrics as a proof of
concept and see if that improved our situation.  If it did, we would spend less
time debugging and more time working on features. He liked the idea, and we
started working on a plan to communicate to our team that I would start working
on it.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: From their answers, we already have a clear definition of the action
that the candidate took. But there are more data points about the candidate.
They think about the team’s success (time spent working on a product instead of
debugging). They built a proof-of-concept to validate the idea before proposing
a full solution. They approached the manager asking for help instead of openly
arguing back. This behavior could hint at them being context-aware and a
team-player. They understood that the whole team is under stress caused by the
pressure to deliver.</p>

<p>The natural next step would be to push for closure and ask how the situation
ended. If you need more context, you can continue asking open-ended questions.
You will discover more details and get a more refined picture of a candidate’s
behavior. You can ask what the candidate learned from the situation and what
conclusions they drew from it. But let us wrap up the example here.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>

<p>As many of you probably realized, this is an interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA">SOARA</a>
techniques. The question explicitly asks for a story from the past, not for an
imaginary scenario. How a candidate replies to such an interview will yield a
lot of information and map to a behavior. Their answer will tell a story, and
their narrative will highlight what they value. From that, we would see what
their natural tendencies will be. And if you did your introspection and know
what your behaviors are, then comparing those two will answer whether you can
work together.</p>

<p>Note, however, that those techniques are not a silver bullet either. They will
not give you a 100% precise picture of a candidate out of a limited interview
time. No method will do that for you. But when applied correctly, they raise
your accuracy way above just the feelings. Focus on understanding and
thoroughly defining your culture. That will give you the exact dimensions along
which to measure your candidates. That, in turn, will provide a set of values
to assess. From them, you get an understanding of which questions are efficient
for you and which are not. Practice using the best ones, and you will answer
the second question with ease and precision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the AutoIterative platform will assess the candidate’s ability to do
the work.</p>

<h2 id="and-of-course-the-marketing-pitch">… and, of course, The Marketing Pitch™</h2>

<p>We solved the problem of software developer technical assessment. You no longer
need to resort to obscure rituals or torture them with the «Can you
reverse a linked list on a whiteboard?» (true story™) type of
questions. You no longer have to <i>*guess</i> whether the candidate can
deliver something that works. With the AutoIterative Production Challenges™,
you can instead just <i><em>test</em></i> that. And you can do it without investing a
single engineering hour before you know the answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <p>Was pulled in to a fun customer issue last Friday around disabling RC4 in Active Directory. What happened was, as you can imagine, not good: RC4 was disabled and half their environment promptly started having a Very Bad Day.</p> <p>— Steve Syfuhs (@SteveSyfuhs) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveSyfuhs/status/1366526316397301761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Twitter warning:&nbsp;</strong>Like all good things this is mostly correct, with a few details fuzzier than others for reasons: a) details are hard on twitter; b) details are fudged for greater clarity; c) maybe I'm just dumb.</p> </blockquote> <p>RC4 is a stream cipher. A stream cipher is kinda sorta like a one time pad (note: kinda, and sorta). A one-time pad is a cryptographic operation that takes one value and XORs it against a random value. A^B = C. A is your data, B is random noise. C is your encrypted cipher.</p> <p>They're incredibly useful because the XOR operation is only reversible when you know A or B, and if B is suitably random that means you have to guess for all combinations of B. In other words you have to brute force it. As far as cryptography goes that's nearly perfection.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg" alt="RC4 is broken" width="691" height="1203" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbcZfVVkAMDSrh.jpg"></p> <p>However, the trick with one-time pads is that you need as many random bits as you have data. If you have 10 data you need 10 random. If you 10k data you need 10k random. You cannot repeat the random, lest you introduce a pattern and code breakers just love patterns.</p> <p>So a stream cipher could take a one-time pad and cut the key down to a fixed length, manipulating the key every operation. Let's say you have 100 data and 10 random. The first 10 data get XOR'ed to the 10 random, then the 10 random get XOR'ed to something else. Repeat 10 times.</p> <p>This turns out to be incredibly simple to code and is incredibly fast relative to other crypto algorithms. However, the cost is that you're now doing key scheduling which means if you can predict the schedule you've broken the cipher.</p> <p>RC4 fits the bill here. It's painfully simple to implement. Here it is in entirety. But it's also irreparably broken.</p> <p>The thing with RC4 is that if you have enough data transformed by a single key you can eventually predict what the original plaintext is. This became a semi-practical attack in 2013 when some smart folks figured out how to apply this to TLS. <a href="https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/">https://isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/</a></p> <p>For this attack to happen it requires observing billions of bytes of data. This is done easily enough with TLS, hence why folks jumped at disabling RC4 cipher suites. TLS isn't the only place RC4 is used, and RC4 is still broken, so it's just good form to disable it everywhere.</p> <p>So now we have Active Directory and RC4 is enabled by default. In 2021?! How dare. Weeeeeelllll, RC4 isn't quite that bad in this case. Like, it's bad, but not super bad because each key will only ever be used for encrypting small amounts of data.</p> <p>The current attacks require observing *lots* of data encrypted with a single RC4 key. For Kerberos we're talking maybe 8-16kb at most, not the gigabytes required for the attack. So it's bad, but not end of the world bad.</p> <p>But that's no excuse. Why is it still there? Well, it turns out the RC4 cipher suite has a unique property: it doesn't require a salt when doing key agreement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Huh?</p> <p>So Kerberos has two legs between a client and KDC. AS and TGS.&nbsp;</p> <p>AS is how you authenticate yourself: here's password gimme krbtgt.&nbsp;</p> <p>TGS is: here's krbtgt gimme service ticket.</p> <p>Now we don't ever just send the password to the server. What we do is we encrypt a thing using the password as a key and fire that thing over to the server. The server also has your password and can decrypt. If it decrypts then we agree we both know the password.</p> <p>But Active Directory doesn't store the password itself. It stores a key derived from the password. That is, take the password and hash it, and store that hashed value. You encrypt against this hashed value.</p> <p>So lets go back in time, circa mid 90's when Active Directory was being built. Back then, in the real world, Windows authentication was NTLM. NTLM kinda sorta worked similarly where you derived a key from a password and used that key to sign some stuff.</p> <p>That derivation was and is admittedly very lame. It's `md4(password)`. So in NT Server in the directory database was username + md4(password), and that's it.</p> <p>And taking the cryptographic properties of NTLM out the picture for a moment, it still kinda sucked as an authentication protocol. It didn't offer server authentication and it wasn't easily extendable for future changes. So Active Directory switched to Kerberos.</p> <p>But we wanted upgrades to be seamless. When you left work Friday afternoon logging in to NT and came back Monday morning we wanted you to be able to log in to AD without any fuss, despite the fact that we changed literally everything out from under you.</p> <p>And Kerberos at the time was using DES (eww). This posed a problem. You can't transform an MD4 key into a DES key. The protocol certainly didn't let you do weird things like DES(MD4(password)), so Windows created the MD4+RC4 crypto system.</p> <p>The magic of this is that the NTLM key and Kerberos key are interchangeable so no password changes were required. Over time as users changed their passwords Active Directory would derive these newer, stronger, keys and would inform clients to prioritize these stronger keys.</p> <p>This turns out to be phenomenally powerful because it transparently migrates users to stronger keys without breaking anyone, at a small cost of delaying weeks or months as password changes occur. Is it perfect? No. Does it keep the masses happy? Yes.</p> <p>But there's another small problem: salts. Salts add randomness to passwords, making their hashed form incomparable to other hashes. hash('password', salt1) &lt;&gt; hash('password', salt2). We do this for all sorts of reasons, but the primary is so it's harder to guess the password.</p> <p>But salts complicate the protocol. Both client and KDC need to take the password and salt and derive the same key, so both need to know them. Seems simple enough? Just use a well known value...?</p> <p>Ah no, they need to be unique, otherwise two identical passwords with the same salt will form the same hash. Oops. Okay, compute a salt from the username. Aha, here we go, this works. It's unique and both parties know it. And it doesn't change! Oh wait, it can.</p> <p>Users change their usernames all the time because names change all the time. If the salt were just the username that means we'd have to recompute the hash in AD every time the username changed, which means we'd need to know the password and only admins change usernames so 🤔.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg" alt="AS-REP Ping response" width="457" height="387" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbpCjIVcAEjMED.jpg"></p> <p>Okay, so what if the KDC only changes the salt on password change and just tells us what it is whenever we authenticate? And so this is how Kerberos works. The client "pings" (no not ICMP) the KDC and the KDC says here ya go.</p> <p>And so long story short (hahahaha, oh.) we come to the customer issue. RC4 doesn't require a salt. AES requires a salt. You can see in the previous screenshot the ARCFOUR instance doesn't provide a salt because there just isn't one.</p> <p>If you use RC4 you don't need to ping the KDC. You can just derive the key from the password and go. Therefore if you disable RC4 conversely you must always know the salt.</p> <p>This poses a small challenge. Sometimes you don't want the system to know the password itself, so you provide these things called keytabs. They're files with some structured data that map users to derived keys. You derive the keys upfront once so you only need the password once.</p> <p>Sometimes these files are generated without having line of sight to a KDC too so the tool generating the file has to guess which salt to use. Sometimes the tool guesses the wrong salt. Oops.</p> <p>So you generate these files and deploy the thing and the system chugs along just fine until you disable RC4 and the whole things comes crashing down. The system was using RC4, and RC4 worked because there wasn't a salt. When it switched to AES it required the salt and...oops.</p> <p>Well that's a pretty lame experience for anyone, let me tell you. Why did the tool guess the wrong salt? I've already told you: because the name changed.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg" alt="UPNs can change" width="416" height="563" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvbtgCeVEAgLAHT.jpg"></p> <p>Active Directory lets you change your username. You actually have two different usernames. Your sAMAccountName and your UPN. You can use either to log in with Kerberos, but Active Directory will only derive your salt from a single value: the sAMAccountName + Realm.</p> <p>Well it happens that their UPN is in the form samaaccountname@customrealm.com, but their realm is anotherrealmentirely[.]com. As such their salt was ANOTHERREALMENTIRELY.COMsamaccountname. This happens when you add custom UPN suffixes.</p> <p>The password never changed so the salt never had a chance to change (not that it would). And the tool to generate the keytab just derived the salt from the user principal name, which in most cases is fine, but in this case wasn't.</p> <p>And so you might think to yourself that this isn't that big a deal you haven't ever changed the usernames or the suffixes or anything like that. It turns out there's exactly one scenario that every environment hits: when you promote the first DC in a forest.</p> <p>When you create a forest the domain admin is the machine's local administrator account. I'm not talking implicitly, I'm talking the local admin is copied into the AD database including it's password. The password that was set when you built the machine, before it had a realm.</p> <p>And the domain admin is part of the protected users group so RC4 is already disabled for them. That means they MUST use AES, which means they MUST use a salt, which means the salt had to exist when the machine was first built. Oy.&nbsp;</p> <p>So the realm is the computer name.</p> <p><img data-src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg" alt="The realm is the computer" width="945" height="414" src="https://syfuhsblog.blob.core.windows.net/images/2021%2F3%2FEvcBd4FVoAQ6NhK.jpg"></p> <p>Anyway. Here's some useful links as you consider getting rid of RC4.</p> <p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/tough-questions-answered-can-i-disable-rc4-etype-for-kerberos-on/ba-p/382718">Tough Questions Answered: Can I disable RC4 Etype for Kerberos on Windows 10 ?

<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>
This paper describes a possible Internet service that
some major organization such as
Harvard University, AT&amp;T,
the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers,
the American Mathematical Society, the American Medical Association,
or even the Vatican, might offer: a home page "in perpetuity".
Such a "perpetual page" or "eternity page" or
"e-memorial page" would be a home page that the organization would
help the customer set up, with a guarantee that it would
last for (say) 500 years, or until the organization no
longer exists.
It would list all the things that the customer would like to
be remembered for (accomplishments, family, etc.).
As the population of the U.S. ages,
such a service should prove very popular.
After all, almost everyone wants to be remembered by posterity.
</p><center><h2> Details </h2></center>
<ul>
<li>
The name for this service needs to be chosen with care, and
of course registered. "Eternity service",
"Perpetual page", "Eternity page", "E-memorial page",
"Everlasting page"
are a few possibilities. I will use "Perpetual page"
in this paper.

</li>
<li>
The first version of this paper was written in
December 1996, although the idea for the "Perpetual home page"
first occurred to me in January 1996.
Not surprisingly,
it turns out that other people have had similar ideas, and there may be some
commercial services that provide electronic gravestones available even now.
But my vision is that
this service would be offered by a major organization or institute,
that has already existed for a long time and
has some chance of existing 500 years from now.
And I'm not thinking of tombstones, but home-pages.

</li>
<li>
The "Perpetual page" could include such things as:
<ul>
<li>
photographs of houses, boats, paintings, other precious possessions
</li>
<li>
lists of awards, accomplishments
</li>
<li>
writings, drawings, songs, even unpublished novels
(disk space is cheap)
</li>
<li>
links to perpetual pages of one's family (including ancestors!) and friends
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's chance to write their own
<em>New York Times</em> obituary page, or "time capsule".
(Many people do not realize that except for a handful of major obituaries,
every obituary item in the <em>New York Times</em> has to be
purchased at about $40 per line -- this can be a humiliating
experience for the next-of-kin.
Setting up a "Perpetual page" in advance for the sick
and elderly could be both therapeutic and comforting for the family.)

</li>
<li>
There should be a generous amount of disk
space available for each page - a minimum of ten megabytes,
to allow a number of photographs to be included. (Most Internet
providers at present do not allow nearly enough disk space.)
As my colleague 
Andrew Odlyzko has pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~amo/doc/tragic.loss.txt">
discussion of the future of scholarly journals</a>,
the cost of disk space is dropping so rapidly that it is likely that 
the cost of providing a service
in perpetuity will be not much more than that of providing it for
one year.

</li>
<li>
The organization would help the customer set up the initial page, and would
provide instructions on how to maintain it.
A "help desk" would be part of the service.

</li>
<li>
One way to structure the offer might be to tell customers:
For a one-time fee of $X, we will provide you with Y MB of
storage, and as long as you pay a small monthly fee,
you can keep modifying it.  Once you stop paying the monthly fee
(say because you die, or switch to a different
provider) we will keep the latest version <em>forever</em>.

</li>
<li>
Part of the offer would be a guarantee that when the Internet is replaced
by some other service in a few years, all the "Perpetual pages"
would be automatically converted to the new medium.

</li>
<li>
It is important that the organization offering the servce
should have been in existence for a long time, and have a good chance of
still existing 500 hundred years from now.
The organizations mentioned in the Abstract certainly
satisfy these conditions, and it is easy to think of others. 
Such a service would not carry much conviction
if offered by some tiny local Internet service provider.

</li>
<li>
This is the first time in history that such a thing is possible.

</li>
<li>
Incidentally,
the <em>New York Times</em>} for Saturday Dec. 7 1996 describes (on page D2)
a patent, US 5,517,791, for a new tombstone design that can
incorporate a person's life story - including photographs.
So ideas like the one I am proposing are "in the air".

</li>
<li>
As one may verify by visiting cemeteries in New Jersey, tombstones are rarely
legible after a hundred years have passed.  One of the advertisements for the
proposed service could show a family searching through a
cemetery full of grave stones that have been worn smooth,
looking for the lost grave of an ancestor.  Furthermore,
as the world population continues to explode,
cemeteries will become increasingly irrelevant.

</li>
<li>
The "perpetual page" service would especially appeal to mature customers.
There are several ways in which advertisements could point out the futility
of earlier attempts to be remembered, even by world leaders.
For example, one advertisement could show a replica of the original
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
after which all later mausoleums are named.
(See <em>The Oxford History of the Classical World</em>,
ed. J. Boardman et al., Oxford, 1993, p. 150.)
<center> <img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/maus1.jpg"> </center>
<p>
One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was
built in the year 353 for King Mausolus of Caria by his wife.
It no longer exists.
"But if King Mausolus had had a perpetual page, we could still read
about his victories today ...".

</p></li>
<li>
An alternative way in which the "perpetual page" could be used is
by family and friends after the death of a loved one, by setting up a
permanent memorial for the deceased.  The Page would need to have an
authorized keeper, to screen out inappropriate material.
A certain amount of permanent space would be purchased, to which
interested parties could contribute in any way they wished.


</li>
<li>
Another advertisement could have a voice reading P. B. Shelley's
poem <strong>Ozymandias</strong>,
while the picture shows dust blowing around an appropriate ruin:

<pre>     I met a traveller from an antique land 
     Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
     Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
     Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
     Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
     The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
     And on the pedestal these words appear: 
     `My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' 
     Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
     Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
     The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</pre>
<center><img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/ozy4.jpg"> </center>
</li>
<li>
It will also give all the unpublished poets and writers,
the unrecognized painters and musicians, the scientists
whose theories are rejected, the opportunity to have their
work immortalized.

</li>
<li>
Yet another advertisement could have Jessye Norman singing the moving
and unforgettable aria "Remember Me"
from Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas".
(The formal title
is "Thy hand Belinda - when I am laid in Earth"
[Philips CD 434 161-2].)

</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“What is the point of using a tool that will facilitate you to do something you don’t even know what it is? That’s not facilitation. That’s ignorance support and MUST be avoided”. Mário Júnior</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is a very interesting and powerful platform but exploring its powers requires knowledge of their existence and a bit of its internals comprehension. The most essential terms when we talk about web are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a>. Some people would argue that I should add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON</a> to the list, but lets just say JSON is included in JavaScript. If you know these terms and you are familiar with them, then you got a word to say about web development.</p>
<p>The terms I just listed define the web and most of them are not just terms, are languages with their very own purpose, syntax, and limitations: HTML, CSS, JS.</p>
<p>Imagine having to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript without the proper tools to assist you for example: debugging JavaScript code, Inspecting CSS properties and DOM Elements. This was the stack of challenges that web developers had to face long back ago if they decided to embrace that trio. To get around this, technology companies came up with Frameworks literally <em>giving developers the possibility of building web application without having to master HTML and CSS and without even writing a single line of JavaScript.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK,</a> <a href="http://www.javaserverfaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSF</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ASP</a>, all them still sell with that same propaganda, but now we have the tooling we needed to use that trio.</p>
<p>Now we got web browsers with super-powers and <em>we don’t just want to be presenting forms to users</em>. These new features the browsers are supporting, are supposed to be used to enhance business processes, to make an effective change in users lives and this is why I brought this conversation to the table, because most of us seem to be stuck in that tooling-less time.</p>
<p>People no longer make jokes about JavaScript, they follow it, they love it so much that they even made some effort to have it running in other environments different from web browsers (take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NODE.JS</a> project as an example). Microsoft even invested creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> and yet you hate and fear JavaScript?</p>
<p>Some people would argue that in enterprise, “how it looks” is not the most important, because the most important is that “it works”. For these people, I would say: “How it looks” defines the time the user will take to accomplish his goals, “How it looks” may not matter when you are offering a solution to someone that has no choice, because if that person has a choice, trust me, I would stick to the solution that works and looks better. <strong>People don’t want to open their browsers on their retina display powered screens to see some “basic” web app that “just works”.</strong> Wake up fellers, it’s not the “just make it work” era anymore. Presentation can make people happier and happy people are guaranteed to deliver better results, now tell me that’s not an “enterprise” matter!</p>
<p>We can also shift the view, from the end-user perspective to the software design perspective. Frankly speaking, web servers are only useful nowadays because they allow us to deliver dynamic content. But the client-side (Browsers) only understands HTML, CSS and JS. The framework you use, being it <strong>ZK, JSF, ASP</strong> or whatever HTML generator engine you use that sells you the “no javaScript” propaganda, will actually generate HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then send it straight to the browser. What if you write HTML, CSS and JS by yourself? What if you separate the client from the server, as the best practices suggest (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separation of concerns</a>)? Wouldn’t you get a clear vision of what each of the layers should do? Instead of gluing them and building some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monolithic</a> and server-dependent web app? Wait! Did I just say “server-dependent”? Yes I did say that and what I was trying to say is that, you shouldn’t need a server to test the UI (only the UI) of a web app. If you detach your UI from your Back-End and use pure web technologies (CSS, HTML and JS), you get the chance to explore the maximum of each of the parts and that’s what you are supposed to do. You are supposed to give the best you can and right now, <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PrimeFaces</a>, <a href="https://www.zkoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZK</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telerik</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICEfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IceFaces</a>, etc, are the best you can. These tools are limiting your power, thus, limiting the power of your enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>I have nothing against these ideas, companies, or their owners</strong>, and I don’t want them to be extinct, I want them to evolve their business too. I want them to stop selling frameworks that will uniformize UI and <strong>start selling services</strong>. I want them to sit and build a UI for a specific problem, with the attention that specific problem deserves, using the pure web.</p>
<p>I had this idea for too long in my mind and I lived with the fear of unleashing it, but then I realised I’m not the only one with this thoughts. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Fowler</a>, I have been reading some of his articles, watching some tech-talks of his and he is a professional I admire and I look at as an inspiration. When I figured out that the company he works for, is kinda advising people to do exactly what I have been thinking about, I told myself: “It’s time to unleash this thoughts and raise a debate if necessary”. Martin fowler works for <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoughtWorks</a>, a software respected company that have developed solutions for companies all over the world and here is what they said about JSF and ASP Forms:</p>
<p>“We continue to see teams run into trouble using JSF – JavaServer Faces – and are recommending you avoid this technology. Teams seem to choose JSF because it is a Java EE standard without really evaluating whether the programming model suits them. We think JSF is flawed because its programming model encourages use of its own abstractions rather than fully embracing the underlying web model. JSF, like ASP.NET webforms, attempts to create stateful component trees on top HTML markup and the stateless HTTP protocol. The improvements in JSF 2.0 and 2.2, such as the introduction of stateless views and the promotion of GET, are steps in the right direction, maybe even an acknowledgement that the original model was flawed, but we feel this is a too little too late. Rather than dealing with the complexity of JSF we recommend teams use simple frameworks and work closely with web technologies including HTTP, HTML and CSS.” ThoughtWorks Radar</p>
<p>I think the essential was caught. <strong>Let’s embrace the real web and lets also innovate in presentation in order to enhance and improve the life of our customers and partners</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to end this article with a question for the local enterprises (Maputo/Mozambique): <em>Why aren’t you hiring Front-End/UI/UX engineers? Would it be because you are going monolithic or because presentation doesn’t matter?</em></p>
<p>I want you to leave a contribution on this article. Say something on the comment box down there.</p>
<p>It’s always a pleasure for me to share my thoughts with all of you guyz.</p>

              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>

<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

		<p>Yet another PDP-1 riddle, extended mode.</p>

		<p><span>Y</span>esterday, we solved the mystery of <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2021/train-spotting-1">two well-known images</a>, formerly known as “The PDP-1 at the Tech Model Railroad Club”, with the help of the Hacker News community. — A triumph of shared knowledge.</p>
		<p>In 1971, the German artist Daniel Chodowiecki (1726 – 1801) commented his etching “Enlightenment” <em lang="de">(Aufklärung)</em> by the words, “However, if the sun only rises, mists do no harm.” <em lang="de">(Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.)</em> In real life, mists rise only to reveal another bank of fog. Which is the very process of research. — And this is certainly no exception. So this is a post about annother bank of fog, in the amazing form factor of a fully transitorized electronic contraption apt to manipulate 18-bit words in realtime according to a stored program and human interaction.</p>

Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.”</p>

		<h2>Another PDP-1B Prototype?</h2>
		<p><span>Y</span>esterday’s sunrise, <em>um,</em> success was the indentification of the scene of a series of images showing a somewhat rudimentary front part of a DEC PDP-1 and a Type 30 Visual CRT display next to a model railway layout. And we proceeded to conclude that this was a PDP-1 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, operated by the Program Head of the CS program, J.A.N. Lee (probably around 1970).</p>

		</figure>

		<p>However, this also posed a new riddle, as at least two sources referred to this machine as a PDP-1B. Namely, the history page of the UMass Amherst CS program’ website,</p>
		<blockquote>
		The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Following established knowledge, there was a single PDP-1A prototype, followed by two PDP-1B pre-production prototypes (one going to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, the other to BBN) and the production models PDP-1C and PDP-1D, the latter being the enhanced time-sharing model. Further, the two pre-production prototypes had a 4-cabinets main unit, which was repackaged for a more cost effective and reliable 3-cabinets design for the production models. This history leaves no apparent room for a PDP-1B at Amherst. So is this an error in these attributions, maybe referring to a common source as a single point of failure, or is there more to this?</p>

		<h2>PDP-1 Lineage</h2>
		<h3>All-White PDP-1s</h3>
		<p>The first prototype, PDP-1A, was an all white machine, featuring an integrated control desk with built-in CRT and operator’s console, a three-cabinet packaging of the main unit, and a Friden Flexowriter as a console typewriter. This machine was presented at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.</p>

		<p>The same machine (and the same image) also appeared in the initial announcement in Datamation, November/December issue 1959:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Then, there is a white 4-cabinets machine seen in early DEC materials, here from a brochure from March 1961. This all-white machine features a 4-cabinets main unit, a detached control console with black print and the early DEC logo (more on this later), a CRT display in similar hexagonal housing as later Type 30 CRTs, but mounted on a narrower, single-unit stand, and a Soroban console typewriter (a modified IBM Model A):</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Apparently, we see this machine again at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in an image in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> by David Walden and Raymond Nickerson (ed.), 2010; page 51:</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The following, rather blurry image from <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/08/102740407-05-01-acc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Digital Equipment Corporation – Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present”</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, MA, 1972; p.3) seems to show the same machine (all white, 4 cabinets, detached console), but with a different CRT with the standard double-unit display stand. Notably, the paper-tape devices on the left and the chairs look much like the one the BBN image, hinting at the photo showing the same installation.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The same configuration appears in yet another photo (from the “DIGITAL Computing Timeline”), here, explicitely tagged as <em>“The PDP-1 operating system, the world's first timesharing system, is written by engineers at MIT and BBN for the PDP-1. (…) Shown here is the PDP-1 installation at BBN.”:</em></p>

		</figure>

		<p>At this point it may be fair to assume that the images of the white PDP-1B, found in early DEC brochures, are actually depicting the BBN PDP-1B.</p>

		<p>The last image (to my humble knowledge) in this lineage of all-white PDP-1s featuring a detached console seems to be an early production PDP-1 in 3-cabinets packaging at Itek (allegedly the second production machine):</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Something, all these all-white machines with a detached console have in common, is that they are lacking an integrated paper-tape unit. In these images, we see a separate generic paper-tape unit associated to the machine, usually to the left of the control console. DEC even envisioned the tape unit as a detached desk appliance, much like the control console:</p>

		<p>Here’s a short history of this strand of PDP-1s, as comprehensively told in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> (ibidem, pp. 53–55):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Eastern Joint Computer Conference was in Boston in December 1959, and there Fredkin saw the PDP-1 and “realized it was fantastic.”
		The project to design and build the PDP-1 had started just four months prior to that. Ben Gurley was the designer, and he also built the computer with the help of one engineering assistant.</p>
		<p>“So,” says Fredkin, “I convinced BBN to become Digital’s first customer for the PDP-1. We arranged to borrow the prototype PDP-1 while Digital built the first ‘production’ version.” The prototype machine (a PDP model 1a) was delivered to BBN in early 1960.
		At the time, according to Fredkin, Digital had the idea that a computer manufacturer shouldn’t do software. Thus, Fredkin wrote the assembler for the machine, wrote utility routines (like a rudimentary operating system), and so forth. In that era programs were typically written on ruled sheets with columns for the various fixed-length instruction fields. Ed’s assembler for the PDP-1 was called FRAP, which stood for “free of rules assembly program” and which allowed variable-length instructions. At some point Fredkin also wrote light pen software for the machine.</p>
		<p>Eventually the first production model PDP-1, a PDP model 1b system (serial number 2), arrived at BBN. That was Digital’s first PDP-1 sale. Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>When the PDP-1b arrived, BBN had a ceremony with a lot of hoopla. I wrote a little program so that the PDP-1b could cut its own ribbon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony (appropriate since one of the ideas was for the PDP-1 to interact with the real world). Digital founder Ken Olsen was present.</p>
		<p>Bill Fletcher also was working with Fredkin on the PDP-1b. (…)</p>
		<p><strong>PDP-1b Time-Sharing: the Research Computer System</strong></p>
		<p>Fredkin says that he had the idea of hiring John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. This soon led to plans to develop a time-sharing system for the PDP-1. McCarthy had the idea of time-sharing, and Fredkin saw the potential for time-sharing on the PDP-1. (…) Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>John’s invention of time-sharing and his telling me about his ideas all occurred before the PDP-1 existed. When I first saw the PDP-1 at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, I realized that it was the perfect low-cost vehicle for implementing John’s ideas. That is why I specified that several of the modifications for time sharing be part of the PDP-1b.</p>
		<p>Fredkin knew Ben Gurley <em>[designer of the PDP-1; N.L.]</em> (from Lincoln Laboratory), who was the machine designer at Digital; thus, Fredkin also suggested or designed improvements for the hardware with time-sharing in mind. For instance, Fredkin designed the input/output system to be the first to have a modern …</p></blockquote></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are usually involved in projects demanding a high level of software quality, whether they be large legacy applications, where the customer is already beset with problems and is trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, or newer pilot projects, which need to be built on stable foundations. As experienced technical experts we can of course help to get things on the right track. Having said that, we frequently find that our customers initially do not understand how quality is about a lot more than just good technology.</p><p>Even technically excellent teams can slip into quality problems if the working conditions or the project goal are unclear. In this article we explain why this is the case and what we can do about it.</p><h2>Is it a bug or a feature?</h2><p>Poor software quality often only comes to management’s attention when the number of errors reaches an unacceptable level. Yet what is actually a bug and what is just a (missing) feature? This question often leads to discussions between the product and development teams and cannot, strictly speaking, be answered without a clear written specification of the software’s requirements.</p><p>How do we decide during development what can be removed and what needs to remain? Most developers have experienced the situation where a bug fix leads to a string of new ones, due to something “not working like it used to” in the new version. For fear of breaking something, we often see developers steer clear of improving bad software design, which in turn leads to a continuing deterioration of the software’s maintainability.</p><p>To escape from this dilemma we need a shared understanding of what the software actually is: that is to say, what can it do and what not? Each user story should include clear acceptance criteria and, where applicable, define what is out of scope. For effective software development the team also needs to understand the broader context, i.e. not just <em>what</em> it is developing, but also <em>why</em> it is required and what concrete use cases are envisaged. Experienced teams avoid bugs through this type of communication, before they even begin with the implementation in code.</p><p>The development team still of course needs the right technical skills and experience in order to ensure that the software functions properly and is adequately protected through automated tests. Best practices such as pair programming, code reviews and test driven development (TDD) can help achieve this.</p><h2>Tests</h2><p>We frequently encounter projects with inadequate test coverage. Our approach is not to write new code or fix a bug without corresponding automated tests to verify the expected behaviour. This, however, presupposes that it is clear what the software is supposed to do.</p><p>Acceptance criteria in a user story serve as a basis for understanding this. Acceptance test driven development (ATDD) even goes so far as to translate the written specification into executable tests. Similarly, in the case of bugs, the way in which the functionality deviates from expected behaviour and how the error can be reproduced need to be clearly defined. This information can then be mapped into appropriate automated test cases so as to ensure functional correctness and avoid regression.</p><p>It is critical for the business to understand high test automation as an integral part of high-quality software <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/2020/09/wie-qualitaet-uns-schneller-macht/">which actually makes development faster</a>: development speed should always be measured based on <em>working</em> features. Unfortunately, the deployment of technical experts is in many cases not enough to communicate this message, rather, the business often requires significant cultural and organisational upheaval, which reaches as far as management level, to achieve this. Development teams cannot bring about such a change on their own.</p><p>Additionally, efficient test automation can only be achieved when developers and testers work together cross-functionally. If testing is only carried out after the development stage (for example by a dedicated QA department) many of the advantages of test automation, such as fast feedback loops, are lost. Consequently organisational aspects such as team structure and process often go hand in hand with technical matters.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough just to deliver good requirement documents and to expect a new culture to appear. Teams need to be capable of mapping these requirements onto an efficient test pyramid and ensuring the software still works in ensuing months and years. Even good teamwork is a skill that cross-functional teams need to learn through practice.</p><p>Furthermore, code testability is very much dependent on good software design. Technical methods, for example test driven development and refactorings, can help to improve this, and such methods can be more readily established when experienced developers or coaches are on hand.</p><h2>Refactorings</h2><p>Legacy applications often suffer from old code being difficult to understand and maintain. This leads to new features being very expensive and to an ever-increasing bug rate.</p><p>Experienced teams refactor their application code continuously and ideally avoid these pitfalls. They are capable of recognising how the software design can be improved as they go along in order to implement the current feature and regularly switch between the “two hats” (new functionality and refactoring) to achieve the goal in hand. They also keep an eye on upcoming requirements to ensure the technical foundations are optimised to deal with them. In order to achieve this they keep open a continuous dialogue with product team representatives and understand the current business goals.</p><p>But what happens when larger refactorings are required? Teams with only a technical focus might prefer to leave no stone unturned in order to achieve their interpretation of technical perfection and might even push for a complete rewrite of the application. This is, however, rarely the most efficient use of limited resources.</p><p>Refactorings should always be geared towards making the job in hand and future requirements easier and quicker to implement. Yet in order to achieve this, it is important to understand where the application is heading. A clear product vision and strategic focus on defined goals is critical so that refactorings with the most value (i.e. which improve future development speed) can be prioritised.</p><p>Whether larger refactorings should be undertaken is always a judgement call, which cannot be made solely based on technical reasons. A clear product strategy, which defines the key parameters for anticipated functional requirements, is incredibly helpful to estimate the relative effort of the refactorings and to answer important questions such as:</p><ul><li>How and to what extent will this component be extended in the coming development cycles?</li><li>Does the current software design satisfy the requirements on the product roadmap?</li><li>Do we (in the worst-case scenario) need to throw this component away and start from scratch?</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, even the best product vision cannot be fulfilled if teams do not have the technical skills to dig themselves out of the hole they find themselves in. Once it is clear where the journey is heading, developers still need the right technical skills and training to understand how to refactor a legacy application and keep the project on the right track.</p><h2>Architecture</h2><p>Software architecture is not an end in itself, but should seek to provide an optimal technical foundation for the product’s business requirements. There is no such thing as “the best architecture”, rather, it is always a question of making trade-offs. A software product will always have multiple architecture goals which conflict with and need to be weighed up against each other. Again, the product’s goal and its functional requirements will also play an important role here in making the appropriate architectural decisions.</p><p>During development, even the best teams will keep coming up against conflicts between current and future requirements. On the one hand, software architecture should be evolutionary and be improved incrementally, as it is impossible to predict users’ feedback and the exact nature of future priorities. Yet, on the other hand, certain architectural decisions do need to be made early enough in the development process so that the right foundation is in place to facilitate productive development. Only a well-functioning team, which not only brings together the relevant technical and business knowledge but also assumes responsibility for the software’s architecture, will be in a position to make the right decisions and react to changes in requirements in the best possible way.</p><p>Only through such teamwork is it possible to identify the right context boundaries in the application and to define the business domains and their objects. It is also critical to establish a universal language for these domains, so that business objects and the software’s use cases are clearly understood by the entire team.</p><p>Successful teams discuss the software’s architecture as part of their daily business and are able to experiment with various possible solutions. This is not possible in organisations where small predefined tasks are imposed on development teams from above or where teams are constantly under pressure from external deadlines. Agile practices in self-organised teams are therefore an important precondition for good architecture decisions.</p><p>It is, on the other hand, not enough simply to introduce agile frameworks and hope that this leads to teams being immediately capable of good software architecture. This will usually not be the case without support and coaching from experienced developers, especially if the previous working conditions were very different and the developers do not have prior experience of working in self-organised teams.</p><h2>Code quality and the “four eyes principle”</h2><p>Methods such as clean code, pair programming and code reviews help to achieve a high level of software quality. As technical coaches we can help out in these areas, but this …</p></div></div>

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know should know by now the perpetual licensing pattern: you buy a license to certain software, you receive updates for a year or two, depending on the license, then you stop receiving updates for the app and you can use that version forever.</p>



<p>The main problem with this type of license, from a user’s perspective, is consistency. <a href="https://pacurar.dev/uses/">I use</a> quite a few software with this type of license BUT the main difference is that some are updated daily/weekly or at least monthly and some are less frequently updated.</p>



<p>Most applications receive tons of updates after the initial release and then they magically stop receiving updates or new features for a while. My question is: why buy another year of your software if in the past 5-6 months I received only a minor update? What will I miss if you do not update it? Well, for most applications, you won’t miss anything… except some euros in your pocket.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there’s software like TablePlus that is fully worth paying for it year by year because it is updated a lot and you would miss a lot of features if you are stuck on an old version.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I have a problem with all subscriptions lately. You pay a subscription for everything, and now you are required to pay monthly for software too. It all piles up, and sure, developers make more money and they can afford 5$ here and 5$ there, but again, it all piles up and at the end of the month you end up giving a lot of money on licenses.</p>



<p>So… maybe a perpetual license is ok though and it all depends on the developer itself if clients would renew their license: keeping an updated app and adding new features would make a higher percentage of the clients renew their license for another year.</p>



<p>What do you say, what is the best license for you and your needs? How many perpetual licenses do you pay yearly?</p>

First, you have to be able to recognize what good looks like in that domain. Second, you must have realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result – the scope,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="2783">Recognition and scope, according to Bezos, are the two most important rules to deliver high standards. And in an example that applies directly to writers, he says, “We don’t do PowerPoint presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos.” And the quality of these memos, Bezos admits, varies widely.</p><p id="fa97">Here’s the difference between a great memo and an average one.</p><p id="c6c4">Average writers fail to recognize what differentiates their work from that of the top writers in their field. And this failure of recognition never propels them in the right direction. They can’t do better because they don’t understand what better looks like.</p><p id="5d9e">Although, at Amazon, “often when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more,” writes Bezos.</p><p id="75f4">To prove his point, Bezos uses an interesting <strong>headstand analogy</strong>. He says if you try to perfect a headstand in just two weeks when in reality it takes about six months of daily practice, you’re just going to end up quitting. In other words, it’s not about hard work, it’s about having realistic beliefs on scope.</p><p id="0489">According to Bezos, great memos are:</p><ul><li id="4ea6">written and re-written,</li><li id="468d">shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work,</li><li id="4bf5">set aside for a couple of days,</li><li id="4fee">and then edited again with a fresh mind.</li></ul><p id="11cb">Again, all of these things, re-writing, editing, giving your work the room to grow, and asking for suggestions and improvements, are all really the best pieces of writing advice out there. But, “the key point”, Bezos insists, “is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo (or any piece of writing) probably should take a week or more.”</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>While coding professionally I’ve used Gradle, Maven, and Ant. I think Gradle is my least favorite.</p>
<p>There have been a couple good critiques of Gradle that I’ve read lately. I want to note them here for completeness, but then move on to outline my own frustrations which come from a different angle.</p>
<p>First there is <a href="https://www.bruceeckel.com/2021/01/02/the-problem-with-gradle/">this</a> article by Bruce Eckel. The central argument really spoke to me and got me thinking about this topic. In the post Bruce states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do anything [in Gradle] you have to know everything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been my experience and frustration as well, and is not typically a sign you are using a good tool.</p>
<p>In the second <a href="https://phauer.com/2018/moving-back-from-gradle-to-maven/">article</a>, Philipp Hauer writes about (amongst other things) the unnessisary churn Gradle causes by regularly <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_5.html#dependencies_should_no_longer_be_declared_using_the_compile_and_runtime_configurations">breaking compatibility</a>, in addition to the confusing and opaque rules of the DSL.</p>
<p>Again, 100% agree here. I will also note Gradle constantly <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiweb/dependencies.gradle#L4">offering</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/performance-comparisons/blob/e174b35fcd9aef362f8062fe08443870ce2061da/exclude-merging/apiServiceLayer/dependencies.gradle#L6">multiple</a> <a href="https://github.com/gradle/build-analysis-demo/blob/4aaac6d82f2dc4bd1e9a7825d420c1b32856f789/build-producerator/build.gradle.kts#L8">ways</a> to do the same thing does not help here :~).</p>
<p>These are both great articles. They’ve made a case I find compelling, and are worth a read, but I’m not going to dive any deeper into those topics. I just want to make them visible, and will now move on.</p>
<p>I want to focus on Gradle from the perspective of a large organization, and how it is a terrible build tool for maintaining numerous projects.</p>

<p>The company I work for uses Gradle heavily now for our builds. We have been migrating to a microservice world for a while now, so have an ecosystem of, I wanna say, a couple hundred services and libraries. All of these services and libraries have at least one - but usually two - Gradle builds, so the total number is roughly 2x that.</p>
<p>We also have one git repository per service, no monorepo, so naturally have some jobs that do care-taking. Bump dependencies, enforce formatting rules, perform small migrations, etc. Gradle is horrible for this type of automation.</p>

<p>So how do we update our <code>build.gradle</code> with new dependencies?</p>
<p>Ultimately we need to be able to understand groovy. We don’t want to write a full-blown interpreter, so we support a subset of what we need to understand in the Gradle DSL. In our case we enforce a convention where each project declares its dependencies in a <code>dependencies.gradle</code> file that is simple enough for dumb parsers to understand and modify.</p>
<p>With this convention we have come full circle! We didn’t like declarative builds because they weren’t flexible enough, so we moved to Gradle, which is really just Groovy. But now we can’t understand what Gradle builds are doing, because the underlying language is too complex for dumb parsers. So we introduce an ad-hoc declarative style.</p>
<p>In the end Gradle enforces very little. There is some convention, but you can really do what ever you want, so gods know what is happening in those hundreds of Gradle files.</p>

<p>There’s another thing we’ve been working on lately. Gradle now has a <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html">Kotlin</a> variation of it’s DSL<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Our company is heavily using Kotlin now, so a developer has been working on a script to migrate the hundreds of projects to the <code>build.gradle.kts</code> format. I agree with this migration. We all use Kotlin, so switching the format will give us more comfort and ease in maintaining those builds. It’s how this migration is happening that made my jaw drop.</p>
<p>In the end everything is just Groovy, and there is no great Groovy to Kotlin converter available, so the present migration strategy is basically: run a bunch of regexes against the <code>build.gradle</code> to optimistically search and replace Groovy with Kotlin syntax. <strong>A human</strong> then needs to come in and fix the final n% of things that didn’t convert properly. On hundreds of projects.</p>
<p>This is insane. For any organization that is trying to build an automated system for updating and migrating hundreds (if not thousands) of projects, it is insane that our best option is use <code>grep</code> and cross our fingers. This is not the first migration we have done, and will not be our last, and the number of projects is only going to increase.</p>

<p>We are a professional community that naturally values structured data and automation. Using Gradle effectively and ironically breaks both these things. We need to do better. So what does that “better” look like?</p>
<p>I actually think Maven got it 90% right. A coworker has a line I really like, that highlights some of what I believe Maven got right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your builds are not special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% this.</p>
<p>This first thing I like about the Maven model is it discourages doing crazy things! Virtually all builds are just pointing at some source files, referencing some jars, and compiling. Maybe we push the end result somewhere when we’re done. Why on earth are we using a general purpose programming language to declare what should almost always be copying and pasting from a template.</p>
<p>Conversely, Maven discourage hacks and one-offs by limiting us to a purely declarative format. If we <em>really</em> need something special, we have a plugin framework where we can punch out of the stricter declarative world, and then we’re just coding in Kotlin. Boom! Do all the crazy your heart desires.</p>
<p>The other thing Maven got right is having a strict convention and format. This is really where the power lies for large organizations. It’s a simple enough “language” that parsers are multiple and battle tested. How far do you have to reach in a given language to parse and understand XML? In any mainstream language you probably have multiple options. Not just regexes.</p>
<p>This is exactly why Maven tooling has always been so out-of-the-box functional. The structure is well-defined, and there are fewer unexpected things because one-off hacks are discouraged. Gradle tooling on the other hand has always been near non-existent. IntelliJ supports Gradle and does a decent job, but it was a long road to get here. The support was incredibly buggy in early days, and even now seems a little flaky. Meanwhile, Maven tooling has just quietly worked this whole time.</p>
<p>Of course what Maven didn’t get right was XML. Maven was written at the time we all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">collective insanity</a> and thought everything should be XML. We’re still kinda dealing with the hangover. XML has a lot of properties that are great for builds, but is a total eyesore.</p>

<p>I want something Maven like, but no XML. Right off the bat I don’t think YAML is the right thing here, we want something simpiler and stricter. I’m honestly not sure if a format like this exists, but I’m shouting into the void and hoping a response comes back. If one doesn’t exist maybe we need to <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">make one</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my build tool and language I want something that has these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Strict and static. Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ yelled at us if we forgot a mandatory argument? Wouldn’t it be great if IntelliJ told us an argument we were using on a plugin is deprecated? Wouldn’t it be great if we could do a “Find Usages” on a dependency or plugin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple. Writing interpreters for this should be easy so automated tools can do their thing. Even better, the build tool itself provides an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An accessible and rich plugin and lifecycle API. Maybe one of the mistakes of Maven was it was too strict, and that led to Gradle. Let’s try to meet in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support rich documentation. This is where XML is especially brutal. What if we could click on the argument of a plugin, and IntelliJ would bring us to well-formatted documentation. 😍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No meaningful whitespace please. We should have learned this was a bad idea a long time ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First class fat-jars! No Kotlin or Java build tool has this as a first-class feature, and literally every JVM developer I know uses them<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.  The whole JVM world is just relying on some guys <a href="https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow">side project</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s a big ask, but I think we need something new. When I look at the herculean efforts made towards the development of Gradle, I can’t help but think it could be redirected to something smaller and simpler. This is such core part of our development workflow. I think it’s worth the investment.</p>

		<p>Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development &amp; learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. At Replit, our goal is to give people coding superpowers by demolishing barriers and democratizing access to expert tools. Today, we're launching our zero-setup unit testing environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/unit_tests/unit_tests.gif" alt="unit tests demo"></p>
<p>At launch we'll support three of our most popular programming languages: Java, Python, and JavaScript pre-setup with the most popular frameworks in each category. We'll be adding more with time, and you can visit our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/UnitTesting">docs</a> for more information about how to get started.</p>
<p>We think this feature will be handy for CS educators, online course creators, and developers. But as always, we're excited to explore unique ways people will leverage this feature. So let us know how you use it!</p>

		<p><span>TL;DR:</span> Ada is an extremely interesting and robust programming language that has a lot to offer modern developers of system 
	and bare-metal software. At very least, Ada presents many interesting ideas that designers of modern programming languages could stand to learn much from. If you want a 30 second version of this article, check out the 
	<a href="#practical_example">practical example</a> that I provide for a comparison of Ada with C.</p>

<p>
	Much of the technical material presented in this article is available as part of <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Ajxs">my contributions</a> to <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev.org</a>
</p>
<p>
	I consider myself a rational man. While I may believe in an entirely deterministic model of the universe, I certainly
	do not believe it to be guided by any conscious process.
	I do not believe in destiny. This absence of guidance makes such fortuitous occurrences as the one I will discuss all
	the more extraordinary, and for this I am all the more grateful.
</p>

<h2>A Chance Collision</h2>
<p>
	By no deliberate design of my own, I happen to live close to a university. Not in the kind of ‘University town’ common
	to much of Europe or the United States, but in the densely packed suburban sprawl of the inner-city. My regular walk
	to and from the local shopping centre takes me past several of the buildings belonging to the highly regarded
	engineering faculty of the aforementioned University.
</p>
<p>
	Making my way home one serendipitous afternoon, I happened across a sizeable stack of books sitting on the curb
	outside one of the University’s engineering buildings. The university was ostensibly in the process of liquidating its stockpile
	of old engineering books, and had left them in a pile for the local council to collect. Amongst material covering a
	wide variety of academic disciplines, two books in particular caught my eye: <i>Building Parallel, Embedded, and
	Real-Time Applications with Ada</i>, and <i>Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada</i>.
</p>
<p>
	I had heard of Ada before. I understood that it came from a pedigree of languages developed for the United States
	military, and that it still occupied a niche in the development of safety-critical applications, nothing more.
	Curious, I threw the books in my bag and off I went.
</p>


<h2>Exceeding My Expectations</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I had pictured Ada’s syntax resembling the uncompromising verbosity and rigid construction of COBOL, or
	perhaps the Lovecraftian hieroglyphics of Fortran’s various eldritch incarnations. Turning the pages, I was pleasantly
	surprised by modern constructs associated with modern high-level languages such as ranges, slicing and
	exception-handling. The syntax — Admittedly verbose by modern standards<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup> — seemed deliberately and purposefully
	constructed to make the language comprehensible at a glance.</p>
<p>The fact that Ada was designed with embedded-software in mind was of particular interest to me. I already had some
	limited experience with bare-metal development on the x86 and ARM platforms using C and assembly, so the prospect of
	using higher-level constructs on bare-metal seemed promising to me.</p>

<h2>Not the Camel You Expected</h2>
<p>A common pejorative refrain directed at Ada by its many detractors is that it is a language “designed by committee”,
	or even worse, a language “designed by committee <i>for the military</i>”<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. The implication of which being that (so-called)
	design by committee precludes it from any real-world practicality. I contend that it is better to design a language to fit an
	existing problem domain than to pick your weapon of choice and set out in search of new problem domains to apply it
	to<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>. I will spare readers a detailed retelling of Ada’s conception within the Department of Defence’s <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/holwg-93.htm">‘High Order
	Language Working Group’</a>, save to say that the Ada programming language was born of the need for single, unified
	higher-level language suitable for use in the multitude of Real-Time Embedded systems developed by the DoD<sup><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup>. In the
	wise words of the working-group’s chair, Colonel William A. Whitaker: “It was concluded that no existing language
	could be adopted as a single common high order language for the DoD, but that a single language meeting essentially
	all the requirements was both feasible and desirable.”. If such a thing was indeed feasible, the DoD’s deep pockets
	would help it bring it into existence. Ironically, given its status as the de-facto standard language of modern embedded-system development, the C language was considered unsuitable for this purpose: “When Bell Labs were
	invited to evaluate C against the DoD requirements, they said that there was no chance of C meeting the requirements
	of readability, safety, etc.” (Whitaker, 1993). After its successful implementation, in what would prove a controversial decision, the DoD would go so far as to mandate 
	the use of Ada for all in-house software engineering.</p>

<h2>So What Makes It Special?</h2>
<p>
	Ada has many useful features that are of particular interest for low-level programming and operating-system development. One
	feature in particular that impressed me greatly was Ada’s <i>representation clauses</i> (see below). They provide a highly granular way to define the
	in-memory representation of low-level data structures. I was very quickly able to adapt my own long suffering operating-system development project to Ada, improving the
	quality of my codebase greatly in the process. The following section details some of Ada’s features:
</p>

<h3>Custom Types</h3>
<p>
	In addition to being a strongly typed language, Ada allows for the definition of new scalar, enumerated and record types.
	Custom primitive types can also be constrained to a predefined range of values.
	The example below demonstrates the definition of a new integer type based upon Ada’s native <code>Natural</code> type, restricted
	to a predefined range.
	The use of the subtype directive informs the compiler that other variables of the <code>Natural</code> type are compatible with
	the newly defined subtype.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
<span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>24</span><span>;</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Col</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>subtype</span> <span>Row</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The below example illustrates the creation of incompatible custom integer types. While their base type and range
	constraints are identical, Ada treats both as separate, incompatible types. An assignment of a variable of one type
	to the value of another is illegal, and will trigger a compile-time error.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>A</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
<span>B</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>A</span><span>;</span> <span>-- illegal!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The following example demonstrates the creation of a custom enumerated type. It also demonstrates a subtype of an enumerated type with a constrained range of values.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span><span>Monday</span><span>,</span> <span>Tuesday</span><span>,</span>
  <span>Wednesday</span><span>,</span> <span>Thursday</span><span>,</span> <span>Friday</span><span>,</span> <span>Saturday</span><span>,</span> <span>Sunday</span><span>);</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Work_Day</span> <span>is</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>range</span> <span>Monday</span> <span>..</span> <span>Friday</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	A variable with the type of <code>Work_Day</code> is restricted to its constrained range. Any attempt to assign a value outside
	of this range to a variable of this type will raise a <code>Constraint_Error</code> exception at runtime.
</p>

<h2>Representation Clauses</h2>
<p>
	Ada allows for explicitly defining the in-memory representation of scalar and compound types. The following example
	demonstrates the definition of a record type (equivalent to structures in C), as well as its associated
	representation in memory.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The format of the System Table Descriptor pointer used by the processor</span>
<span>--  to load descriptor tables like the GDT and IDT.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>is</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>:</span> <span>Unsigned_16</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>:</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end record</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>48</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>use</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span>  <span>..</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>16</span> <span>..</span> <span>47</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>record</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>System_Table_Descriptor</code> type must be 48 bits in size. The
	record representation clause instructs the compiler as to the required layout of this record type in memory. This
	example specifies that the <code>Size</code> member should occupy bits 0 to 15, and the <code>Offset</code> member should occupy bits 16 to
	47. This feature is analogous to C’s bit-fields. The following example demonstrates defining the in-memory
	representation of an enumerated type.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The privilege level for a particular descriptor.</span>
<span>--  These correspond to the 'protection ring' that this descriptor is</span>
<span>--  accessible from.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>use</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>3</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</code> type must be 2 bits in size.
	The representation clause instructs the compiler as to required representation of each possible value of the
	enumerated type in memory. In this example the value of <code>Ring_0</code> will be represented by a value of <code>0x0</code> in memory, the
	value of <code>Ring_1</code> will be represented by <code>0x1</code>, and so on.
</p>

<h2 id="practical_example">A Practical Example</h2>

<p>
	The following example, and accompanying comparison with C, demonstrates the configuration of a hypothetical UART device by interfacing with an 8-bit memory-mapped configuration register.

<div><pre><span></span><span>with</span> <span>System.Storage_Elements</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>System.Storage_Elements</span><span>;</span>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fNp37zFn9Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:articleBody">

<p>Mainframes entered the market in the early 1950's when IBM and the seven dwarfs (Burroughs, Unisys, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, GE, and RCA) created the computing age and competed for critical applications, sophisticated modeling, and large-scale transactions and workloads among the largest of organizations.&nbsp; Over the past seven decades, compute power, storage, and networking have seen various waves of centralization and decentralization amidst each wave of disruptive technology adoption.</p>

<p>As with each wave, pundits, analysts, and industry watchers have forecasted the death of the mainframe.&nbsp; Yet, the venerable mainframe has prevailed.&nbsp; In a Q4 2020 update on mainframe usage, IBM shared the following statistics on mainframe adoption:</p>

<ul>
	<li>67 of the Fortune 100;</li>
	<li>45 of the top 50 Banks;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Insurers;</li>
	<li>8 of the top 10 Telcos;</li>
	<li>7 of the top 10 Retailers;</li>
	<li>4 of the top 5 Airlines;</li>
</ul>

<p>use the mainframe.</p>

<p>While it may be one thing to tout usage of a technology by which organizations continue to adopt a technology, IBM has grown usage as measured by MIPS, a method of calculating the raw speed used, by 350% over the past ten years.</p>



<p>The newest mainframes include the latest <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2018/0417-01.html">Fujitsu GS21 </a>series announced April 2018 along with Fujitsu Software GSS21sx V20 which supports connections with open systems. In September 2019, IBM launched the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/hardware">IBM Z15 </a>showcasing key capabilities such as encryption anywhere, cloud native development, and instant recovery.&nbsp; From many conversations with CIO's in healthcare, travel, financial services, and pharma, the mainframe continues to play a key role in their overall modernization strategies.&nbsp; For many of these organizations, they are working with public cloud vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud while keeping their intense workloads on the mainframe for both cost and security reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, many competitive industry leaders value a hybrid approach with cloud and mainframe as a trusted, efficient architecture for their enterprise organizations delivering intense hybrid workloads from securely filing a healthcare claim, making life-saving prescriptions, booking travel, initiating a credit check, and reducing fraud in banking online.&nbsp; A hybrid approach enables top businesses to apply the right technologies to the right workloads to reduce their risk.&nbsp; Why? Elasticity, distributed compute and storage, and shared infrastructure have continued to withstand the test of time.&nbsp; As the CIO of a Fortune 50 financial services entity noted, "The security, performance, reliability, and value equation of the mainframe give us confidence to continue with our hybrid approach.&nbsp; The cost of data movement and I/O costs would be punishingly expensive with our current public cloud contracts"</p>

<p>Moreover, investments by organizations such as Broadcom and IBM's in Zowe, the open mainframe project, enable all users to access an integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS.&nbsp; Users can use one language to access open systems and open software through a set of common APIs and OS capabilities.&nbsp; Consequently, developers can use the same tools for the cloud and mainframe enabling a broader set of developers and resources to work on both.&nbsp; The numbers show this as well with 94 of the top 100 IBM Z Enterprises are running Linux on Z and able to modernize with the mainframe.&nbsp; In addition, a 2019 survey of mainframe professionals conducted by Forrester for IBM showed that nearly 90% of professionals in enterprise computing careers agree the job market for their skill set is growing, and 75% believe there is a high demand for their skills in mainframe.</p>



<p>The growth of mainframe adoption has come at the same time the public cloud has expanded.&nbsp; Constellation estimates that 20% of the world's workloads are now in the public cloud.&nbsp; As adoption continues, co-existence of mainframe, on-premises, and cloud deployments will continue for at least the next decade.&nbsp; In a 2020 Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/hello-mainframe-our-old-friend.html">survey</a> also confirmed that mainframe usage continues to grow with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>74% believe the mainframe has a long-term viability as a strategic platform for their organizations</li>
	<li>91% identified expanding their mainframe footprints as a moderate or critical priority in the next 12 months</li>
	<li>72% are planning upgrades to their mainframe in the next three years</li>
</ul>

<p>While public cloud usage has gained ground, hybrid cloud approaches have become mainstream among top organizations.&nbsp; Many business and technology leaders have expanded and grown their existing investments in mainframe for their critical next gen computing environments. In fact, businesses rely on both the cloud and mainframe to lead digital transformation efforts built on trust to achieve peace of mind, with speed, security, versatility, elasticity, and scale on demand in a hybrid environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As leaders move forward, they should focus on getting the most out of their cloud and mainframe investments to improve organizational ROI.&nbsp; Modernizing on the mainframe can be done in concert with distributed and cloud platforms.&nbsp; Balancing out data gravity and I/O costs will determine which technology to place transactional processing and critical workloads.&nbsp; In the meantime, teams can easily use the same tools and standards such as open source across all platforms including mainframe.&nbsp; Form always follows function and tech decisions must match the business use case.&nbsp; Constellation expects mainframe to play not only a key role for decades to come, but also to expand its footprint in the overall technology and business strategy of leading organizations.</p>

					<br><h2>Welcome to geezer town, junior.</h2>
<p>While researching my recent article, “<a title="Article on Age Discrimination by yours truly" href="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/04/20/age-discrimination-and-programming-jobs/" target="_self">Age discrimination and Programming Jobs</a>”&nbsp;, I discovered a <a title="NYT Article: &quot;Now Hiring, if you're young.&quot;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/opinion/now-hiring-if-you-re-young.html" target="_blank">1998 Op-Ed piece from The New York Times</a>&nbsp;that cited some startling statistics from the NSF and Census bureau about the longevity of a software engineering career.</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]ix years after finishing college, 57 percent of computer science graduates are working as programmers; at 15 years the figure drops to 34 percent, and at 20 years — when most are still only in their early 40’s — it is down to 19 percent. In contrast, the figures for civil engineering are 61 percent, 52 percent and 52 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p><img data-attachment-id="677" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/retiredprogrammer/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg" data-orig-size="210,210" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RetiredProgrammerButton" data-image-description="<p>Retired programmer button</p>
" data-medium-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" data-large-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=210" title="RetiredProgrammerButton" src="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=468" alt="RetiredProgrammerButton" srcset="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg 210w, https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/retiredprogrammer.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px">I find the defensive tone of the article and the use of dubious sampling of only computer science graduates to support its conclusion undermines its credibility. In a lot of ways, the Government has been very slow to grok the software engineering trade. In this study it completely ignores the significant number of working programmers who either earned their degree in another discipline or never finished college.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Still, smart money seems to concur that the software engineer depreciates only slightly more slowly than the machine he or she toils behind as exemplified in this 1996 comment from <a title="Craig Barrett Bio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Barrett_(businessman)" target="_blank">Craig Barrett</a>, then President and Co-founder of Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>The half-life of an engineer, software or hardware, is only a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, the guy’s a suit, but more importantly he was (at the time) a 57 year old former engineer publicly reinforcing the discriminatory notion of expiration dates on other engineers. It’s scary as hell to think that such an influential industry insider thinks that a programming career is roughly the same as a professional basketball player’s.</p>

<h2>My take on the issue</h2>
<p>Considerable accusatory ink has been dedicated to the age discrimination problem in technology, but I suspect it may be an inevitable consequence of the rapid pace of change that defines this field.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The market value of an employee is primarily determined by experience in technologies relevant to the employer.</li>
<li>Software engineering reliably undergoes a major technology shift at least every 10 years.</li>
<li>While a technology shift doesn’t completely negate the skills of veterans, it certainly levels the playing field for recent grads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a prospective hiring manager using a newer technology like Ruby on Rails for which nobody other than <a title="Creator of Rails" href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html" target="_blank">David Heinemeier</a>has more than about 5 years of experience. &nbsp;Sure, that extra 10 years of C++ experience is a positive differentiator for the veteran over the upstart with the same 3 years of Rails experience.&nbsp; All things equal you’d naturally hire the guy with more total experience.</p>
<p>However, all things are NOT equal. Those 10 years of C++ experience made the veteran candidate progressively more expensive as they leveraged the value of that experience in jobs requiring C++. The problem is that the marginal utility of that extra experience must exceed the marginal cost of hiring the veteran to justify paying the premium.</p>
<p>Herein is the source of the problem. The more irrelevant experience a candidate has, the more lopsided the utility/value equation becomes, and this presumes that the manager even has the luxury of paying extra to get that experience.</p>
<p>Even if the veteran prices himself competitively with a younger candidate, the hiring manager has to consider the implications of bringing in someone taking a big pay cut. Will they have morale issues from day one? Are they going to change their mind after a month that they really do need that extra cash and leave? It’s a sticky situation.</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that unlike other forms of discrimination that are more arbitrary and capricious, age discrimination can often be a result of objective and sound business justifications. I’m not trying to justify it as an acceptable practice, but just trying to describe the pickle it puts the manager in trying to make a sound business decision without compromising the ethical and legal obligations of the company.</p>
<h2>So what’s your plan B?</h2>
<p>Assuming you aren’t fabulously wealthy, accepted to clown college, or the fatal victim of a Red-bull induced heart attack by 40 a mitigation strategy is in order. Here are some viable options.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="678" data-permalink="https://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/chooseadventure/" data-orig-file="https://softwareplusplus.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/chooseadventure.jpg" data-orig-size="190,310" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chooseadventure" data-image-description="<p>Choose Your Adventure Book Cover- The Cave of Time</p>

<h3>Work for the one person who would never discriminate against you.</h3>
<p>No. Not your mother. You! If you aren’t the entrepreneurial type, consider a consultancy. For some reason that I don’t completely get, a little gray hair and a smattering of experience in different technologies can create a beneficial bias for companies when they are renting brains instead of buying them outright. It may have something to do with the tendency for consultants to be vetted from higher up in the management chain where the silver foxes live.</p>



<h3>Give in to the dark side and go into management.</h3>
<p>I’d argue that a career in programming does precious little to prepare someone for management, but clearly management thinks that everyone including technologists harbors a deep longing to “graduate” into their ranks. I think it a fallacy that no one would continue to design and build software for 20 years unless they had no ambition or growth potential. However, people like me that respect such dedication to the craft are in the minority. Maybe it is best to just stop fighting it, but consider the following before taking the plunge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-level managers often make very little more, if not the same as high level engineers.</li>
<li>It gets progressively harder to keep up with new technology because you don’t work directly with it.</li>
<li>Meetings, politics and dealing with unrealistic requests will pretty much become your life.</li>
<li>You may try to avoid it, but management-speak will creep into your vocabulary (did you notice my “paradigm” comment earlier?)</li>
<li>Even when it isn’t your fault, it’s your fault.</li>
<li>Even when you make it succeed, your team should get the credit.</li>
<li>Being the wunderkind as a technologist is much easier to do in technology than management, you’ll have to check your ego at the door.</li>
<li>You will be forced to make decisions that affect people’s personal life (pay, bonus, firing, etc.) and this is hard to stomach sometimes.</li>
<li>It is very empowering, enjoyable to be able to set the agenda and sometimes say, “No. We ain’t doing that shit.”</li>
<li>Computers are predictable, people are complicated. You will eventually fantasize about robot employees.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be very rewarding, but also very challenging.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The most difficult thing in the world is to know how to do a thing and to watch someone else do it wrong without comment.<br>
-Theodore H. White.</p></blockquote>
<h3>You’ve got a cash cow, milk that sucker!</h3>
<p>I know you love programming because you like technology, so this may go against your very nature, but no one says you’ve got to jump every time some snot-nosed kid invents a new way to run byte-code. You have invested a lot of time and energy mastering the technology you use, and your experience differentiates you. Money follows scarcity, and snow-birding on an older technology, if you can stomach it, may just be the way to protect your earning potential. The industry turns on a dime, but is slow to retire proven technology. It is highly likely that you will still be able to earn some decent coin in the technology you know and love even after a few decades.</p>

<div><p>
One of the key leadership dimensions required in our increasingly dynamic business and economic environment is a sound understanding of the big picture. Shrinking product lifecycles and corporate lifespans make it essential for those in charge of bringing to market the innovations of tomorrow to widen and extend their horizons further into the future. This course introduces a novel way of understanding how businesses and economies, as complex systems of unique business spaces, evolve and interrelate over long periods of time. It is a holistic perspective that allows us to define and analyze emerging behaviors that cannot be determined simply by examining each system part in isolation.</p><p>

In this course, we will learn about (1) a new theory of needs and value; (2) commoditization and innovation as the two fundamental forces that shape the business and economic environment; (3) the foundation of lasting corporate success—an alignment between a company’s intent and its actual approach to business; and (4) an economy’s natural behavior and its impact on the society. We will discuss examples from such companies as Apple and IBM, and will review and reassess some established and popular theoretical concepts. The framework will provide those in product management or product marketing with a valuable new tool for positioning new products, motivating teams, and crafting successful strategies.</p><u>Guest Speakers</u><p> include:</p><u>April 15</u><p>: "<strong>Science Fiction as a Business Tool</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogerspitz/" target="_blank">Roger Spitz</a></strong>, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Techistential</p><u>April 22</u><p>: "<strong>Understanding Needs in Emerging Markets</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/business/profiles/srini_venugopal" target="_blank">Srinivas Venugopal</a></strong>, Assistant Professor of Marketing at&nbsp;University of Vermont</p><u>April 29</u><p>: "<strong>Strategic Cartography: Mapping Tech Product Expansions</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitmerker/" target="_blank">Kit Merker</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at&nbsp;Nobl9</p><u>May 6</u><p>: "<strong>Market Segmentation as a Key Success Driver in a Fast-Changing World</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-whelan-a280b113/" target="_blank">Jennifer Whelan</a></strong>, Vice President and Head of B2B Marketing at Verizon Media</p><u>May 20</u><p>: "<strong>Complexity Trade-Offs in Companies and Economies</strong>" -&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-siegenfeld/" target="_blank">Alexander Siegenfeld</a></strong>, Graduate Student Researcher at New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) and MIT Media Lab</p><u>May 27</u><p>:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akvaal/" target="_blank">Andrew Kvaal</a></strong>, Chief Operating Officer at Ampion, Inc.</p></div>

        <p>I really don't.&nbsp; I mean I guess it's because part of me just feels 
like writing.&nbsp; I don't talk to too many people, so this is sort of my 
way of expressing myself.&nbsp; And when I do talk to people I generally 
don't say much, I just listen and ask questions.&nbsp; I don't feel my life 
is anything but ordinary, although I guess it is rather spectacular.&nbsp; I 
mean it is life after all, and I once heard that all the dead wish for 
is to be alive.<br></p><p>Not even sure why I feel the need to express 
what it is I'm thinking anyways.&nbsp; It's rather futile and meaningless.&nbsp; 
Among other things I also don't care if anyone even reads this, nor do I
 expect anyone too.&nbsp; It's almost like talking to yourself in the shower 
when no one is in the room.<br></p><p>Feels nice.</p><p>Although, I 
guess from an outsiders point of view, it might look a bit foolish.&nbsp; A 
man just rambling about nothing.&nbsp; Could be soothing I suppose, the 
distraction from your own thoughts, into the world of some one else's. 
The liberty to lose yourself, and end up in the imagination of someone 
else.&nbsp; If it's a well enough written piece, it might even spark an 
emotion, or a laugh.&nbsp; Maybe even chuckle. Unfortunately, that's not what
 you're getting today.</p><p>You're stuck with this, a rambling.<br></p><p>There
 was this one time I was just sitting there looking outside, and I 
imagined a squirrel.&nbsp; I'm sure there was probably a squirrel near by, 
but I didn't see it, so I had to imagine one.&nbsp; Granted what I imagined I
 don't think any squirrel would do, at least currently. &nbsp;</p><p>It held a
 concerto.&nbsp; It walked on stage, this imaginary stage, and started to 
conduct one of the most amazing pieces of compositions ever imagined, by
 pigeons.&nbsp; The rats of the sky.</p><p>As they flew and frolicked through
 the melody of his rhythm, it all started to fall into place.&nbsp; I would 
say I was escaping what ever it is I was doing to enjoy this, but in 
reality I had nothing to escape, I was sitting in silence with company.</p><p>Not
 sure why it was a squirrel I imagined either.&nbsp; Probably had something 
to do with the fact that another time I was sitting in silence, I saw an
 actual squirrel trying to get some from some other squirrel.&nbsp; It 
actually managed to score.</p><p>The simple things in life.&nbsp; </p><p>Now I
 probably shouldn't even publish this, I mean for all it's frankness 
it's simply yet another waste of space.&nbsp; Although it is a space that I 
enjoy wasting.&nbsp; I guess one of these days I should write something of 
value or sustenance.&nbsp; Perhaps even of use.&nbsp; </p><p>I'd probably be 
getting ahead of myself at that point though, as most things I say lack 
value, and are too light to have sustenance.&nbsp; Yet here we are.&nbsp; It's 
almost like reading a bad book, you keep turning the pages in hopes you 
will find that nugget of wisdom.</p><p>But alas it wont come, I will 
instead just torture your poor thoughts with more fluff.&nbsp; Not because I 
want too, but because I feel I must.&nbsp; Why I feel that is unknown to me, 
yet I keep writing.&nbsp; I could go down some rabbit hole of why or how you 
could do something, but that would be no fun.&nbsp; It would simply be 
literal.</p><p>Plus the poor rabbit would probably be upset you are in 
his hole.&nbsp; He would probably scream some obscenities to us anyways for 
intruding in it's hole.&nbsp; How would we even make it down this hole, I'm a
 human, and most rabbits are tiny, so I guess it would have to be some 
sort of hybrid rabbit human hole.&nbsp; I also don't even know your 
dimensions, what if you're a giant, or a spec.&nbsp; Would it even work, or 
would the hole collapse on it's self by us just being in it's presence.</p><p>Would
 the rabbit even be a he? Could be a female rabbit you know, which would
 make the intrusion that much worse.&nbsp; Not because gender plays any role 
in this rabbit hole, but because rabbit holes rhyme with foes.&nbsp; Which 
the lady rabbit would definitely consider us.&nbsp; So I guess it would be 
best to go down a manhole instead.</p><p>But the acoustics wouldn't be 
as good for the squirrel concerto.&nbsp; What a pity, because that reality 
was starting to pigeonhole me.&nbsp; Then again it's easy to throw anything 
into a hole.&nbsp; The problem turns out to be catching what ever you threw 
in before it unrolls.&nbsp; Thankfully we got rock and roll instead</p>

      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Estimating_total_knowledge_in_the_brain">Estimating total knowledge in the brain</span></h2>
<p>I am finally closer to being able to say how much knowledge a human brain can hold. Scientists have counted the number of synapses in the human brain (above 100 trillion), and came up with staggering numbers on brain capacity. However, in real life, we see the brain as an unreliable and forgetful device. For an average student, to learn 100 new French words for an exam is an effort. To memorize 45,000 words of English in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_English" title="Advanced English">Advanced English</a> collection is a feat very few achieved for the cost in time. In other words, trillions of synapses seem to contradict our struggles with mere thousands of questions we need to know to function effectively on a daily basis.
</p>
<h2><span id="SuperMemo_estimates">SuperMemo estimates</span></h2>
<p>30 years ago, using simulations of the learning process in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, I predicted that I will not see a human memorize a million <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>. Today, even a million seems like a super-optimistically high number.
</p><p><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> makes estimates easy. We can count individual questions and answers, and worry less how many bits of information get stored in the brain. The estimates are pretty inaccurate to evaluate the totality of knowledge. For example, I once computed that I am able to recognize around 30,000 human faces without even trying. Some knowledge flows in effortlessly. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> measures harder knowledge that we want to preserve due to its high value.
</p><p>For 32 years now, I have been using SuperMemo to control what knowledge I remember with high recall. In those three decades, there were a couple of breakthroughs where I could sense a significant acceleration or an increase to the quality of learning. In particular, the arrival of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> in 1999 and the employment of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> in 2006 were such booster events. However, the total number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a> in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> is not a true reflection of knowledge. In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, the tolerance for knowledge overload increases, and the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue" title="Priority queue">priority queue</a> makes it possible to focus on top priority <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">items</a>, while neglecting lesser knowledge. In other words, we can perfectly know a smaller set of items, and know a huge set of items more superficially. The only good reflection of knowledge would be to consider the probability of recall for all individual items.
</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_up_memory_retrievability">Adding up memory retrievability</span></h2>
<p>With the new <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> algorithm, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-17" title="Algorithm SM-17">Algorithm SM-17</a> (2015), we can finally take a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> of each <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item" title="Item">item</a> and estimate the chance of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Recall" title="Recall">recall</a> at any point in time with pretty good accuracy. The last tool missing in the box was a chance to take any point in time (a date), and run the estimate for all items in the entire <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a> (e.g. <i>"How much did I know on Jan 1, 2000?"</i>). The only problem with such estimates is that they are computationally expensive. Finally, in 2020, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_18" title="SuperMemo 18">SuperMemo 18</a> makes it possible to chose a selected number of time points in the lifetime of any <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection" title="Collection">collection</a>, and run total knowledge estimates. For any date, the total knowledge estimate is the sum of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> estimates for that given point in time.
</p>
<p>Total knowledge can be estimated by adding up <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_retrievability" title="Memory retrievability">memory retrievability</a> for all individual items</p>
<h2><span id="Longitudinally_largest_data_set">Longitudinally largest data set</span></h2>
<p>I safely hold the record for the longest continuous use of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="Spaced repetition">spaced repetition</a> (over 32 years at the moment of writing). I will keep the title as long as I keep learning. I was simply the first to start (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Birth_of_SuperMemo" title="Birth of SuperMemo">Birth of SuperMemo</a>). I hope to keep going as long as health permits. This is why my own collection is the best source of data today to make lifelong learning estimates (Jan 1, 2020). 
</p><p>There was a minor problem on the way however. Full record of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition_history" title="Repetition history">repetition history</a> was kept only as of 1996 (due to costs and limitations on the available storage in the late 1980s). Seemingly, this might make the first 9 year of data unreliable. However, SuperMemo can provide a reasonable simulation of repetition histories for items with a known number of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Lapse" title="Lapse">lapses</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Repetition" title="Repetition">repetitions</a>, and the last <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interval" title="Interval">interval</a>. Those simulations cut the 9 years to roughly 6-7 years, and are accurate enough to make an imperceptible difference to the final outcome unless a major incongruity hides in that early period. I bet my right hand this is not the case. I was easily able to learn at 10,000 items per year in the early years, but total <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a> estimates cut this number substantially.
</p><p>I split my 32 years of learning into 60 equal intervals and let the computational procedure run overnight. In the morning, I had a beautiful graph that I want to share for the new year 2020. The staggering conclusion is that all my perceptions about acceleration, slow downs, improved learning, or neglect were largely illusory. For 32 years, I kept building up knowledge at a remarkably steady rate. In the early years, the effort seemed a bit harder, I needed more self-discipline, there were outstanding items, long days of repetitions, etc. In the times of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> it all turn out to be fun, learning with pleasure, and learning on demand, i.e. learning mostly for a specific purpose when I needed new knowledge. My departure into unrelated areas of learning proceeded at leisurely pace. With all those seeming upheavals and changes, hardly any kink shows up in the graph. Many people misread that observation as a disappointment with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. Metaphorically speaking, I am only surprised with the smooth ride of the rocket. The speed is no less fantastic.

<h2><span id="Conceptualization_process">Conceptualization process</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate of maximum human knowledge, we need to have data that would span a 100 years period. This is how long an average human might live given a perfect lifestyle, good health, and a couple of other conditions. My 32 years of learning fall into the most uneventful period that is characterized by steady linear progress. In theory, the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a> process in the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> of the brain should begin slowly. It might possibly saturate when the ceiling of the brain size is reached. Those early and late changes in the speed of conceptualization will be reflected in the underlying speed of learning. This is illustrated in the figure with the light blue line marked as computational <b>Capacity</b>:

<h2><span id="Combining_data_from_many_users">Combining data from many users</span></h2>
<p>To make a good estimate I would need data from many users. In particular, the first 10 years of life, and the data past the age of 80 are most precious. We have surprisingly many users in those age categories, but all users learn at different speeds, use different strategies, learn different things, etc. This is why we need collections that span a decade or more. Short periods cannot be collated from many collections because they are largely uninformative. Regrettably, I have hundreds of collections submitted in various circumstances, and they mostly come from young or middle aged users. They also predominantly come from novices. To this day, I do not have any data from users above the age of 80.
</p><p>I was hoping that my own data might hint if the fifth decade of life brings some slowdown to the learning process. However, my data has been polluted with a great deal of self-experimentation. To account for artifacts of experimental learning, I needed extra correction procedures. In the end, depending on the method, I received a different verdict. My learning might have slowed down a bit, or it might have actually accelerated (my unreliable perception leans towards the latter).
</p><p>By combining data from collections of users at different ages I arrived at a hypothetical course of learning in a lifetime. Unfortunately, the projected slowdown after 70 is just a hypothesis. I tried to imagine myself in a wheelchair at 100, and the mere loss of mobility, I imagine, would undermine my ability to progress with learning at the present rate. I have no data to prove the slowdown. It is just a common sense speculation and my best guess based on four decades of analysis and deliberations on the nature of learning.

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi

        <span>leaq</span>    (%rsi,%rdi), %rax
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();
</span>    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and, again, let’s see <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tEJICcpLegAyeWpgByxgEaZiIAGykADqgWE6rR6hiaCfgFqdHYOzkZuHt5KKlG0DATMxAQhxqYWisqYqkHpmQQxTq7uXooZWTlhnLVlFXEJXgCUiqgGxMgcAORSAMz2yIZYANTiwzrICgT49DPY4gAMAILrGwvEBqqTAGpFktMA7LKbk9eT9gSe3AD6BJMAHjOXGze39A/PkwBPD7bb4AN1QeHQkywLgMwAACsQ7hAOpM0LQFsDNuIzgARLFbTZ3P4vWgkIwMACOBkymHQEGOyFOoNROM%2BYIAdDC4YjkR0Cd9iJgCL1aJNQRzXpMAFTiyXTGRygEypUEnG4gZdVggAYAVgGpFMAzWBtQOp0cjkkwUPT6mAVw04BoIOpNHS6AGsQMNhhyff6A4HvNqBtwDUaTaQzQMDQoQGtSC7jZrSHBYEg0EYfHh2GQKBBM9ncyhhKJOJw1k0qDmCO44xAXK6DS57JkATqnaRM0YtAQAPK0Vjt5OkLBGETAdhN0d4IXFUGYOMjzCvIoGWsdg13ZSboR4FzENt6LC7ghIoybro0ehMNgcHj8QSlsSWmR7lxxyBdVA%2BVJLgC0fbDJM/4LOgMy4hIMhyJIkbJEUqSaNoDSmE01itFUHhNBEgR0Ch4T%2BLhtAYfE1RNPBxR0KU9T6LkggUak1HlPYlSkVhzQ0aEqEccxsSYVwXQ2r0/QCUIOr6oa07Rq8AAcnj/g8aLPpM5YcmsHKcJMEC4IQJAOk0kx6FmObuPpqIWtBMjOk27qkF6Pp%2BoGTk%2BsGOphpJI7RrG8aJjZqYwIgKCoMZubkJQhYmR44wTuWlakNWrC1sQ9aNiOLa0G2u7dr2A5DtOY4TlOI74HOagLkukYrmuG4DJ224hpGrD7oexAAsegyRmeeAXrVKbXowLBTg%2BAiSEIE4oK%2B8hNR%2B8Dfr%2BQQAUBIFgRBUGyDIsGxoUlGmBA1j4Zwo3oSxbRkcMviEakB2jThqQke0nDnQxJR1NktGNKNz1Ua991nTx108b9WHDIJtoiZwWrieGUk6rJ8mKdFogqZwakaVpOlEMQ%2BmkIZwVFqZIySOZk3Wcmtn2b6znOWJobQ55OreQmSZupDAySHTkZeb5ZNdAuyVBCA3BAA">the generated assembly</a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>subq</span>    <span>$24</span>, %rsp

</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function
epilogue</a>),
and then return to our caller with <code>retq</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s look at a different example. Suppose that we want to print
an uppercased C string and we’d like to avoid heap allocations for
smallish strings.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> We might write something like

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I don’t normally enjoy writing controversial posts about why new technologies are bad; I LOVE it! So here we go! We’re starting a new large-scale first-party project over at <a href="https://themadbotter.com/">The Mad Botter</a> (sorry no details today) that requires a significant level of low-level engineering work on Linux.  Initially, we considered using some sort of solution like CYthon to compile Python to native code, but we ultimately decided against it. That led us to look at compiled languages.  Spoiler alert! We went with C++.  Before you flip your lid, here’s why. </p>



<p><strong>Multiple Platforms / Native Code</strong>:  Sure, I’ve spent a lot of energy trying to find cross-platform solutions that work well and the solution I came to is that are always compromises that aren’t the ones that I care to make; with that said, there’s a lot of good reasons to go with more traditionally write once run everywhere solutions. C++ allows us to have shared code (with some platform specific modifications to be sure)  compiled  for each of our desired platforms while also having specific modules to take advantage platform specific features.  A key point here is that by platforms we are not just talking about operating systems but also processor architectures; I’m looking at you Apple Silicon</p>



<p><strong>Modern C++:</strong> Over the last few releases C++ has seen some changes that aim to sand down some of the rougher edges of the language. Collections and memory management have been getting a lot of good attention in the last few releases. In particular, we found smart pointers to be particularly attractive; dare I say they are downright familiar at least on their face to this Objective-C die-hard fan; yes, I am still pining for my square brackets!</p>



<p><strong>Team Familiarity: </strong>OK, so this is a bit of a weak one in terms of technical reasons, but it’s actually pretty important. Compared to the competing low-level languages (Go and Rust), all of the team has at least some experience in C++ with some of us having quite a bit of experience in the language. While it shouldn’t drive all technical decisions, experience is a factor. </p>



<p>Before landing on C++ we ended up with three languages in the running at the end of the process: C++, C# (.Net) and Rust. C# was eliminated first for a few reasons including some extra hoops to work in it on Linux and macOS; having said that, .Net is much easier to develop in on Linux and macOS now than it ever was before. Rust almost took the cup and <a href="https://coder.show/">Coder Radio</a> listeners will know I am a Rust fan, but ultimately the existing C++ experience on the team carried the day and like a vinyl record collection at a hipster swap-meet, it’s golden.  Let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/dominucco">Twitter</a> and if you’re in need of Python, IOT or mobile development, reach out! A</p>

<p><em><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05ccbc28">Listen to narrated version</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How many should be teaching people how to succeed instead of just succeeding in their own way?</strong></p>
<p>As independent creators carve out a new career path for themselves, I suspect that some are unintentionally picking a path that limits their growth and robs the world of their true potential.</p>
<p>This theory was triggered by this Hunter Walk tweet:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s1btlni3fe2mzxhghkm6.png" alt="Hunter Walk: the emerging newsletter playbook seems to be &quot;B-Players Writing About A-Players While Being Subscribed to by C-Players&quot;">
</p>
<p>The message is clear: By doing B player things, you are at least doing better than C players. <strong>But you will <em>never</em> be an A player using the B player playbook.</strong></p>
<p>Is that a tradeoff you are consciously making?</p>
<p>Of course it is too reductive to reduce pluripotent people to "A players" and "B players". You can be both in different domains, or transition from one to the other. And of course this is nowhere near as bad as the real-life "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ceiling">glass ceiling</a>" or a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling">bamboo ceiling</a>" in normal careers, where a certain set of the workforce is unable to progress by sheer fact of <em>who they are</em>. That is obviously despicable and is a far more important societal issue.</p>
<p>But the meta-creator ceiling is interesting to me because it is a path that new creators <strong>follow by choice,</strong> yet <em>without being aware of it's limitations</em> because nobody is incentivized to warn them. Perhaps because it is an easier game than others, or perhaps because of hype and marketing.</p>
<p>No judgment — I of all people know that there are many ways to avoid asking what it is I really want to do with my life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some definitions are in order: <strong>A "Meta-Creator" is someone who creates content about creating, instead of just creating.</strong></p>
<p>The temptation toward being a Meta-Creator is extremely high. There are three paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The A-B-C Loop</strong>: People want success porn. They are oblivious to the <a href="https://medium.com/@coffeeandjunk/cognitive-bias-narrative-fallacy-9cff93a597b2">narrative fallacy</a> and ignore luck and complicating details. Your success creating success porn gains you access to more successful people who are only too happy to let you write their hagiography. You can spend an entire career mythologizing successful people, living a life of a bard rather than a hero. Always the vibesmaid, never the vibe.</li>
  <li><strong>The Creator Strange Loop:</strong> To <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_kiely/status/1349361401316446211?s=20">quote the always-brilliant Philip Kiely</a>: "First you do X, then you make content about doing X, then you make content about that content... One day you realize you haven't done X for six months. And there is only so much room for content at the highest levels of abstraction." Every single step makes logical sense because you have credibility from having just done the thing. After a while every step you take you wind back up at the same spot because you're in the generic Creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">strange loop</a> everyone has pigeonholed you in.</li>
  <li><strong>The Audience-Building Loop:</strong> The natural end game of the current <strong>Audience-First</strong> and <strong>Build in Public</strong> memes is that you naturally attract an audience of wannabe builders. There are only so many topics they want to buy, and so many things to incestuously sell to each other. The successful cohorts will be supported by the far bigger unsuccessful ones in a self-organizing pyramid scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be extremely clear: You can be enormously successful and happy being a Meta-Creator, and bring success and happiness to millions, and that is no small feat. I enjoy Tim Ferris' podcasts and Tren Griffin's blogposts. No judgment if that's your thing. The economics make sense too — in a gold rush, go mine a bit of gold, then sell copies of the shovel you used because it is now proven to work. Just don't spend too long thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1284597930398105600?s=20">who arranged those economics in the first place</a>.</p>
<p>But, one, you may have a lower chance of success pursuing this path than others, because it is both available to everyone and zero-sum.</p>
<p>But I write for reason two: the sneaking suspicion that <em>even if you win</em> and are top of the heap at the Meta-Creator game, you are still limiting yourself from what you could be doing with your life. What the people you <em>actually</em> look up to are doing with theirs. What the world could be benefiting from if the greatest minds of our generation just applied themselves to other problems than "How to Crush it on Twitter" or "Get a Million YouTube Subscribers" or the 3923rd "How Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Think" blogpost.</p>
<p>Smart, capable people like you and I can often approach life with more ambition than direction. We want success more than we want to solve problems. I think the way to approach the question of "what do I do to be successful", may be to flip it on its head:</p>
<p>Assume you will be successful at whatever game you play. <strong>Are you playing a game you want to win?</strong></p>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

<p>On day one of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/09/lessons-learned-on-an-engineering-manager-job-search/">my new job</a>, my manager tried to warn me:</p>



<blockquote><p>You’re going to struggle with imposter syndrome on this team. I struggled with it. Everyone does. It’s a part of the job.</p></blockquote>



<p>I didn’t believe him. I brushed it off with a self-deprecating joke about my enormous ego. And for the first month or so, I was fine. But then I wasn’t. </p>



<p>Imposter syndrome is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">sneaky son of a bitch</a>. It took me another month to realize that’s what I was feeling. </p>



<p>In hindsight, it should have been obvious. I didn’t pay any attention to the good stuff. A <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a> team member or a piece of positive feedback was happenstance and good luck, obviously. That all would have happened even if I didn’t join, obviously. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Any manager</a> in my shoes would have done that, obviously.</p>



<p>But whenever I found a scrap of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">negativity</a> or unhappiness or <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">disagreement</a>, my brain said “AHA! I knew it! Told ya chump, you don’t belong here!” That went on until today, when I was writing a stream of consciousness post. I realized mid-sentence that this is good old fashioned imposter syndrome. It’s so stereotypical that it’s downright boring.</p>



<p>But the tricky bit is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">breaking the cycle</a>, because it’s self-fulfilling. Here’s how it goes down for me:</p>



<ul><li>Step 1: Feel like an imposter</li><li>Step 2: Feel the urge to earn respect and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">be liked</a> to prove that I’m not an imposter</li><li>Step 3: Try to please everyone rather than pushing for <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">what I think is best</a> which may upset people </li><li>Step 4: Come across as wishy washy and inexperienced</li><li>Step 5: Notice that, and go back to step 1.</li></ul>



<p>By feeling like an imposter, I end up acting like one. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">We become what we are told we are</a>, and I told myself that I’m an imposter.</p>



<p>I have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/01/making-success-controllable/">kill step 3</a>. Please excuse me while I hype myself up to do that:</p>



<ul><li>I’ve been on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/02/whats-in-a-team-name/">dozens of teams</a> over the past 13 years. </li><li>I’ve <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/08/becoming-a-leader-the-hard-and-only-way/">led most of them</a>, and they’ve all been successful.</li><li>People usually like me OK, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/11/who-cares-if-youre-liked/">it’s ok if some don’t</a>.</li><li>And a lame appeal to authority: I’ve read <em>so many books</em> about this stuff.</li></ul>



<p>I know what I’m doing. The only way to <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/18/consistency-beats-quality/">break the cycle</a> is to go do it. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
<p>I got a chance to deeply learn about OSS (Open Source Software) while I was doing my Master's degree in 2016. I've been researching open source development since then, and I fell in love with its collaborative nature and the way of writing and using software. Since then, I've been advocating for open source projects, and supporting the OSS community in many different ways. What strikes me the most about open source development is that its collaborative nature allows innovation at a fast pace and I believe that it can result in many future discoveries.</p>
<p>Although open source is very popular now, it has been defined as an actual term in the late 70's and early 80's. For those who are not familiar with the term, open source is a technology development and distribution model, where everything is done in public - from setting a roadmap to develop new features, fix bugs, code review to source code, to name a few. Normally, there is a governing board, usually formed by hobbyists, a company, or a foundation, that publicly manages the project.</p>
<p>Open source is everywhere! From the smallest embedded systems to the computers, cellphones, and infrastructure of the companies we engage with every day.  When you stream Netflix on your home, for example, you fire up Amazon web services, most of which run on Linux, one of the biggest open source projects. If you have an Android cellphone, then you use Linux in your everyday life. Despite that, many applications in the next generation of technology are open source. For example, Google open sourced its artificial intelligence engine called TensorFlow in 2015.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, open source is now embraced by big tech companies. For example, IBM plans to pay $34 billion for the open source company Red Hat, and Microsoft paid $7.5 billion to acquire the code hosting and collaboration platform GitHub. Finally, Walmart has just released its own open source software [1].</p>
<p><strong>So, at this point, you might be asking yourself why would a company open source their projects?</strong></p>
<p>For a lot of reasons. Let's take the aforementioned Tensorflow as an example. When Google open sourced Tensorflow, it not only enabled companies, researchers, and hobbyists to build applications using the technology the tech giant uses to do translation tasks, for example, but also to have outside developers to make their software better and adapt it to each person's needs. Currently, more than 1,300 developers outside Google have worked on TensorFlow.</p>
<p>And in this case, what is the advantage of open sourcing Tensorflow? It's pretty simple! By open sourcing the tool, Google helped TensorFlow to become one of the standard frameworks for developing AI applications, which can boost other tech fields that depend on AI. Additionally, open source serves as valuable marketing. After Google has open sourced Tensorflow, Dropbox and Airbnb have used TensorFlow to recognize text in documents and photographs.</p>
<p>Another example is the Chinese tech giant Tencent that has open sourced its microservices framework TARS. TARS now is an open source foundation and it is helping to build a strong community of microservice open source software. After TARS has become open source, not only has TARS grown in terms of the number of functionalities developed by developers all over the world, but it has also helped the project to attract and retain technical talent.</p>
<p>I hope that at this stage I have convinced you the many advantages when open sourcing a software project. So, let's take a look at the main reasons why you should either open source your project, use open source software or contribute to open source development.</p>
<p><strong>Vendor neutrality</strong><br>
Open source software enables vendor neutrality. That means that no matter if you are a user, a company, or a country, you are not locked in to another company's technical stack, road map or licensing agreements [2]. Soon in the future, chip designers won't be locked into Intel or ARM with RISC-V. Thanks to the OpenRAN project, 5G network builders won't be forced to buy from Huawei, Nokia, or Ericsson, for example [2].</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
You might be thinking that by open sourcing a project, it becomes more vulnerable to attacks. The fact is that when exposing the codebase publicly, security experts have easy access to test it and improve the technology security. The operating system Linux and the cloud container orchestration system Kubernetes are good examples for security in open source.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration &amp; Sharing Leads to Innovation</strong><br>
Community is the core of open source development. Contributing in a diverse and innovative environment helps to create an innovative organization for three reasons. First, developers will need to work with other people, explain how things work as well as ask for help (especially if you are a newcomer in the community :-) ). The acts of learning and teaching can bring a lot to everyone involved [3]. Second, open source communities have people with different skills, experiences, nationalities, and gender. By valuing an inclusive environment and having a lot of diversity, teams may become more innovative. Finally, open source has practices around transparency, reduction in hierarchy, and open communication, which encourage motivation and an innovative mindset.</p>
<p>To conclude, open source development depends on a passionate community of developers. To succeed in open source, I believe that there must be a continued collaboration between users, developers, and companies. Although open source development might have its issues (as every thing in life), the pros are more than the cons. Diverse team builds better projects, and better software is what open source is about.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">Database Normalization</a> can be complicated. The definitions of the various "normal forms" are academic and not very practical. All this can leave one feeling lost. Hopefully, this guide can help. <strong>This guide aims to be a practical, succinct guide to database normalization for the working software engineer.</strong> In what follows we will look at the first few normal forms and their properties in simple language. (If you just want a table of normal forms and their properties, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-columns-and-special-columns">Basic columns and special columns</h2>
<p>In what follows I will refer to table columns as either "basic columns" or "special columns". When I say "basic", I really just mean "not special", which raises the core question of: <strong>What is meant by "special column"? Simply put, a special column is a column you could use to uniqely identify rows within a table.</strong><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> It is of critical important in database normalization to identify all the special columns of a table. This might naively seem easy to do, but determining the special columns of a table can quickly become a subtle and debatable business.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special column that is always straightforward, and will show up in essentially every production database table you will ever interact with: the serial <code>id</code> column. It's basically the <em>most</em> special column of all because it exists for the sole purpose of uniquely identifying rows in a table. It's so special in fact, that, really, it's too special, and so we will completely ignore it when discussing database normalization. I discuss this oddity in more detail in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-the-serial-id-column">Ignoring the serial <code>id</code> column</h3>
<p>The reason we ignore the serial <code>id</code> column is because what we are really looking for is the <em>naturally</em> special columns. We are looking for the fundamental attributes, or properties, of the entities in question. We want to normalize the "real" data, the data you <em>need</em> in order to appropriately describe the entities. The serial <code>id</code> column isn't "real" data, it's not a property of the entity, it's just tacked on to a row to guarantee unique identification. Only by normalizing against the "real" data will you actually gain the benefits of normalization, which are, among other things, less duplication and less redundancy.</p>
<p>So, while I will include the <code>id</code> column in examples, because that's the most practical way to interact with tables, please keep in mind that (1) we will be ignoring it, and (2) why we are choosing to do so (which, as a reminder, is because we are only concerned with "real" data).</p>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form, 1NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form">First Normal Form</a>, simply put, means <strong>don't put lists in table cells</strong>.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Putting a list in a cell is strongly discouraged unless you have a very good reason to do so. There are multiple datatypes that will allow you to do this, for example the <code>ARRAY</code> keyword in SQL, but just because you can doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>Before I discuss the most common way I see this violation occur, I want to briefly discuss JSON and JSONB data in table cells. JSON(B) is a valid data type, and has many justifiable use cases, including NoSQL-like data storage, but it should still be avoided unless you have a good reason to use it. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype-json.html#JSON-DOC-DESIGN">Section 8.14.2</a> of the PostgreSQL docs states the following on this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, JSON documents should each represent an atomic datum that business rules dictate cannot reasonably be further subdivided into smaller datums that could be modified independently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, probably the most common way you'll see 1NF being violated is with cells containing comma-separated values as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>books</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden,Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath,The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The solution to the problem is to create a row per book instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>The Cat in the Hat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>See Appendix A for a SQL<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> script that transforms the unnormalized example data into the 1NF data as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form, 2NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">Second Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 1NF, <strong>every basic column is determined by <em>all</em> the special columns</strong>. <sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>An example 1NF table that violates 2NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book</th>
<th>price</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>price</code> column is determined completely by the <code>book</code> column, and nothing else. But, the special columns are both <code>book</code> <em>and</em> <code>name</code>. This partial determination of <code>price</code> by just <code>book</code>, and not also <code>name</code>, is a violation of 2NF. The logic here is that if a special column has no impact on a basic column, then the basic column probably shouldn't be in the table at all.</p>
<p>The solution is separating out the book details into a second table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>title</th>
<th>price</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>East of Eden</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Grapes of Wrath</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Green Eggs and Ham</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is sufficient to satisfy 2nd Normal Form.<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>See Appendix B for a SQL script that transforms the 1NF table into 2NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form, 3NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">Third Normal Form</a>, simply put, means that, in addition to being in 2NF, <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> This might sound confusingly similar to 2NF, but the key difference is <em>direct</em> determination. 2NF still allows for <strong>in</strong>direct determination, otherwise known as transitively dependent determination.</p>
<p>An example 2NF table that is violating 3NF is as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>loan_date</th>
<th>loanee</th>
<th>loanee_dob</th>
<th>book_id</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>2021-03-03</td>
<td>Bertha</td>
<td>1902-02-02</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2021-02-02</td>
<td>Austin</td>
<td>1900-01-01</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>The problem is that <code>loanee_dob</code> is determined by <code>loanee</code>, but <code>loanee</code> is <em>not</em> one of the special columns, which are <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code>. It <em>is</em> true that, if you give me the special columns of <code>book_id</code> and <code>loan_date</code> I <em>will</em> find the <code>loanee_dob</code> unique to that row, but the "truth" of <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>dependent</em> on the <code>loanee</code>. This indicates that the <code>loanee_dob</code> is <em>indirectly (i.e., transitively) dependent</em> on the special columns <em>through</em> the <code>loanee</code> column. This is the kind of indirectness we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p>The solution is extracting the transitively dependent columns into their own table. For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>id</th>
<th>name</th>
<th>dob</th>

<p>See Appendix C for a SQL script that transforms the 2NF table into 3NF tables as shown above. It is in a format that's easy to copy and paste and experiment with yourself, which I encourage you to do.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-boyce-codd-normal-form-bcnf-35nf">A note about Boyce-Codd Normal Form, BCNF, 3.5NF</h3>
<p>There are edge cases in the technical definition of 3NF that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a> attempts to address. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form#Definition_of_third_normal_form">This</a> is the best articulation of the difference between 3NF and BCNF/3.5NF that I've read, which occurs near the end of the section.) To the best of my knowledge, the simple takeaway is essentially the same it was for 3NF, i.e., <strong>every basic column is <em>directly</em> determined by the special columns</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-normal-form-4nf">Fourth Normal Form, 4NF</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">Fourth Normal Form</a>, in a sense, <em>cannot be put simply</em>. If I had to try, I'd say that 4NF, "simply put", means that, in addition to being in 3NF, <strong>if a group of cells across one or more columns can determine a group of cells in one or more <em>other</em> columns, then the original group of cells in the original column(s) must at least be in the special columns</strong>. Since that "simple" sentence barely makes sense, I'll just include the technical version, instead of hiding it in a footnote. The technical version is: Every non-trivial, <em>multivalued</em> functional dependency is derived from a superkey, minimal or otherwise.</p>
<p>I have not found a dataset that, in my opinion, is unequivocally both in 3NF and violating 4NF, so at the moment I do not have an example nor script to transform the relation. The wikipedia pages for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">3NF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form">BCNF</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">4NF</a> are good starting points for learning more about 4NF. When I find a good example, I will include it here.</p>
<h2 id="fifth-normal-form-and-beyond">Fifth Normal Form and beyond</h2>
<p>Things get quite academic and arguably non-practical after 4NF, and maybe actually after 3NF, although it does seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form#4NF_in_practice">4NF violations do actually occur in practice</a>.</p>
<p>I will chose not to cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form">5NF</a> and other higher-order properties that can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">this table</a> (which I also linked to in the intro). It is an interesting field of research, so I encourage you to dig deeper and look into these properties yourself.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you found this guide helpful. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out! Happy coding :D</p>
<h2 id="appendices">Appendices</h2>
<h3 id="appendix-a-sql-script-converting-unnormalized-data-to-1nf">Appendix A: SQL script converting unnormalized data to 1NF</h3>
<p>This is probably not the best solution. It is a fully contained solution. You are encouraged to copy and paste and experiment with it. For example, if you saved this file as <code>example.sql</code>, you could run the following from the command line (assuming you are using PostgreSQL):</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> createdb <span>test</span></span>
<span>$</span><span> psql -d <span>test</span> -f example.sql</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar functionality can be achieved with other datatypes. For example, if your data was in a <code>text ARRAY</code> data type, you could use <code>unnest(books)</code> instead of <code>regexp_split_to_table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> users;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> users (id <span>SERIAL</span> <span>PRIMARY KEY</span>, <span>name</span> <span>text</span>, books <span>text</span>);
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> users (<span>name</span>, books) <span>VALUES</span>
  (<span>'Austin'</span>, <span>'East of Eden,Green Eggs and Ham'</span>),
  (<span>'Bertha'</span>, <span>'Grapes of Wrath,The Cat in the Hat'</span>);

The following brief post is once again offered largely for the sake of interest, being concerned with the furthest limits of the distribution of early Byzantine material in Eurasia and Africa. What follows consists of a distribution map of fifth- to seventh-century AD Byzantine finds and contemporary imitations accompanied by a brief discussion and illustration of some of the items that have been found in the far west, far east, far north and far south of the 'Old World'. Needless to say, the extensive distribution of early Byzantine material shown here is of interest for a number of reasons from the perspective of this blog, not least the light that it sheds on early medieval Britain's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">Byzantine</a> and <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/05/anglo-saxon-finds-france-africa.html">Indian Ocean</a>&nbsp;imports and connections discussed in previous posts.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far West (1)</b></p><p>

For both <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>, writing near Bethlehem in 396, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ZUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+island+of+Britain+lies+virtually+at+the+end+of+the+world%22">Gildas</a>, writing around a century later in late fifth- or early sixth-century Britain, the British Isles lay 'virtually at the end of the world towards the west and north-west'. Despite this, there was clearly an intriguing degree of contact between the British Isles and the early Byzantine empire during the fifth to seventh centuries, as has been discussed at length in a <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">previous post</a>. In terms of the material evidence for this connection, this is manifested by significant finds of fifth- to sixth-century Eastern Mediterranean and North African <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">pottery</a> in western Britain and <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/3263">Ireland</a> (with around half of the total coming from the probable royal site of <a href="http://www.medievalhistories.com/luxury-tintagel-early-medieval-period/">Tintagel</a>, Cornwall), alongside Byzantine <a href="https://www.academia.edu/11482638/_Early_Byzantine_copper_coins_found_in_Britain_A_review_of_new_finds_recorded_with_the_Portable_Antiquities_Scheme_Ancient_History_Numismatics_and_Epigraphy_in_the_Mediterranean_World_ed._Og%C5%ADz_Tekin_Yayinlari_Istanbul_2009_263-274">coins</a>, metalwork, and a number of burials of people whose <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/10/oxygen-isotope-evidence.html">isotope results</a> indicate that they could well have grown up in Byzantine North Africa. It has <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIMmDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">often</a> been <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">suggested</a> that the material in the west may have arrived via a different mechanism to that in the east, perhaps representing direct, official contact via the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic coast vs indirect transfer via merchants and elite exchange along the rivers of mainland Europe, although finds of late sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine coins from the Anglo-Saxon royal site of Rendlesham, Suffolk, have recently been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocial-and-economic-complexity-in-early-medieval-england-a-central-place-complex-of-the-east-anglian-kingdom-at-rendlesham-suffolkdiv/FE9E1DB3180F1390E97D97BF28B637D5">interpreted</a> as evidence for 'direct mercantile contacts' with the Byzantine world in eastern Britain too.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far East (2, 3, 4)</b></p><p>

If there is a substantial amount of early Byzantine material found in Britain and Ireland, the apparent westernmost extremity of the known world in late antiquity, there is also a notable quantity at the far eastern end too. In <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>'s letter, cited above, the rhetorical opposite extremity of the world to Britain was given as India, but Roman and Byzantine authors were certainly aware of the existence of China and parts of Southeast Asia. China was, for example, mentioned by <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp261_Roman_Chinese.pdf">Roman</a> and <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">early Byzantine</a> writers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Roman_geography">first century BC onwards</a> and it is included not only in Ptolemy's second-century AD <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg">Geography</a></i> (which mentions parts of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg">Southeast Asia</a> too), but also on the <i><a href="http://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/11_india/india_8_2.html">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></i>, a fascinating map that seems to have had its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana">Late Roman period</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roman</a> and especially <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Chinese sources</a> make several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Possible_Roman_Greeks_in_Burma_and_China">references</a> to Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine entertainers, merchants and/or embassies being present in China and Southeast Asia, including a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">mission in 166 AD</a> that arrived via the south coast—probably entering China via Vietnam and claiming to have been sent by the Roman emperor <i>Andun</i> (Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus?), although this was perhaps really a commercial action that chose to represent itself this way—and numerous seventh- and eighth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Fulin:_Eastern_Roman_embassies">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://byzantineperspectives.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/what-does-tang-china-have-in-common-with-anglo-saxon-england/">embassies</a>&nbsp;to Tang China.</p><p>

In terms of the early Byzantine material found in eastern parts of Eurasia, there is a variety of surviving artefacts ranging from glass vessels, metalwork and textiles through to gold and bronze coinage, with the latter being by far the most numerous category. The most easterly early Byzantine artefacts are actually found in Korea and Japan ('2' on the map, above). The former has seen finds of <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/glass-vessels/cwFZdR3ccuXZ-w?hl=en">glass vessels</a> from the late fifth- to early sixth-century AD royal tombs at <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm">Silla, Korea</a>, some of which appear to have actually been <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpanKmU_ckYC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">made in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-19-1-1.pdf">the early Byzantine empire</a> and others of which are believed to be <a href="http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Silk_Roads/The_Eastern_Silk_Roads_Story_2015_Conference_Proceedings_UNESCO_re.pdf">imitative</a> of Late Roman/Early Byzantine forms, whilst in Japan there have been not only finds of early Byzantine 'Levantine 1' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284359734_Archaeometrical_investigation_of_natron_glass_excavated_in_Japan">glass beads</a> (probably made on the coast of present-day northern Israel) from fifth-century AD tombs, but the important mid-eighth-century AD imperial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Di">Shōsōin Repository</a> at Nara, Japan, is also reported to contain a number of Byzantine items including a <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp206_sasanian_persia.pdf">cushion cover</a> made in early Byzantine Syria. Interestingly, neither Japan nor Korea is mentioned in Roman or Byzantine sources, although a recent isotopic and mitochondrial DNA <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236210479_Stable_isotope_and_mtDNA_evidence_for_geographic_origins_at_the_site_of_Vagnari_South_Italy">study of burials</a> on the Imperial estate at Vagnari, southern Italy, has indicated that one of the adults buried there in the first or second century AD could have had Japanese ancestry, given that 'all modern mtDNA matches to her available haplotype sequence are from Japan'.<sup><a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html#fn2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

In addition to this material from the very far east, we also have a notable quantity of primarily sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">gold coins</a> and sixth- to eighth-century imitations from <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">tombs in China</a>, along with a number of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C9A7DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=RA1-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">finds</a> of early Byzantine metalwork and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-06_M-L._Chen,_The_Importation_of_Byzantine_and_Sasanian_Glass_into_China_during_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries.pdf">glassware</a> (and imitations of the same) from this country too. Both this material and that discussed in the preceding paragraph is <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">often thought</a> <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">to have arrived</a> via Central Asia along the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>', especially given the presence of a number of <a href="https://www.academia.edu/27959139/Sogdiana_its_Christians_and_Byzantium_a_Study_of_Artistic_and_Cultural_Connections_in_Late_Antiquity_and_Early_Middle_Ages">similar finds</a> in areas such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, although some of the Byzantine items found close to the Chinese coast and in Korea and Japan could have alternatively arrived by the less-discussed southern, maritime 'branch' of the Silk Road instead. Certainly, earlier <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Roman</a> and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Greek</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12682533/The_Power_of_Images_Coin_Portraits_of_Roman_Emperors_on_Jewellery_Pendants_in_Early_Southeast_Asia">mariners</a>&nbsp;made use of this route, and early Byzantine <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">written sources</a> moreover appear to make reference to it, whilst finds of fifth- to seventh-century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinrgreen/status/832976763626078211">glassware</a>&nbsp;in Japan are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/28504387/Priestman_2016_The_Silk_Road_or_the_Sea_Sasanian_and_Islamic_Exports_to_Japan">argued</a> to have probably arrived there via the sea route. With regard to this maritime 'road', another relevant find may well be that of a probably sixth-century Byzantine <a href="http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_096_0b_Borrell_EarlyByzantineLampFromPongTuk.pdf">lamp</a> found in Thailand (marked as '3' on the map, above), and it is worth noting in this context that an East Javanese <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LhaWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><i>millefiori</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebeadsite.com/abm-rio3.html">bead</a> of sixth-century date has been found at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica">Berenike</a> too (curiously, such beads are <a href="http://www.aihv.org/en/pdf/16-77.pdf">very rare indeed</a> outside of East Java, with the only other concentration really being in the Silla tombs of Korea, mentioned above!).</p><p>

The United States and the Soviet Union have narrowly avoided full-scale nuclear destruction and resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War looms on the horizon, and Mao Zedong’s China—fresh off a split with the Soviets—has just successfully blown up its first atomic bomb in a dry lakebed in southeastern Xinjiang, near what is now the <a href="https://www.wildcamels.com/what-we-do/lop-nur-nature-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest reserve for Bactrian camels</a>. </p><p>China’s nuclear test announced the country as the world’s fifth nuclear-armed nation, though unlike France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese nuclear program was a black box for American intelligence. <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb488/docs/Doc%2028%2011-2-64%20inr%20on%20chinese%20test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recently declassified government files show</a>, for example, that the U.S. was shocked to learn that the bomb was fueled by uranium, not plutonium. Military-industrial honchos were left scratching their heads as to how to gather intelligence, until a chance meeting between General Curtis LeMay and mountaineer Barry Bishop at a Washington D.C. cocktail party led to one of the most quixotic, unsuccessful operations in the CIA’s long history of screwups.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="792" height="612" src="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg 792w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=62,48 62w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"><figcaption><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb488/docs/doc%2033%201-0-65%20circa%20AFtAC%20report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Air Force analysis</a> of nuclear debris scatter, which confirmed the use of enriched uranium.

Everest the year prior, and according to <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Takeda’s fascinating 2007 <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>, he gushed about the unobstructed views he enjoyed from the world’s (<a href="https://defector.com/a-geologist-rocks-my-world-on-why-earths-tallest-mountain-isnt-so-obvious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably</a>) tallest mountain. Takeda writes that LeMay put the pieces together and, “From this casual exchange emerged an unlikely inspiration: Recruit America’s best high-altitude climbers to place a nuclear powered observation device atop the world’s greatest mountain range.” The hope was that a transceiver could pick up radio communications between Chinese nuclear personnel, remaining functional for years off of the heat from decaying plutonium isotopes. Per Takeda, the CIA’s device was an “oven-sized metal bin with five radiating fins” that weighed 125 pounds and was topped by a six-foot long antenna. If this sounds like a crude product of ’60s nuclear frenzy, consider that <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s Perseverance rover</a> is scooting around on Mars thanks to this exact sort of battery. </p><p>Bishop could no longer climb high alpine peaks after <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/first-successful-us-everest-summit-took-a-toll-on-barry-bishops-boots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing all of his toes in the Everest expedition</a>, but by 1965, the CIA started putting together a team, picked a name (Operation Hat), and chose a mountain. Everest straddled China’s border, so it was out of contention. CIA officials eventually chose Nanda Devi, the tallest peak entirely within India’s borders. Nanda Devi offered two advantages to the Americans: long sightlines into Western China and the help of an Indian state that the U.S. had just supported in its 1962 border skirmish with China. </p><p>At this point in history, Nanda Devi had only been summited by six people, with three others dying in the process, so the CIA recruited a dream team of famous American climbers. The corps included pioneering El Capitan big-waller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/obituaries/tom-frost-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Frost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/us/luther-jerstad-61-alpinist-who-scaled-everest-in-1963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 Everest</a> veteran Lute Jerstad, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> cover darling <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/jim-mccarthy-was-first-climber-on-sports-illustrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim McCarthy</a>, and the unsung alpinist <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(16)31088-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Schaller</a>. They <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a training course</a> on nuclear technology and “the Asian mentality” at a South Carolina military base, though the climbers say they mostly spent time “playing volleyball and doing some serious drinking.” <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full team undertook a training mission on Mount McKinley</a> in June with their Indian counterparts, and even though “distressing weather and other difficulties kept them from the summit,” the CIA “chose to ignore” the omens and the American-Indian team set out for Nanda Devi in October 1965. </p><p>The CIA has not yet declassified files from the expedition, including apparently extensive photographs and journal records made by Schaller, so we do not have a detailed account of what happened on the mountain. But we do know how the mission ended: catastrophic failure. A storm pinned several climbers and the device down while they were roughly 1,800 feet from the summit. Indian intelligence lead Capt. M.S. Kohli was forced to call a retreat, and the team stashed the device in a crevice and attempted to anchor it in place, so it would stay put until they could come and retrieve it on the other side of winter.</p><p>McCarthy spoke at length with Takeda <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>—which really is great, Takeda makes his own attempt on Nanda Devi and narrowly escapes death by avalanche—and he recalled his fury at the expedition’s failure:</p><blockquote><p>When I realize that they’re dumping the fucking generator and going down the mountain, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing? Have them bring it down! Are you crazy?’ I’m yelling at the top of my lungs.” According to McCarthy, the CIA case officer nearly had to pull him off Kohli. “He says to me,” McCarthy says, ‘You are creating an international incident!’”</p><p>“But,” McCarthy adds, “I had a vision of absolute clarity. We’re going to lose a SNAP generator, powered by plutonium, in the headwaters of the Ganges!”</p><cite><a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock And Ice</a></cite></blockquote><p>That might be what wound up happening. Nobody knows where the device ended up, since it disappeared from Nanda Devi at some point in the winter. The CIA ran a total of eight field operations in the region between 1965 and 1968, aimed at both finding the first device and getting another one up and running. Though they eventually implanted a plutonium device on nearby Nanda Kot, they have never been able to find their lost transceiver. The successfully placed device was also quickly buried under the snow and stopped working months later, after producing no useful intelligence.</p><p>The grim failure of Operation Hat resurfaced this month after violent floods killed over 50 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The floods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/asia/india-glacier-flood-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likely began</a> when a chunk of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and trapped flowing water, forming a lake that eventually burst through and swept through nearby valleys. The undeniable oddness of a glacial breaking apart during the winter has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56102459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led some locals to speculate</a> that perhaps the plutonium generator, which is still likely producing heat, led to the deadly floods.</p><p>There’s no evidence for the hypothesis, though even after years of reconnaissance missions and rigorous chemical assays of the surrounding area, nobody knows where the CIA’s lost nuclear-powered spy oven is. </p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>

      <p>When you insert data into a database and run COMMIT you expect things to be there: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">Atomically, Consistent, Isolated and Durable</a>, like Codd commanded us 40 years ago, but also quickly. There is a surprising amount of sophistication being poured into this, but since I do not want to shame MongoDB and Redis developers in this post, I am not going to talk about that much in this place.</p>

<p>We are instead trying to understand what our databases are doing all day, from the point of view of the storage stack.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/linux_observability_tools.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>That Brendan Gregg Graphics</em></p>

<p>Here is your performance tooling (sans EBPF) as shown by Brendan Gregg in various iterations. We are interested into the various blues in this graphic, VFS and downwards. The most detailed information of what goes on in the blue stack is given by blktrace. It’s an I/O request recorder.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, blktrace tooling sucks big time. You have the choice between blkparse, iowatcher and seekwatcher, and they either give you unappealing and hard to read ASCII dumps, or are hard to use and abandoned to boot. A colleague threw <a href="https://www.oakgatetech.com/applications/analytics">Workload Analytics</a> around. And with that you can actually see what goes on.</p>

<p>So, let’s have a look.</p>



<p>When you go to our Grafana, and ask nicely, you can basically divide our databases into three load classes: “200 commit/s”, “2000 commit/s”, and “20.000 commit/s”, so “low write load”, “busy write load” and “should be thinking about what they are doing really soon” write load.</p>

<p>I am using representatives from every workload class to point out a few things.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-reads">But what about Reads?</h2>

<p>Amazingly, at work we do not really care much about disk reads from databases.</p>

<p>We build our databases, especially customer facing databases, in a way that we try to hold the working set of the database in memory.</p>

<p>The “working set” of anything is the set of things that you will be needing in the near future. Unfortunately, predicting the future is hard, so what we define as the working set instead is “the set of things that we have most recently used and are therefore hoping to use in the near future again”, which works reasonably well until there is a change in workload pattern.</p>

<p>In our databases, the “anything” that matters is a 16 KB database page as it resides in the InnoDB Buffer Pool. So what we do is simple: We spend money on memory, warm up the InnoDB Buffer Pool and then serve data from memory.
We can prove that works: InnoDB can do point reads from memory at memcache speeds, which is why we don’t use much of memcache and Redis in the first place – they don’t help.</p>

<p>We can also capacity test our databases, and we will find that as we increase the load the number of disk reads does not go up. Data is served from memory, and not from disk.</p>

<p>So what we care about is disk writes. They are the same on every instance of a replication chain, because of the shared nothing architecture of replication: Each chain member must apply the same set of changes from the primary down to all leaf replicas.</p>

<h2 id="the-write-model">The Write Model</h2>

<p>On Commit, we write out 1 KB (or more) of Redo Log. The write happens with <code>O_DIRECT</code> to XFS, and there is a lot of thought that goes into these few words.</p>

<p>Because it is <code>O_DIRECT</code>, the write already writes to disk. There is no need to <code>fsync()</code> or <code>fdatasync()</code> or anything else.</p>

<p><code>O_DIRECT</code> writes also bypass the file system buffer cache, which is good, because then there is less memory pressure and less risk of paging out the database server. Usually when that happens (memory pressure forces paging on mysqld), you die a horrible and hard to debug death in latency problems and SLO violations.</p>

<p>We use XFS. XFS on the average takes twice as long as ext4 to write data to disk, but XFS always takes the same amount of time to write data – it has been specifically designed in a way that there is very low jitter. ext4, on the other hand, is known to have downspikes and large commit wait times every few seconds, and that is really, really bad when you run at 10.000 queries/s.</p>

<p>XFS also is capable of having multiple concurrent writers on a file when the file is open with O_DIRECT. Unlike all other Linux File Systems, <a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/2018/11/29/but-is-it-atomic.html">it does not lock the file’s in-memory inode globally</a> to guarantee atomic writes in this case. Such a feature is very dear to database people.</p>

<p>The Commit is what users have to wait for. When it is done, the database can do the real data write later, often much later, and in the background. So what we really care for is the actual commit latency.</p>

<p>The real write happens later, in the Checkpoint. <a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/07/27/mysql-transactions.html">What happens is complicated enough to justify a writeup of its own</a>. But, to make it short, we write data to the Doublewrite Buffer in a few very large linear writes as protection against torn pages, and then we writev() a scatter I/O of 16K pages to update in place.</p>

<p>This is different from Postgres, and enables us to avoid costly vacuum runs. We make an assumption here, and that is: Rollbacks are rare (and expensive in MySQL).</p>

<h2 id="the-test-write-model">The Test Write Model</h2>

<p>All that complexity is basically nonsense for benchmarking.</p>

<p>If you want to know if a thing can run MySQL, and how well, you simply randwrite 16KB pages in <code>O_DIRECT</code> and see what happens. That’s a gross simplification compared to above, but holds up surprisingly well as a model for predicting MySQL speed and capacity.</p>



<p>In order to see what real databases do to their disks, I went to the chosen representative for the 200-class and <code>blktrace</code>’ed it.</p>

<p>It turns out that you can’t <code>blktrace</code> a single disk database machine, because the disk writes from the <code>blktrace</code> will mess up the metrics from the database. It also turns out that <code>systemd</code> mounts a 12GB ramdisk as <code>/run/user/&lt;uid&gt;</code> that can hold a 10 minute <code>blktrace</code> with no problems.</p>

<p>When we feed that trace to Workload Intelligence, we get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-iops.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>The low red line is the 200 IOPS baseline load. Turns out, there are spikes, up and past 2000 IOPS.</em></p>

<p>The first thing we learn: Kris is right. There are no reads.</p>

<p>The second thing we learn: 200 IO Operations per Second it may be, but there are spikes, up to and past 2000 IOPS even. They are not long, but they happen often enough.</p>

<p>So how long does it take to write to disk? Well, there is no disk. There is Flash Storage, and it does not even have a disk interface any more – it sits directly on the PCI bus. A Flash drive that is directly on the PCI bus is called NVME instead of SSD (it is otherwise the same drive).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-latency.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Most of the time there is very little wait.</em></p>

<p>Flash is not fast, but NVME is: The drive not only has flash, it also has (large capacitor buffered) non-volatile memory it uses to buffer write and rearrange things in the background. It also has its own ARM processor with its own operating system.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have to wait a bit, but most of the time it’s really, really fast. How fast? We need to go deeper:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-latency-detail.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>30µs or 0.03ms is the time it takes to write to memory over the PCI bus.</em></p>

<p>When we talk to the remote NVRAM on the other side of the PCI bus, it takes 30µs, or 0.03ms. As long as we do not overwhelm the NVRAM buffers of the drive, we have a 30µs commit latency on local memory.</p>

<p>Another number, which will come in handy later, is the time to cross our entire network stack within the same data center: That’s around 6 switches and routers, and it will add another 60µs to any round trip across the network in the best of all cases. So a remote flash drive never can be faster than around 100µs or 0.1ms.</p>

<p>Where do the writes go? We can plot the Linear Block Addresses and see:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-lba.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>LBA over time. See the position of the log files, and the checkpoints.</em></p>

<p>When you plot “addresses written to over time”, you will see that there is a bunch of blocks that get written to again and again. These are the various logs and write buffers the database uses.</p>

<p>The drive internally has a flash translation layer (FTL), which makes sure that these block rewrites are actually distributed across all the positions in the flash you have. This kind of Wear Leveling makes sure the drive actually can live 7-10 years before the flash wears out.</p>

<p>The SD card or USB memory stick you are using in your local Raspi does not have that, and neither has the on board flash in the entertainment module of your Tesla. That is why they fail rapidly as actual fixed blocks of flash are being rewritten a few thousand times. Use a proper drive with a proper FTL and that does not happen.</p>

<p>In the graphics above you can also see the checkpoints scatter writes happen, and you can see how they are spaced apart widely, many tens of thousands of transactions. Checkpointing allows the database to aggregate changes in in-memory pages (and the log, for persistence). All that complexity is actually saving you disk writes!</p>

<p>Flash does not have a single write head as disk drives do. They are not forced to do things sequentially, but in fact all the various chips in your drive can do things concurrently. Deep disk write queues are necessary to keep all these channels fed for NVME, while they are poison of SSD and HDD.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-qdepth.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Queue Depth over time</em></p>

<p>A low concurrency hierarchy such as this one is not even touching the true write potential of a single NVME: A single drive can do 20.000 disk writes per second, sequentially in a single thread, if you are pushing really hard, but it can do 800.000 disk writes per second if you are feeding it with sufficient concurrency.</p>

<p>These are two other important numbers to keep in mind. They are the reason why “IOPS Quotas” should be a thing of the past – it is impossible for any reasonable workload to actually exhaust a single NVME drive, and distributed storages usually have hundreds of them.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at the latency diagram from above, again, and check the distribution of completion times in a Latency Histogram. It tells us how prevalent slow writes are over the observation window:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.koehntopp.info/uploads/2021/02/class-200-latency-histo.png" alt=""></p>

<p><em>It’s called Flash for a reason.</em></p>

<p>So even with these curtains in the latency over time diagram, we can see that 90% of all writes happen in the 30µs window, and there are …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
<p>A fully weaponized exploit for the Spectre CPU vulnerability was uploaded on the malware-scanning website VirusTotal last month, marking the first time a working exploit capable of doing actual damage has entered the public domain.</p>



<p>The exploit was discovered by French security researcher Julien Voisin. It targets Spectre, a major vulnerability that was disclosed in January 2018.</p>



<p>According to its website, the <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> bug is a hardware design flaw in the architectures of Intel, AMD, and ARM processors that allows code running inside bad apps to break the isolation between different applications at the CPU level and then steal sensitive data from other apps running on the same system.</p>



<p>The vulnerability, which <a href="https://pwnies.com/archive/2018/winners/">won a Pwnie Award in 2018</a> for one of the best security bug discoveries of the year, was considered a milestone moment in the evolution and history of the modern CPU.</p>



<p>Its discovery, along with the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown</a> bug, effectively forced CPU vendors to rethink their approach to designing processors, making it clear that they cannot focus on performance alone, to the detriment of data security.</p>



<p>Software patches were released at the time, but the Meltdown and Spectre disclosures forced Intel to rethink its entire approach to CPU designs going forward.</p>



<h2><strong>Initial Spectre PoCs were all benign</strong></h2>



<p>At the time, the teams behind the Meltdown and Spectre bugs published their work in the form of research papers and some trivial proof-of-concept code to prove their attacks.</p>



<p>Shortly after the Meltdown and Spectre publications, experts at <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/100383867141221115206/6517535568830348546">AV-TEST</a>, <a href="https://blog.fortinet.com/2018/01/30/the-exponential-growth-of-detected-malware-targeted-at-meltdown-and-spectre">Fortinet</a>, and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/we-may-soon-see-malware-leveraging-the-meltdown-and-spectre-vulnerabilities/">Minerva Labs</a> spotted a spike in VirusTotal uploads for both CPU bugs.</p>



<p>While initially there was a fear that malware authors might be experimenting with the two bugs as a way to steal data from targeted systems, the exploits were classified as harmless variations of the public PoC code published by the Meltdown and Spectre researchers and <a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2018/02/there-no-evidence-wild-malware-using-meltdown-or-spectre/">no evidence was found of in-the-wild attacks</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meltdown and Spectre always seemed vulnerabilities where for most people and orgs the cure was going to be worse than the disease. <a href="https://t.co/aPOvGD2GSF">https://t.co/aPOvGD2GSF</a></p>— Martijn Grooten (@martijn_grooten) <a href="https://twitter.com/martijn_grooten/status/979076447456432128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But today, <a href="https://dustri.org/b/spectre-exploits-in-the-wild.html">Voisin said</a> he discovered new Spectre exploits—one for <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ecc0f2aa29b102bf8d67b7d7173e8698c0341ddfdf9757be17595460fbf1791a/details">Windows</a> and one for <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6461d0988c835e91eb534757a9fa3ab35afe010bec7d5406d4dfb30ea767a62c/details">Linux</a>—different from the ones before. In particular, Voisin said he found a Linux Spectre exploit capable of dumping the contents of <strong><em>/etc/shadow</em></strong>, a Linux file that stores details on OS user accounts.</p>



<p>Such behavior is clearly malicious; however, there is no evidence that the exploit was used in the wild, as it could have also been uploaded on VirusTotal by a penetration tester as well.</p>



<h2><strong>Exploits linked to Immunity’s CANVAS tool</strong></h2>



<p>But the most interesting part of Voisin’s discovery is in the last paragraph of his blog, where he hints that he may have discovered who may be behind this new Spectre exploit.</p>



<p>“Attribution is trivial and left as an exercise to the reader,” the French security researcher said in a mysterious ending.</p>



<p>But while Voisin did not want to name the exploit author, several people were not as shy. Security experts on both Twitter and news aggregation service HackerNews were quick to spot that the new Spectre exploit might be a module for CANVAS, a penetration testing tool developed by Immunity Inc.</p>



<p>“If you are a paid subscriber, you get extra bits [of information] from VirusTotal. One of which is you can see what files are ‘parents’ of the sample,” <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302565">said a HackerNews user today</a>.</p>



<p>“In this case, there are a bunch of zip files that contain this file, all named Immunity Canvas or similar. Canvas is a pentesting tool where they publish exploits, so I guess he’s saying you can attribute it to Immunity.”</p>



<p>An Immunity spokesperson did not return a request for comment from <em>The Record</em> before this article’s publication to confirm that the Spectre exploits uploaded on VirusTotal last month are indeed Canvas modules.</p>



<p>However, in a tweet today from Dave Aitel, the former Immunity CEO appears to confirm that Voisin’s discovery is indeed the CANVAS Spectre module that his former company was touting back in February 2018.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Furthermore, shortly after this this article went live, a source in the cybersecurity community who did not want to be named effectively confirmed our report by pointing <em>The Record</em> to a post on an underground hacking forum where a threat actor had published a cracked version of the Immunity CANVAS v7.26 pen-testing tool, along with cracked copies of White Phosphorus and D2, two CANVAS expansion packs that contained two different sets of exploits for various vulnerabilities. Among the vulnerabilities there was also an exploit for CVE- 2017-5715, the vulnerability ID for the Spectre bug.</p>

<p>Dmitry Smilyanets, cyber threat intelligence expert for Recorded Future, told <em>The Record</em> that cracked versions of this pen-testing toolkit have been shared in private Telegram channels for months, since at least October 2020, if not earlier.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="810" height="448" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/telegram-leak.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/telegram-leak.png 810w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/telegram-leak-300x166.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/telegram-leak-768x425.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"></figure>



<p>These new revelations suggest that these cracked CANVAS versions are most likely the source of the CANVAS Spectre modules that were uploaded on VirusTotal on February 3.</p>



<p>The fact that Immunity had a fully working and fully weaponized Spectre exploit is not a surprise for industry experts, as Aitel’s company was also among the first to put together a fully weaponized exploit for the BlueKeep vulnerability <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-company-selling-weaponized-bluekeep-exploit/">back in 2019</a>, which it publicly advertised at the time, as a way to boast CANVAS’ superior penetration-testing features.</p>



<h2><strong>Last “patch now” warning!</strong></h2>



<p>Copies of this Spectre exploit are now making the rounds in Discord and Telegram channels run by security researchers, and it’s only a matter of time until they hit GitHub and become broadly available to everyone, including malware authors.</p>



<p>If the exploit code can be weaponized as part of an actual attack still remains to be seen as this is no run-of-the-mill vulnerability, but ready-made exploits that enter the public domain are often abused as it’s easier for threat actors to adapt code written by someone else than write their own from scratch.</p>



<p>Voisin’s discovery is about as close the Spectre doomsday clock can tick close to midnight before attacks get underway, if they haven’t already.</p>

The Cognitive in CBT refers to mental activity, such as thoughts, beliefs, memories, images or values. The behavioral part includes all the things we do on a daily basis. This can be things you do with others or things you do alone.</p><p>CBT saw it's beginning when the American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck (and others) noticed a pattern of thinking that was common for many clients with depression. Not very impressed with the result of traditional therapies, they wanted to address these issues with a more straightforward and direct approach. And so Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was born.</p><h3 id="cognitions-thoughts">Cognitions (thoughts)</h3><p>A core principle in CBT is that our emotional reactions and behaviors are influenced by how we think about ourselves, others, and the world around us. Humans have a great capacity for thinking, but that requires time and energy. Most of the time, we take mental shortcuts and react to events that happen without giving them much thought. These shortcuts, or cognitive biases, often lead us to interpret and process information inaccurately.</p><p>If you ask two people to give a presentation on something they are both knowledgeable about, you might get two different reactions. One is hesitant and suggests someone else. The other immediately and enthusiastically agrees. It's the exact same situation. So why do they react so differently?</p><p>CBT explains that this difference in emotional reactions and behaviors comes from different ways of thinking about the situation. One thinks he might start to shake and others will notice. The other one thinks that this is a good opportunity to share his knowledge.</p><p>The common-sense model</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_situation_emotion.a05844e.25c1b7895053af109d8796a6365f759f.svg" width="473" alt="Situation leads to emotion" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 473 69' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-577ab4bd82e2546c7e456c9eec27b8a9'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-577ab4bd82e2546c7e456c9eec27b8a9)' width='473' height='69' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAJCAYAAACCPip6AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADrUlEQVRIx51WWU9TURAu0N9AfDfxH/jqIzRB04VuLAXS3haRCqjgwloIlC0uLBElASWAILQUFFliotE3FJXYlhbQaASffNH4QFjaceb03tvLbSHgTSbfmTnbzHfmzLkKLuhZK16fBi7ojWA7al/1YtsDAkrbyfrkdkH4tfZLvr%2bg9iUFfohphBkZGUz4dioJtTMzM2lMKj/2LPmGa/gRA4jHEhorjD9sHtr9iGHENwoKHpXEwAOT8SADngMBH2pLJGmvdHOBsJOCKno9oMQg0wTBwJUK/kNdiXqKY32akcStevLKf70Ce2gKijdmDgr6nGA7Tp9MLn59Dgo7njx/akRClDkfngLHlxmG9jUfODam46eLDpE4cAF7KK6zsYiS4Gk9JGCedDcFBQAK%2bYeBV2DgZwTdujTCSME5BprLrXp37EEP%2bUgZyhD3juB%2bvPiYDfdmOusL8TpvI%2bRkazAMevYVQtpLg7e%2bHwVDbx3kP%2buB/JlusMz3AefHjPg8AbaPY2BdfsL6Chb6WNu28hRsH8ZYn4QEkQDU2yioLIspHQMuJMGgCXMR/6DsoLhQThVvzqXxV8Do3FqkdXY5wTcknHww9NZDvq8LbJ/Gwbo0zLI15tcoWGZ7wTJ3/yi/kFTxqkcVsnsLmIJQ9PYRaOovg6G7FrRNFaCpdYKpvxGMD1yga6sETU0paBvKQH/nFujc1yC7vQq0jeWQ3XGdXQ15BnD%2biQ4KSqU%2bf06j0QCJWq1miCREVCoVaLVaQAKWswrN6YyAwKRJIEC8VmEfWN%2bNwIUrHOSOd%2bKeMd%2bYD7i3ruUqaF3loL99U7RpXWXMPww6aa1KIEDIAFpEf68azENuMA%2b2sDbZsjtvMGLMg81getgIhp46MHTVQM5wGxPbynjspKQECBlQwDIgDwPN49GI%2bBtxG6UWJb0KNlPlGSD6hqdI6%2btaK8E00Azmx27IGW3Hw2kC/d1q0UYHZeipZX6ST%2bahVpYNvF8HCeAdjfJpERV1RMyGKNaAKG4cE2qHeQx543pY0idZgxHwI14Dkn1IgBMDPy3omH1CDTCWbi3Q3D1OVqRZOlOmYX1i9YpqFNUj0kNTol2oYZQ5suIcvwIOGiRhJF7svMntJxDcYJ%2bCQGynoApf9tMroOQrPr0E4itALwK9AvZ1H6sBWKBMzp%2bLNHf3qKf5JJKMBMqAv/Re05MlCGNdop9UhPmI2yXfZmmzBvl/AL35kv%2bAFMl/gFAE9WIGoLP/G3QyAiQZEPkHBM14KrRQEhsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>The cognitive model</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_situation_thought_emotion.e4ad7cc.294c7369e1e2d3479ebae5203785d821.svg" width="758" alt="Situation leads to cognitions (negative thoughts) leads to emotion" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 758 69' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a0dae8d490a9960785daa502d0bd80b7'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a0dae8d490a9960785daa502d0bd80b7)' width='758' height='69' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAGCAYAAABzaJivAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAADgklEQVQ4y41UW0iUURD%2bo6wI6imI3ioiiiyKXoveXNfooXTXrU3N3F0vmARBhXZPk8zUTHMrKysqbXfdtbQbiT10ewkl73Y3lQh6EHoo8z/TN7Nnt82nfhhm/nPmzMz5zjdjuPubyd0XUK5eP0WlZ4qOsbXvZO7HVnL1BTIMfA7vsTiLxTLD0N%2bWonyx4bsYvl8gY7BHPUMhEfz/lR7/KO%2b5%2bwOi9foI7DHoYeh4jrX1cEFcQkJCNIet/MBM1vBJgoxr35i4Pi3%2bGNFrvZITOfxfjcjlUQAJGANB8rwNEQolz7sWcg8Gw/b7u7IOX4Uzk3mf77O924j5AMIiFLk28u/q9q3K/XCPPBwTcXa9uEa7Xt2g7LctlI14IrzPeXsDDC7W/vpnI6%2br%2b86G2ByIvzAWCNSws%2bBbuzyMnOHY7%2b5SzqfWsOChOAcL27zmGQxJfM5jyOWHgiqjo55sZ4vIcbWEnL4KSn/spe1N5eS4UkzOQKVIWmsNAGoWBjAAng/33HMNY7bFmtiBotoAQJ/VaiVLYmIDapuO/eWcCP4mwDW33SpTtuoihTzKfv6ISq0/oewXjqnksn0quXy/SqkqlDXxx4UYkLzxp2vWL1i6BDnqEb8EeTohA4mbNzk0AGn5I4%2bYob/wQCr9kVelXi5WaW21CvWq9Id1ivPuCJ5VaQ/qZA0sUPrhlSHJBoPmzmcNJooyHddKTRRl2moPmymVhSYAMe3eo7K3/fZpuQjOTOR9agMjWjyoYZolyXoKRRWhwBD0MIotkBYYCq2QV2TWALhMvD4KEiBREDmbq8hWc4iQjzKeXKQdoWqRyOWZGfk/n6/euDg%2bHjHbEf8mx4f8sGxK2hMFYFQAmBAAEB%2b1Uuql42SrPki2cwfJXndEND%2bw/cJRyupsZMYL843soZYwbSLUYbpoerKdA0rmROjDe9wOoE7%2b2GO%2b2J4pLTAHxc2L0rPHF89xBeSBoMp8eZ0cDSfBpiqtK8lxvRRMO0NOf6UAwhcHyPI63JJoo6ktsBIyP6YFMnQtE3IWreR6c0daGaBH4mkdkJbWs0yANtwYUjA%2b8xD5H4Ev64%2bQ77CFhikle2fi8nHRIbg/V2wMyWV6ZoSHZ7ePsrqa5AUynzeIzcXKWlcjZb2%2bxReOMoBbDXqdzvHPELRXFM7SOWx5w/f5zO9orv5AdHhLnHB%2b0jEjWnkA0B88OW688/hLQQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>CBT proposes that it’s not the <strong>situation</strong> that makes us feel something, but the <strong>thoughts</strong> about that situation.</p><h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3><p>Changing what you do is often the most powerful way of changing how you think and feel about something. The behavioral part in CBT is about testing new behaviors and learning what happens when you gain new experiences.</p><p>If you always avoid giving presentations, you will never experience a successful one. Your negative thoughts about yourself in that situation will never change. A common unhelpful belief that people have when speaking to a crowd is that they will get anxious, start to shake, and the audience will see that as a sign of weakness.</p><p>To target the cognition that shaking is a sign of weakness, CBT uses something called a behavioral experiment. In these kinds of experiments, the goal is to get real experiences about what happens if you shake and if it's true that other people will react negatively to this. A typical behavioral experiment might be to videotape yourself talking in front of a crowd. When viewing the video afterward, try to notice the level of shaking and what reaction the group had to this. Most likely, you will see that your shaking was barely noticeable, and those who were listening didn't react at all.</p><h3 id="the-cbt-triangle-putting-it-all-together">The CBT triangle (putting it all together)</h3><p>Therapy involves changing how you feel about something. Whether it is to achieve a goal or to stop being anxious or sad — it's all about changing emotions. Now, this is hard to do directly. We have little control over our emotions; they will pop up whether you like it or not. CBT aims to change how you feel about something through our thoughts (cognitions) and behaviors.</p><p><img src="https://www.sleepedy.com/assets/static/model_thought_emotion_behavior.485f804.33e4fd7021857337e42b912f76ac6948.svg" width="393" alt="The CBT triangle" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 393 174' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-56af8b61d402fee5a6a492789169c2bc'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-56af8b61d402fee5a6a492789169c2bc)' width='393' height='174' xlink:href='data:image/svg%2bxml%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAcCAYAAADRJblSAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAIKUlEQVRYw9VXaWxU1xWexUZq0lZK%2b6uVmkhVW1WRWirxI1IrUTnCS0BgG2NsbIIxxjMmIgkRBBG2GBfbwcHYmYK8ZOI1tgOeGS9Ak0CqKjUJFdgGL%2bPdcZriJlEbVXEVRQ2ed/qdM/eOn4dxColN6Eif7rn3vnuW755z3huL5Wv%2bent7LdeuXbMpee/o6ChhPgvZwEiLAaVrlnVDPsC22Cbb/sZ/YQS4JyYm2MmbynEJoKenR8DzcCy0rs%2baxptKd8M9RQAc4cBtSq4YHx9nh2/qDOAABgYGBNevX6e%2bvj4JSMt6naHXTTdvzoCbSrdbkW1j2/daBlSyk%2bYM4AB9Ph%2b1tLRQd3c3Xb58WYK6evUqXbp0iTo7O6mrq0v2GFeuXAnJ4RmgdL9yz2WAJgBjpc4AdpqDGBkZoYKCAnK5XFReXk75%2bfl0/PhxKi0tpaNHj8peWVkZlZSUUHFxsawXFhZSY2MjDQ4OhkrElAGv3FMZ8GUEsPN%2bv5/cbjdVVFRIUPX19VRdXS1kNDQ0iKzn/Fxzc7PItbW1/x8EhJWA7gFfAFy3Btcv6tpANhioeQHKQvb6%2b/tvGXmfn%2bdR1b7GF2NjY0yG%2bxstgfj4eEtcXJzIPDqdTgtuWWeAe3Jykp2cDX%2bVmZvbV3wVzrJuyPIWaGpqstfU1IR8uis/Dlgbg2zV6xcuXLCrDMgfGhpiJz9XWSDA%2bleCWQfrZN1YL9J2161bZzNfxpISwQZMxuTGY2NjrZC/ayqHbwG/grOM5WpcDLCu5awb5XMf21qzZs0DPCYkJMzLyLuRBVY1fgdoB1bwPDs723aXqtCm7JcCz7CckpKy9MGrDNDB/xAYRcoRxu/xmtVqtaBzW3FD3J0XHVNTU7a6ujq7yZ8DSUlJbP%2bQ6gNWc5YueuNTzU8T8BDwH%2bA88ANgF/ajlzINTbZ/AyQBv0b6MwF1ykf7kjdEbQRGjwEeJbuAt8y3sEQE2JSNFZD/qS7hx8B7LIc35qV49ekb%2bCXwMfAzYDmXgskB2xKXob6AYsBruoDXNQFLkgFhBPwUWMnND52YU/CcesZm/kZY7B9eeSGC%2bRJWr17Ntt/ktxCQyuurVq268xLY7vcIcoe8oTES9tLHlqQ9TquJlB2JiYkUFx//HM9TS/Za0yrzQ8%2bbdTK0rdvxJ5Jf2wdaLet2Bt80cQkJD8L%2bAPD5YymJ0ntSjuyy5vQ0WxwTHQvGENI1BL3%2boGxxTHnviLAfoeGLE6tidwNbbpfk2yZgyDNvXOi38qGHl8XFxrpiYx59%2bGunFxyLBjtRGKN4XAi875jsjMq6WBW9/uCT9/PZza1ly7Z1N0XljrbNO48AonIxx2iNFLz544XLy1w6IRIGPVboima9gkFPlPNvf7BnvHpsGRHJM8n7d357N03ZcnpaQvb18xFj8rNvPHqidfBduUOef2z3e29A/jse%2blKoZ6Zzh/H8YOtH%2bkz4WcynMfL%2bKPBzsdV3RvcRDjiKoWuW3zBc43nTb2jCfgIMKx3TZjsoh2ngQxDyIdbE71sweOta6LzfcwMyYvZcsuS9d5acYx3kHA9DpLU7AZ8fa6cn3j9PMLSGg8Lt2SK9qrD2gJa3vFlpD2aBN27H1DnRIRgP6mN/d9x4nXb89bzIzgmsT3YG91me6KS8qbOU9/452c9jHROdEf3jfW4Ms3AwgBEIjjIf9glwyzIXsCxQz%2bm533RO9Hj1fNYx4iPIkt9I3SgV8CNAEfAsUAF8BLh5Xac2zsYgy0jpDPo42hbI%2bpM7kFZ9JJDZeiKQfblB7ORcey1kH1kW2PrnmkDWW9WB7L80Bra%2bXRNAtsz5PN/XWTZkQCDTSGwYSinn%2bmlygk0QQTBO6LCEHkAOMMjP6jnvyTmszUH0GQ7cGvYkz9Mq8qNVuv8WwVYCJ4GzgAF0AWt30YBNEfCoY6SNdRnsm%2bgHmdnv1tOG8v2UevIwJT//FKUce5aSC56hVNdBkde/sIeSDu6kpENPYn0XrS/eQ4n7n6CtXbUhP80xW%2bY7jcXBVglqw4nnKKVkL2V6TtDGiucpveYobW5/iTY1l1Cmr5xwC5TpLaMMzLP%2b%2bHIkEgw0GiEAshCwjz7RPeB%2b4DGWY2JiuCx%2boUsANyYlgDNBAvxeQ5EgBPDI9rZcrBZ/0msKaVPjC5ReX0xpLxfQhuP7aH3hbnr83CnKOFMK/8sozf07QraYCQj5GZkA3GzqSweEweQjTwsZG6vyKTn/aWGb57zPbDPrwu7YwgQg/YSAja5D0Qh2HxBYu3Ytf8j0AheBt/nbnp9JryqInpcB/mAGcBZuu9pE2e/UE0iSLJVsVBnJI1KdNne45Bkn6lsylLMVPmzrbqZQhpvitUgtMMsKKj0MKDNAhsgavAbDwfmwz9jefyY4H547Z9LFegOOIOvSA5wfnOfbfhBwAh0ohXRgJZAAfF%2ba4BsV9rke4GMCpM84xtsN3KaReuqwjBktLxrptYUC3LCRXldkpJ48ZKAUjE2vHhMgI7BfFJrn9J3W2aRjDVi4G3KjYrbngDnX/Gjb/PUF5%2bHn2yRdOYC8ybPM9Gr1GrT/r09u3KRNlUBsHrq3kICb4k6edaGKMk%2bX0uMdvyc0QUl/zsCNpw6jHFyU0VQi5YBmS5vqiuSZjOYXKa3qCIEwkOlRPvsE/FZhpj8AG58BMyEMeWewftuYd3YOnwL/xv6/gEckqLF2m/oGsKu/2Czb9P%2bI4MdPq26CK4BPWAf8%2bZR9CvnVf2YGBAu2XKyawSfwDDIkuDbsnRvH1BrO5fS2yJr4OyT%2bfcax/xc%2b93eqDKvvzwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>We can draw CBT's approach as a triangle because each element is linked together.

/%3e%3c/svg%3e"></p><p>Susan has always been a good sleeper. She always falls asleep within fifteen minutes of going to bed and wakes up feeling refreshed. Susan doesn’t really think much about sleep, it’s just something that happens when she goes to bed.</p><h3 id="why-does-george-have-insomnia-and-not-susan">Why does George have insomnia and not Susan?</h3><p>What may not be obvious but separates George from Susan, is that they have very different beliefs about sleep. They experience precisely the same situation each night; they both go to bed and try to sleep. Their thoughts and feelings in this situation, are very different.</p><p>George worries that it's going to be another night of sleeplessness and that he will be dead tired at work the following day. He thinks about how a lack of sleep might damage his body and wonders if he will ever sleep well again. The minute his head hits the pillow, he's wide awake. His mind races and he starts feeling anxious and upset. He's exhausted but can't seem to fall asleep. After spending quite a bit of time unsuccessfully trying to sleep, he pulls out his phone and listens to a podcast to distract himself. He finally falls asleep a few hours before he has to get up for work.</p><p>Susan goes to bed and doesn't think much about it at all. She is fast asleep fifteen minutes after she turns off the lights.</p><h3 id="thoughts-behavior-and-feelings">Thoughts, behavior, and feelings</h3><p>George’s sleep problems started when the company he was working for experienced financial trouble and had to downsize. He worried about losing his job and not being able to afford rent. George found that he became preoccupied with thoughts of worry most of the day and even more as nighttime approached and it was time to sleep. He tried, as most do when facing problems in life, to think his way out of it. After a while, George noticed that his sleep was getting worse. It frequently took a long time to fall asleep, and he often woke up multiple times every night.</p><p>Fortunately, George didn’t lose his job. The company is now doing fine, and he doesn’t worry about it anymore, but he’s still struggling with sleep.</p><p>George’s story is typical when it comes to insomnia. It's common that some initial stressful life event sets it off, but the problems persist even when the stressor has resolved. It is notable that the event that causes insomnia in the first place varies, but when insomnia has been established, people begin to behave and think the same way.</p><p>CBT does not concern itself much with what initially caused George's insomnia. Instead, it focuses on the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that maintain it. In George's case, we can see a pattern of him worrying a lot about sleep and the consequences of not getting enough. After a while, he starts to associate the bed with feelings of frustration and anxiety.</p><p>When George's thoughts constantly revolve around sleep and the consequences of him not getting enough, his mind will interpret this as a threat. The brain's threat detection system doesn't make the distinction between thinking about a threat or actually experiencing one. It does what it’s supposed to do and tells the body to get prepared for the threat.</p><p>When the brain signals the body to get ready, the body reacts immediately. It goes into a state of arousal where the main goal is to be prepared to handle anything. Arousal is, in many ways, a state that is the opposite of sleeping. Your heart beats a little faster, your breathing starts to increase in frequency. Pupils dilate, and you are more vigilant. Because the brain believes you are in danger, you go into a mild form of fight-or-flight mode where your senses are heightened, and muscles are ready to spring into action.</p><p>The most convincing and compelling way of learning that a previously held belief is false is experiencing the opposite. George has the view that he has to put in a lot of effort to get to sleep. A goal of CBT for insomnia is going to sleep without thinking or worrying too much about it. We want George to be more like Susan and experience falling asleep without effort, and as a result, learn that he can fall asleep easily without thinking too much about it. To help people get this valuable experience, CBT for insomnia uses something called sleep restriction.</p><h3 id="sleep-restriction">Sleep restriction</h3><p>When people who struggle with sleep hear about sleep restriction the first time, they immediately think it's counterintuitive. Why should you restrict your sleep when you want more of it?</p><p>To answer this question, we need to learn about sleep drive. Sleep drive is the force that makes you sleepy when you have been awake for a long time. To …</p></div></div></div>

<p>In this post, I will focus on <strong>gradients of image signals defined on grids</strong> in computer graphics and image processing. Specifically, gradients / derivatives of images, height fields, distance fields, when they are represented as discrete, uniform grids of pixels or voxels.</p>



<p>I’ll start with the very basics – what do we typically mean by gradients (as it’s not always “standardized”), what are they used for, what are the ypical methods (forward or central differences), their cons and problems, and then proceed to discuss an interesting alternative with very nice properties – <strong>diagonal gradients</strong>.</p>



<p>My post will conclude with advice on how to use them in practice in a simple useful scheme, how to extend it with a little bit of computations to a super useful concept of a <strong>structure tensor</strong> that can characterize dominating direction of any gradient field, and finish with some signal processing fun – <strong>frequency domain analysis </strong>of forward and central differences.</p>



<h2>Image gradients</h2>



<p>What are image gradients or derivatives? How do you define gradients on a grid?</p>



<p>It’s not very well defined problem on discrete signals, but the most common and useful way to think about it is inspired by signal processing and the idea of sampling:</p>



<p><strong>Assuming there was some continuous signal that got discretized, what would be the partial derivative with regards to the spatial dimension of this continuous signal at gradient evaluation points?</strong></p>



<p>This interpretation is useful both for computer graphics (where we might have discretized descriptions of continuous surfaces; like voxel fields, heightmaps, or distance fields), as well as in image processing (where we often assume that images are “natural images” that got photographed).</p>



<p>Continuous gradients and derivatives used for things like normals of procedural SDFs are also interesting, but a different story. I will not cover those here, and instead recommend you check out <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/normalsSDF/normalsSDF.htm">this cool post</a> by Inigo Quilez with lots of practical tricks (re-reading it I learned about the tetrahedron trick) and advice. I am sure that no matter your level of familiarity with the topic, you will learn something new.</p>



<p>In my post, I will focus on computer graphics, image processing, and basic signal processing takes on the problem. There are two much deeper connections that I haven’t personally worked too much with. So I leave it as something that I wish I can expand my knowledge in the future, but also encourage my readers to explore it:</p>



<p><strong>Further reading one:</strong> The first connection is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">Partial Differential Equations</a> and their discretization. Solving PDEs and solving discretized PDEs is something that many specialized scientific domains deal with, and computing gradients is an inherent part of numerical discretized PDE solutions. I don’t know too much about those, but I’m sure literature covers this in much detail.</p>



<p><strong>Further reading two:</strong> The second connection is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet">wavelets</a>, filter banks, and the frequency precision / localization trade-off. This is something used in communication theory, electrical engineering, radar systems, audio systems, and many more. While I read and am familiar with <em>some </em>theory, I haven’t found too many practical uses of wavelets (other than the simplest Gabor ones or in use for image pyramids) in my work, so again I’ll just recommend you some more specialized reading.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Applications</h2>



<p>Ok, why would we want to compute gradients? Two common uses:</p>



<p><strong>Compute surface normals </strong>– when we have something like a scalar field – whether distance field describing an underlying implicit surface, or simply a height field, we might want to compute its gradients to compute normals of the surface, or of the heightfield for normal mapping, evaluating BRDFs and lighting etc. Maybe even for physical simulation, collision, or animation on terrain!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/u5cS-rFvdRrpN6iFTGYqDYyF8wMLCtB5-5ir2gQVMaQo8DmURyVdqF8Fyedcx9VW5boiVP8QuQZkL8zAEqG8_TYrkqx6b0bkWajLS-8IJykhlmhtxTH_YEXw_xivXSbd_2rPVLcX" alt=""><figcaption><strong>Left: </strong>an example heightmap image, <strong>right:</strong> partial derivatives (exaggerated for demonstration) that can be used for generating normal maps for lighting, collision, and many other uses in a 3D environment.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Find edges, discontinuities, corners, and image features</strong> – the other application that I will focus much more on is simply finding image features like edges, corners, regions of “detail” or texture; areas where signal changes and becomes more “interesting”. The human visual system is actually built from many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1350218/">edge detectors and local differentiators</a> and can be thought of as a <strong>multi-scale spatiotemporal gradient analyzer</strong>! This is biologically motivated – when signal changes in space or time, it means it’s a potential point of interest or a threat.</p>



<p>The bonus use-case of just computing the gradients is finding the orientation and description of those features. This is bread and butter of any image processing, but also very common in computer graphics – from morphological anti-aliasing, selectively super-sampling only edges, or special effects. I will go back to it in the description of local features in the <strong>Structure Tensor</strong> section, but for now let’s use the most common application – just using the gradient vector magnitude, used for example in the <strong>Sobel operator</strong>: <img width="131" height="55" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XNZ1Arqp0sBJFnwkaJY9qxwOnn75NM57llXbo-aLmwwwPLxv93Sr8qWfaOswcKcWnvc1Hy-HGWKrsW9KHj10G-UkqOICr3SYO_Q6cXWvYBIZu5EALhRiSfp-mqrHpg6rjRFXJpAP">.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B3C3hX34jil9a3GVJJY8e051jxZV-K2v2k0UqMIi9MkajBeYnB8LhKFLMlhRph-8Oe8-R5WyPzWyA9W6X6FISmSwvJ4hPf_adGwpA1Niwpn4qCNkLKYVUTk3ZK5rdLb1guiQu5rN" alt=""><figcaption>Gradient magnitude can be used for simple edge detection in an image, but also many more (described later in the post!).</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Test signals</h3>



<p>I will be testing gradients on three test images:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Siemens star</strong> – a test pattern useful to test different “angles” and different frequencies,</li><li>A simple <strong>box</strong> – has corners that can immediately show problems,</li><li>1 0 1 0 <strong>stripe</strong> pattern – frequencies exactly at Nyquist.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y4CZ84at7ie-Rg3S_l1OQLy0qhoBmxHJXkZukiypUwb55r4dQWIPwGwG1qsdNyKCYqlhkG1TBsaYxOFTXhOFNsCIh47xyYCF5tvX6EhCAXAqORWSOOcWuxs0dF2nSyjyk_4NQan_" alt=""><figcaption>Test patterns / images</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Siemens star was rendered at 16x resolution and downsampled with a <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">sharp antialiasing filter </a>(windowed sinc). There is some aliasing in the center, but it’s ok for our use-case (we want to see a sharp signal change there and then detect it).</p>



<h2>Forward differences</h2>



<p>The first, most intuitive approach is computing <strong>forward difference</strong>.</p>



<p>This is an approximation of <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hPi-mgITwovkqTtAMg1LBk4GVXtKJqG15oSJn0MgJqljSZYk1CiM-mHoGYsW36452xxG3f2X9-72nQ2XVrTknF9v0IanFpTiRHsoGzPk-L_uVBComQrtujBayBlq_uDvpnF5HNVF" width="22" height="39"> by computing f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>What I love about this solution is that it is both intuitive, naive, as well as theoretically motivated! I don’t want to rephrase the wikipedia and most of readers of my blog don’t care so much for formal proofs, so feel free to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">have a look there</a>, or in specialized courses (<strong>side note</strong>: 2010s+ are amazing, with so many best professors sharing their course slides openly on the internet…). It’s basically built around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor expansion</a> of the f(x+1) – f(x).</p>



<p>This difference operator is the same as <strong>convolving the image with a [-1, 1] filter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s easy, works reasonably well, is useful. But there are two bigger problems.</p>



<h3>Problem 1 – even-shift</h3>



<p>If you have <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/15/bilinear-down-upsampling-pixel-grids-and-that-half-pixel-offset/">read my previous blog post</a> – on bilinear down/upsampling – one of challenges might be visible right away. Convolving with an <strong>even-sized filter</strong>, <strong>shifts the whole image </strong>by a half a pixel.</p>



<p>It’s easily visible as well:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Mep5NBimKpkG1wHi1JFZ64tEeZH-Bavx8qZ9abnfIG8f_-vAvZERVKQs84hUSbPSiYkjVmBzyjWbTgL2oSWWyQTwuO1z2xv98LOjHp4pHsD4C09msAmnU9Z5U5Q4VO1rdAIgI24Q" alt=""><figcaption>Images vs image gradient magnitude. Notice the shift to left/top.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depending on the application, this can be a problem or not. “A solution” is simple – undo it with another even sized filter. Perfect solution would be resampling, but resampling by a half pixel is surprisingly challenging (see my <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/04/14/bilinear-texture-filtering-artifacts-alternatives-and-frequency-domain-analysis/">another blog post</a>), so instead we can blur it with a symmetric filter. Blurring the gradient magnitude fixes it (at the cost of blur):</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ki309swxJtWYakp2nypvE4UjcgYC0uHBduyuyWzr_pamfzXFHjSlctrfAx1XPJYjk8LIECMlbRkvumjbT1TJkM225HiIggoy3lnu508mDUyDlHfRB2tog1VY82GLMcP61LK6GOO9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Blurring with an even sized filter fixes the even sized shift. But one other problem might have became much more visible right now.</p>



<p>Note: You might wonder, what would happen if we would <strong>blur just the partial differences</strong> instead? We will see in a second.</p>



<p>But let’s focus on another, more serious problem.</p>



<h3>Problem 2 – different gradient positions for partial differences</h3>



<p><strong>Second problem</strong> is more severe; what happens if we compute <strong>multiple partial derivatives</strong>; like df/dx and df/dy this way?</p>



<p><strong>Partial derivatives are approximated at different positions!</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l11K2D7VeRoitc_dAIwMoC5WB4RPBdcKcdDtq4ysm9z-0LzJICmias8fhGIZQWvdEzJElkTp2xCMRxn1z5EbbYH5xb7Le2AlPFhr4ynlultytNqtm98b1n9d6f_Etu3mMTxpjUiF" alt=""><figcaption>Notice how gradient being defined between pixels means that two partial forward derivatives are defined at different points! This is a big problem.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s have a look at the same plot again, this time focusing on “symmetry”. This shows why it’s a real, not just theoretical issue. If we look at gradients of a Siemens star and the box, we can see some <strong>asymmetry</strong>:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DxZNozMlWMM6xr2c3NejQXpHB9xbiwfs1GyRBeUBQIMoksEisVz5n3jGZs5zWrPZU6xeUvnBaalc3IPTIV8LDoYevY-ZirN-Gsc-XOLwBiGSRzUCuvqIqio3AcmvU5_b1eKzj2aS" alt="" width="507" height="502"><figcaption>Notice left-top gradients being stronger for Siemens star, and producing a “hole” on the box corner. Oops.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is definitely not good and will cause problems in image processing or computing normals, but it’s even worse if we look at the gradient magnitude of a simple “square” in the center of the image – notice what happens to the image corners, <strong>one corner is cut off, and another one 2x too intense</strong>!</p>



<p>This is a big problem for any real application. We need to look at better approximations.</p>



<h2>Central differences</h2>



<p>I mentioned that “blurring” partial derivatives can “recenter” them, right? What if I told you that it is also <strong>numerically more accurate</strong>? This is the so-called <strong>central difference</strong>.</p>



<p>It is evaluated by <img data-attachment-id="4275" data-permalink="https://bartwronski.com/2021/02/28/computing-gradients-on-grids-forward-central-and-diagonal-differences/gif/" data-orig-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" data-orig-size="155,39" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gif" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" data-large-file="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif?w=155" src="https://bartwronski.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gif.gif" alt="">. The division by two is important and intuitively can be understood as dividing by the distance between the pixels, or the differential dx, where dx is 2x larger.</p>



<p>When forward difference was an approximation accurate to the O(h), this one is more accurate, to O(h^2). I won’t explain those terms here, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives">the wikipedia has some basic intro</a>, and in numerical methods literature you can find a more detailed explanation.</p>



<p>It is also <strong>equivalent to “blurring” the forward difference with a [0.5, 0.5] filter</strong>! [0.5, 0.5] o [-1, 1] leads to [-0.5, 0, 0.5]. I was initially very surprised by this connection – of a more accurate, theoretically motivated Taylor expansion, and just “some random ad-hoc practical blur”. This is even sized blur, so this also fixes the half pixel shift problem and centers both partial derivatives correctly:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QawQ4QcbqusIHhs7S0h2kekS4VQDqHCS_WizBd7dgstoHaLu5Lwj9bx_SbJImHNZnlc_aSs7FCzdYF0RW7oYjTTF3qzfoKiNENFh4yzTiYYt_GSO6lkFe-7lP2GpDs0G9XNYS52O" alt="" width="424" height="420"><figcaption>Central difference leads to perfectly symmetric (though not isotropic) results!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Problem – missing center…</p>



<p>However, there is another problem. Notice how the …</p></div></div>

<article>
<header>


<small>2018-04-20</small>
</header>

<p>
	The only operating system I use on my computers is <a href="https://sive.rs/itunes">not Mac</a>, not Windows, and not even Linux.
	It’s <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, and I love it so much.
	So I figured I should say a little something about why, and how you can try it.
</p>
<h3>
	It’s probably not for you.
</h3>
<p>
	It’s not for beginners.
	Most people should use <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>.
</p><p>
	It’s not for people who want to click a button and have the computer hide the details from you.
</p><p>
	If software bloat doesn’t bother you — if every new Mac/Windows/Linux release you say, “Bring on the features! The more the better!” — it’s not for you.
</p><p>
	But if you’re experienced, like to “look under the hood”, and prefer software that does the minimum necessary, OpenBSD is for you.
</p>
<h3>
	What is it?
</h3>
<p>
	It’s like Linux, but has <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/goals.html">different goals</a>.
</p><p>
	It’s known for its focus on security.
	But, like a well-engineered house will also be earthquake-proof, you don’t have to be paranoid about earthquakes to appreciate great construction.
	To me, the security features are just a side-effect of <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/security.html">great coding</a>.
</p><p>
	OpenBSD comes with a secure minimal <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/pf3">firewall</a>, <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/httpd.html">webserver</a>, <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">mailserver</a>, and an optional graphical <a href="http://www.xenocara.org/">desktop</a>.
	So if all you want is a few of those things, you do the default install, tweak one config file, and you’re done.
</p>
<h3>
	Why OpenBSD instead of Linux?
</h3>
<p>
	It’s <strong>uncompromising</strong>.
	It’s not a people-pleaser or vendor-pleaser.
	Linux is in everything from Android phones to massive supercomputers, so has to include features for all of them.
	The OpenBSD developers say no to most things.
	Instead of trying to make it do more, they keep it focused on doing what it does with more security and reliability.
</p><p>
	They <strong>review and remove</strong> code as often as they add.
	If something is unused, unmaintained, or unnecessary, they’ll axe it.
	If it’s unwieldy, they’ll make a <strong>small simple replacement</strong>.
	For examples, see <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/doas">doas</a>, <a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/">OpenSMTPD</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd</a>, and <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>.
	This is great for security, too.
	The more code, the more chance of a bug that could compromise your entire computer.
	The less code, the better.
	Each new release seems to be getting <strong>leaner</strong> by removing old cruft.
	No other operating system does that.
</p><p>
	Great <strong>documentation</strong> is a top priority.
	The built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a> are amazing.
	So if you’re stuck on anything, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apropos.1">searching</a> the man pages on your own computer is going to give you a better answer than searching Google.
	(This makes it nicer to work offline, too.)
</p><p>
	The <strong>installers</strong> are amazing.
	The <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html">initial installation</a> takes like five minutes.
	Hit [Enter] to the defaults, make your username and password, and it’s ready to go.
	Then the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html">software installer</a> is ideal, too.
	Just <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_info.1">pkg_info</a> to search for something and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add</a> to install it in seconds.
	(Which also installs all of its documentation, too.)
</p><p>
	Everything is rock-solid and <strong>just works</strong>.
	Hardware I couldn’t get working in Linux just works on a first try with OpenBSD.
	And because they don’t stay cutting-edge, keeping a cautious pace, it keeps working and doesn’t break.
	The whole system is carefully planned and consistent, instead of a hodge-podge of bits and pieces.
</p><p>
	It’s all free and run by helpful volunteers.
	If you <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/">searched ports</a>, but some application you need is missing or out of date, just contact the maintainer and offer some assistance or money to help get it updated or added.
	I’ve donated $3850 to the developers to help improve the OpenBSD port of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, <a href="http://www.ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a>, and <a href="https://www.qutebrowser.org/">Qutebrowser</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-blog-entry"><article><p>Posted on September 3rd, 2013.</p><p>This post is about writing technical documentation.  More specifically: it's
about writing documentation for programming languages and libraries.</p>

<p>I love reading great documentation.  When I have a question and the
documentations explains the answer almost as if the author has magically
anticipated my problem, I get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  I feel a connection
with the writer that makes me smile.</p>

<p>I also love writing documentation.  Being able to rewire the neurons in
someone's brain so that they understand something they didn't understand before
is extremely satisfying.  Seeing (or hearing about) the "click" when a bunch of
concepts suddenly fall together and make sense never fails to make my day.</p>

<p>This post is going to be about what I think good documentation is and how
I think you should go about writing it.  I'm not perfect, so you should take
everything with a grain of salt, but I hope you'll find it useful and
thought-provoking even if you don't agree with me about everything.</p>

<p>I'd like to say thanks to <a href="http://craigzheng.com/">Craig Zheng</a> and <a href="http://honza.ca/">Honza Pokorny</a> for

<h2 id="s1-prior-reading"><a href="#s1-prior-reading">Prior Reading</a></h2>

<p>Before you read this post there are two other things I think you should read
first.</p>

<p>The first is Jacob Kaplan-Moss' <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/">Writing Great Documentation</a> series.  He's
certainly more qualified than I am to write about this stuff, so you should
check that out if you haven't already.  A lot of what I say here is going to
agree with and build on the ideas he talked about.</p>

<p>The other thing you should read is <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.877,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx">The Science of Scientific Writing</a> by
George Gopen and Judith Swan.  Don't be put off by the fact that it's written
for scientists publishing papers in journals.  Everything in that article
applies equally well to programmers writing technical docs.  Read the entire
thing.  It's worth it.</p>

<h2 id="s2-why-do-we-document"><a href="#s2-why-do-we-document">Why Do We Document?</a></h2>

<p>Let's get started.  The first thing to nail down is <em>why</em> we're documenting
a programming language or library in the first place.  There are many things you
might want to accomplish, but I'm going to boil them down into a single
statement:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of technical documentation is to take someone who has never seen
your project, teach them to be an expert user of it, and support them once they
become an expert.</strong></p>

<p>At first glance this probably doesn't seem too controversial or interesting.
But there's one word in there that makes <em>all</em> the difference, and it frames my
entire perspective on documentation.</p>

<h2 id="s3-teaching"><a href="#s3-teaching">Teaching</a></h2>

<p>If you want to take a person who has never played the guitar and turn them into
a virtuoso guitarist, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them.</p>

<p>If you want to take a high school student and turn them into a computer
scientist, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them.</p>

<p>If you want to take a programmer who has never seen your library before and turn
them into an expert user of it, how can you do that?</p>

<p>You <em>teach</em> them!</p>

<p>Guitar lessons are usually taught in person, one-on-one, with a teacher.
Computer Science is usually taught by professors in classrooms.  Programming
library usage is usually taught by documentation.</p>

<p>If the goal of documentation is to turn novices into experts, then <em>the
documentation must teach</em>.  You should think of your documentation as a lesson
(or series of lessons) because <em>that's what it is</em>.</p>

<p>When writing technical documentation you (usually) don't have the advantage of
having a one-on-one dialog with the learners.  This makes it a bit more
difficult, but not impossible as long as you're careful.  Your documentation
needs to fill the role of both the in-person lessons <em>and</em> the textbook.</p>

<p>The rest of this post will be almost entirely about how to apply the
"documentation is teaching" mindset to writing programming docs.</p>

<h2 id="s4-a-play-in-seven-acts"><a href="#s4-a-play-in-seven-acts">A Play in Seven Acts</a></h2>

<p>I'm going to break up the content of this post with some venting about <em>bad</em>
documentation.  If you want to skip these little rants, go ahead.</p>

<p>Each act in our play has two characters: a teenager and a parent.  The teenager
has just turned sixteen and would like to learn to drive so they can hang out
with their friends without relying on their parents to drive them everywhere.</p>

<p>Each act will demonstrate a caricature of a particularly <em>bad</em> form of
documentation.  I hope these little metaphors will help show why certain forms
of documentation are ineffective cop-outs and why you should write <em>real</em>
documentation instead.</p>

<h2 id="s5-act-1-read-the-source"><a href="#s5-act-1-read-the-source">Act 1: "Read the Source"</a></h2>

<p>Our play starts with a son and father sitting at the breakfast table.  The son
is munching on some cereal before school while the father reads his iPad before
leaving for work.</p>

<p>The son says: "Hey Dad, you said you were going to teach me how to drive after
school today.  Are we still going to do that?"</p>

<p>The father, without looking up from his iPad, replies: "Of course, son.  The car
is in the garage and I laid out a set of wrenches on the workbench.  Take the
car apart and look at each piece, then put it back together.  Once you've done
that I'll take you to the DMV for your driving test."</p>

<p>The son quietly continued eating his cereal.</p>

<p>If you use many open source libraries you've undoubtedly encountered some whose
README says something like "read the source".  Every time I see one, I die
a little bit inside.</p>

<p>Source code is <em>not</em> documentation.  Can you learn to be a guitarist by simply
listening to a piece of music intently?  Can you become a painter by visiting
a lot of museums?  Of course not!</p>

<p>Let me be clear: I'm not trying to say that reading source code isn't a valuable
thing to do.  It is!</p>

<p>Looking at other artists' paintings is extremely useful <em>once you know how to
paint</em>.  Learning how the brakes of a car are constructed can save your life,
<em>once you know how to drive</em>.</p>

<p>Once your library's users know how to work with it, reading its source is
absolutely worth their time.  But you can't look at the finished product and
understand the perspective and ideas that went into it without additional
guidance.  That's a job for documentation.</p>



<p>Writing good documentation doesn't take much in the way of tools.</p>

<p>For example: you don't need a thesaurus.  Don't try to avoid using the same
words by substituting synonyms.  Just talk to your users like you would talk to
another human being in real life!</p>

<p>If you use the same word ten times in a row your readers probably won't even
notice.  But I guarantee they're going to notice if you throw in strange,
uncommon words for no good reason.</p>

<p>There are two tools I <em>will</em> recommend before moving on.  The first isn't
actually a tool, but a skill.</p>

<p>To write great documentation, you need to be able to type.</p>

<p>When you write docs you'll inevitably write yourself into a corner and realize
you need to take a new direction.  If you don't type quickly, you might be
hesitant to throw away writing that doesn't really work.  You need to learn to
type well so you don't feel bad throwing away a chunk of a thousand words that
don't fit.</p>

<p>Steve Yegge's article <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html">Programming's Dirty Little Secret</a> is
a great rant on this topic.</p>

<p>You should also get yourself a nice keyboard.  A good keyboard won't make you
a good writer (just like a good guitar won't make you a good guitarist), but it
<em>will</em> make you want to write more just for the sheer joy of using
a well-designed piece of equipment.</p>

<p>I started practicing guitar a lot more after I got a new guitar that was much
nicer than my old one.  If you spend a hundred dollars, get a nice keyboard, and
end up wanting to write more, it was worth it!</p>

<p>Be thankful that a nice keyboard only costs $100 to $300 and not several
thousand dollars like a nice instrument.</p>

<h2 id="s7-act-2-read-the-tests"><a href="#s7-act-2-read-the-tests">Act 2: "Read the Tests"</a></h2>

<p>The next scene opens with a mother picking her daughter up from high school.</p>

<p>"Hi Mom", she says, "are you still going to teach me to drive today?"</p>

<p>"Yep!" she replies.  "Let's get going."</p>

<p>After ten minutes of driving they arrive at the Chevrolet factory.</p>

<p>The girl looks around, puzzled.  She asks: "What are we doing here?"</p>

<p>The mother smiles and says: "You're in luck, honey, my friend Jim works here at
the Chevy plant, and he's gonna let you watch a few crash tests of the new
Malibu!  Once you see a few cars smash into each other, I'll take you down to
the DMV for your driving test."</p>

<p>Another common form of "documentation" is the README instructing users to "read
the tests".</p>

<p>Tests aren't docs.</p>

<p>Again, let's be clear: once you already know how to use a library, reading the
tests is <em>very</em> useful.  But you need documentation to make you an expert user
first!</p>

<p>You don't learn to drive by watching crash tests.  But learning how your car
behaves during a crash can save your life <em>once you know how to drive</em>.</p>

<p>A common argument I see goes something like this:</p>

<p>"The tests use the library, so they're a good example of how to use it!"</p>

<p>This is true in some very superficial sense, but completely misses the mark.</p>

<p>Most of the tests are probably going to deal with edge cases.  Edge cases are
things a normal user won't be encountering very often (otherwise they wouldn't
be edge cases!).</p>

<p>If you're lucky, you might get a test that verifies the library works correctly
on a normal set of input.  But a "normal set of input" is what the users are
going to be working with the majority the time!</p>

<p>Tests simply aren't a good guide to what a user is going to be encountering on
a day-to-day basis.  They can't teach a novice to be an expert.</p>

<h2 id="s8-how-to-teach"><a href="#s8-how-to-teach">How to Teach</a></h2>

<p>If you accept my idea that the purpose of documentation is to <em>teach</em> users, the
next question is obviously: "How do I teach my users?"</p>

<p>I've been lucky enough to have the chance to teach dancing semi-formally for
around 6 or 7 years, and lots of various other things informally for a long
time.  The only way to …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
<p><strong>OpenNebula 6.0 ‘Mutara’</strong> is the first stable release of the new OpenNebula 6 series. This release comes with a significant number of new functionalities, among which we can highlight the maturity of the new innovative edge features developed in the context of the <a href="http://oneegde.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ONEedge</a> innovation project to deploy on-demand distributed edge cloud environments based on OpenNebula. These new edge computing features enable IT organizations to deploy true hybrid and multi-cloud environments that avoid vendor lock-in, reducing operational costs, expanding service availability, and enabling new ultra-low-latency applications. Organizations maintain a single control panel with centralized operations and management that abstracts cloud functionality and ensures portability across clouds. IT organizations can now automatically deploy and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across edge locations to enable truly multi-tenant and large-scale container orchestration.</p>



<p>These new edge features in <strong>OpenNebula 6.0</strong> include:</p>



<ul><li>A powerful distributed cloud architecture for OpenNebula that is composed of edge clusters that can run <strong>any workload</strong>—both virtual machines and application containers—<strong>on any resource</strong>—bare metal or virtualized—<strong>anywhere</strong>—on-premises and on a cloud provider. This <a href="https://opennebula.io/edge-cloud/">hyperconverged edge cloud solution</a> maximizes workload performance and availability, and comes with a native 3-tier storage architecture that simplifies and speeds up the <strong>deployment of containers and services</strong> across edge locations.</li><li>A fully featured command line interface and a modern, slick web interface—<strong>FireEdge</strong>—to easily manage <strong>public cloud and edge providers</strong> and the seamless provisioning of OpenNebula’s edge clusters. You can quickly expand on-demand your OpenNebula cloud with third-party resources thanks to this point and click interface and create an “Edge as a Service” environment in just a few minutes!</li><li>A first set of templates and drivers to expand your OpenNebula cloud using <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Equinix Metal</strong> resources, creating edge clusters based on QEMU, KVM and <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a>.</li><li>The new support for Dockerfiles and a revamped Marketplace for VM templates, which now is able to store service templates, which considerably improves user experience in the execution of complex container workflows, multi-tier services and management of <a href="https://opennebula.io/certified-kubernetes-appliance/">CNCF-certified Kubernetes</a> clusters on the edge.</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, <strong>OpenNebula 6.0 ‘Mutara’</strong> comes with the following goodies:</p>



<ul><li>There have been multitude of improvements in <strong>Sunstone</strong>: revamped VNC dialogs, asynchronous operation warnings, extra information for OneFlow services, NUMA placement for VMware VMs, etc. Additionally, a new <strong>FireEdge</strong> server is now shipped with OpenNebula, enabling new functionality in Sunstone—OpenNebula’s WebUI: auto refresh for VM and host states, VMRC console access for VMware VMs, Guacamole VNC/SSH and RDP, and more.</li><li>Support for VM <strong>Backups</strong>, periodically save the data of your VMs in a remote storage location set up as a private marketplace.</li><li>Several <strong>OneFlow</strong> improvements, mostly related to the life cycle management of OneFlow Services, both in the engine and the GUI.</li><li>Hypervisor driver improvements like<strong> vSphere 7 </strong>support and additional VM tuning parameters for KVM. OpenNebula 6.0 also features a new driver for <strong>LXC containers</strong>, easing the use of containerized apps across platforms.</li></ul>



<p>As usual, OpenNebula 6.0 codename refers to a nebula, in this case to the <strong>Mutara Nebula</strong>, an interstellar dust cloud located in the Mutara sector of the Beta Quadrant. In 2285, it was the site of the epic battle between the USS Reliant (commanded by the infamous Khan Noonien Singh) and the USS Enterprise (commanded by Captain James T. Kirk), which ended <em>[SPOILER ALERT]</em> with the detonation of the Genesis Device and the USS Enterprise making a last-minute escape thanks to the dramatic self-sacrifice of Mr Spock—as seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_II:_The_Wrath_of_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a> 🤓</p>



<p>The OpenNebula team is now transitioning to “bug-fixing mode”. Note that this is a first beta release aimed at testers and developers to try the new features, and we welcome you to send feedback for the final release. Please check the <a href="http://docs.opennebula.io/5.13/intro_release_notes/release_notes_community/known_issues.html#known-issues">known issues</a> before submitting an <a href="https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/new?template=bug_report.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue through GitHub</a>. Also note that being a beta, there is no migration path from the previous stable version (5.12.x) nor migration path to the final stable version (6.0). A list of open issues can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub development portal</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://nan.fyi/avatar.jpg" alt="Nanda Syahrasyad"></p><p>Nanda Syahrasyad</p></div><p>March 2, 2021</p></div><p>After multiple failed coding assessment tests last summer, I enrolled in the <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview">Grokking the Coding Interview course</a>. The course was different from other data structures and algorithms courses because it focused on common algorithmic <em>patterns</em>. The main idea behind the patterns is this: if you're able to <em>frame</em> a coding problem to match one of the patterns, you're well on your way to reaching an optimal solution.</p><p>While the course itself is incredibly informative, I felt that <em>visualizing</em> the patterns themselves makes them just a bit more clear to understand.</p><p>In this post, I talk about the first pattern that they cover — the sliding window pattern. We'll first walk through a problem without the pattern, then we'll try to iteratively improve our solution, revealing the final pattern in the end.</p><h2>An Addicted Data Scientist</h2><p>Let's pretend that I'm a data scientist that absolutely <em>loves</em> chocolate. As a data scientist, I <em>naturally</em> keep track of the number of chocolates that I eat on a daily basis. One day I wondered — how many chocolates do I eat on average over any consecutive 3 day period? (an every-day question to ask, of course).</p><p>I could do this by hand, but I'm lazy. I also want it to work with <em>any</em> period of consecutive days <strong>and</strong> with any number of data points I may have. So I decide to write an algorithm to answer this question for me.</p><p>The algorithm takes in two parameters — a list of data points <code>chocolates</code>, where each number represents the number of chocolates I ate on a given day, and a number <code>period</code> that represents the period of consecutive days I want to take the average from. The algorithm should output another list of numbers, where each number represents the average number of chocolates eaten over a consecutive <code>period</code> number of days.</p><pre><code>averageChocolatesEaten(chocolates: number[], period: number): number[]
</code></pre><p>For example, if we give the algorithm the list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and the period <code>3</code>, the algorithm's going to return the list <code>[2, 3]</code>. <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> breaks down into two 3-day periods, <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, and <code>[2, 3, 4]</code>, with an average of 2 and 3 respectively.</p><p>How do we design the algorithm?</p><h2>First Approach</h2><p>My first approach to this would be to follow the steps logically:</p><ol><li>Break down the list of numbers to sublists with length <code>period</code> each</li><li>Take the average of each sublist</li><li>Put the averages together</li></ol><p>To build the sublists, we repeatedly take <code>period</code> elements from the list until we hit the end of the list:</p><figure><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div><p>[]</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->8</p></div></figure><p>Since we're already going through each sublist one at a time, we may as well count the sum (and subsequently, the average) as we go. Once we've done that, we have the completed algorithm:</p><figure><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div><p>[]</p><p>sum = 1</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->7</p></div></figure><p>That was easy! We’re not <em>quite</em> done yet though. We can do better.</p><p>On the top right of the animation box you’ll see a number. This number represents the total number of steps the algorithm needs to do to compute its result. Given the list of numbers <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> for example, the algorithm needs 7 steps to get to the final result.</p><p>Let's see what happens to the number of steps when we change the size of the inputs. In the box below, I doubled the size of the data to 8 numbers:</p><figure><div><div></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->19</p></div><p>This is an interactive demo! Press the pencil icon to change the values of chocolates and period.</p></figure><p>Notice the number on the top right again — it jumped up to 19 steps! It makes sense for the number to go up, but maybe there's a way so that it doesn't go up <em>as</em> much as it did.</p><h2>A Window of Opportunity</h2><p>Here's the algorithm again. Do you see anything that seems wasteful or unnecessary? Here's a hint — try to see what happens when we <em>transition</em> from one sublist to the next.</p><figure><div><div></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->13</p></div></figure><p>Let's look at that transition step one more time:</p><figure><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>0</p><p>9</p></div></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->5</p></div></figure><p>When we move from one sublist to the next, we are (quite literally) dropping elements that we have already counted, only to count it again in the next iteration.</p><p>This effect is especially pronounced when the size of <code>period</code> is close to the size of the list of chocolates:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p>1</p></div><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>0</p><p>9</p></div><p>period = <!-- -->5</p><p>[]</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->11</p></div><p>The numbers in red are double counted!</p></figure><p>It turns out that no matter what inputs you give the algorithm, this approach will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself!)</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two sublists, we see that there's a lot of similarity between the two lists:</p><figure><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div></div></figure><p>By starting over every time we reach a new element, we don't take advantage of this similarity. If we're somehow able to calculate the average for both sublists without double counting, we would be able to cut down on a lot of needless steps.</p><p>As a matter of fact, there's a way to do exactly that!</p><p>Notice that for the example above, the sum of the second sublist is equal to <strong>the sum of the <em>first</em> sublist minus one and plus four</strong>:</p><figure><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div><p>sum: <!-- -->6<!-- --> </p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->3</p></div></figure><p>Generally speaking, the sum of the second sublist is the sum of the first sublist, minus the first element of the first sublist, plus the last element of the second sublist. Using this formula, we can <em>derive</em> the sum of the next sublist from the current one, ultimately avoiding the need to recount everything all over again. By doing this, we reduce the number of steps needed to count the sum from <code>period</code> steps to only one step!</p><p>If we do the subtraction and addition in one step, it's as if we're <em>sliding</em> a <em>window</em> (see where I'm getting at here?) of elements from one sublist to the next:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p></div></div><p>sum: <!-- -->6</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->2</p></div></figure><h2>Rewriting the Algorithm</h2><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - a list of numbers <code>chocolates</code> and the period of consecutive days <code>period</code>.</p><p>The sliding window trick only takes into effect when we transition from one sublist to the next. At the start, we don't even have a sublist, so we have to build the sublist as we did before — by iterating through the first <code>period</code> elements.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p></div></div><p>period: 3</p><p>sum: <!-- -->1</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->3</p></div></figure><p>Then, we use our sliding window trick to slide to the next sublist. Again, what we're really doing here is subtracting the first element of the original sublist and adding the last element of the next sublist. We use this sum to calculate the average of the list and add that average to the final result.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p></div></div><p>period: 3</p><p>sum: <!-- -->6</p><p>result: <!-- -->[]</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->4</p></div></figure><p>Finally, we keep sliding until we hit the end of the chocolates list.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p></div></div><p>period: 3</p><p>sum: <!-- -->9</p><p>result: <!-- -->[

]</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->3</p></div></figure><p>Putting all three steps together, we get the final algorithm:</p><figure><div><div><p>Building window 🚧</p><div><div><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>3</p><p>4</p><p>5</p><p>6</p></div></div><p>period: 3</p><p>sum: <!-- -->1</p><p>result: <!-- -->[]</p></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->7</p></div></figure><p>And there you have it — the sliding window pattern!</p><p>Based on these examples alone, we see that this new version does seem faster — the original algorithm takes 7 steps for a 4-length input, while the sliding window algorithm takes the same amount of steps for a 6-length input.</p><p>This doesn't seem like a fair comparison though, so let's do a test. How would the two algorithms compare when we give it the exact same inputs?</p><figure><div><div><h4>Sliding Window 🏎</h4><h4>Old Algorithm 🐌</h4></div><div></div><p>1<!-- --> / <!-- -->22</p></div><p>The animation speed is set to 400ms for both implementations!</p></figure><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of <code>period</code> to the size of the list — both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the old algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>A pattern wouldn't be much of a pattern if it works for only one use case. What makes the sliding window pattern a pattern is that it secretly hides in a bunch of other similar problems — typically those that involve sublists, subarrays, or substrings. The chocolates problem is just one costume the sliding window pattern puts on.</p><p>Generally speaking, the pattern needs:</p><ol><li>A window, i.e. a fixed range of elements</li><li>A <strong>state</strong> to maintain in that window</li><li>A way to <em>derive</em> the next state using <em>only</em> the current state and the stuff that enters or leaves the window</li></ol><p>"Only" is the keyword here — if we need to go through the <em>entire</em> window again, the pattern wouldn't be any faster than the way we were doing it before.</p><p>The chocolates problem that we were working through meets all of this criteria:</p><ol><li><em>A window</em> — the consecutive period of days</li><li><em>A state to maintain in that window</em> — the total sum of the numbers in the period of days</li><li><em>A way to derive the next state solely by the stuff that enters or leaves the window</em> — to get the next sum, take the current sum, subtract the number that leaves the window and add the number that enters the window</li></ol><p>To end it off, let's look at one more problem that, unfortunately, has <em>nothing</em> to do with chocolates.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any permutation&nbsp;of that pattern.</p><p>For example, given the string aaacb and the pattern abc, the algorithm should return true because aaacb contains acb, which is a permutation of abc.</p><p>Before I show you the solution, see if you can frame this problem to fit the sliding window pattern in. Try to use the criteria that we've defined in the previous section.</p><hr><p>Done? Awesome. A bit stuck? No worries. We'll go through the criteria one-by-one to see if we can use the sliding window pattern to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>1. The window</strong></p><p>Figuring out what the window would be is a bit tricky because the problem doesn't explicitly tell you what the size of the substring is.</p><p>If we look back at the definition of a permutation though, we can conclude that two strings of <em>different sizes</em> can never be permutations of one another! After all, the longer string will <em>always</em> have more characters than the other, so you can never rearrange it to create a shorter string.</p><p>Since we're trying to match substrings with the pattern, we can conclude that <strong>the window is the substring of length <code>pattern.length</code></strong>.</p><p><strong>2. A state to maintain in the window</strong></p><p>One way to figure out what state to maintain is to trace back from the result you want — what information do I need to determine if the substring in this window is a permutation of the pattern?</p><p>A way to check if two strings are permutations of each other is to see if they …</p></article></div>

<h2 id="ScalingEthereumOneTxAtATime"><a href="#ScalingEthereumOneTxAtATime">§</a> Scaling Ethereum One Tx At A Time</h2>
<h3 id="Mar12021"><a href="#Mar12021">§</a> Mar 1, 2021</h3>
<p>With regards to building rugpullindex.com, there are currently two problems
bugging me. One is that gas prices on the main net are insanely high right
now. And two is that the Ethereum front end space has become even more
hostile than what I was used to before.</p>
<p>In a recent post over on my blog, I've made the argument that "<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2021/02/22/ethereum-isnt-fun-anymore/">Ethereum isn't
fun anymore</a>"
and that "<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid idea</a>".
Though I've earned some criticism for these posts, I'd now like to double down.
I have an alternative vision for web3. Purely from a pragmatic, architectural
point of view.</p>
<p>I've written it in long-form over in the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3304">Ethereum/EIPs issue
section</a> already.  We need to
start thinking practically about light clients now. Ironically, full nodes are
costing developers real dollars today. And building truly decentralized
applications is hardly possible anymore without a credit card—the irony.</p>
<p>I guess nobody designed the Ethereum protocol with light clients in mind.
Still, I think there are small fixes, applied here and there, that could help
dramatically improving user experiences in web3's front ends. So what's the
plan?</p>
<h4 id="ScalingWeb3viaWebRTC"><a href="#ScalingWeb3viaWebRTC">§</a> Scaling Web3 via WebRTC</h4>
<p>Just recently, <a href="https://web.dev/webrtc-standard-announcement/">WebRTC was made a W3C and IETF
standard</a>. WebRTC (or Web
Real-Time Communication) is a concept for sharing data directly between users'
web browsers without going through middlemen like servers. "Over the past year,
WebRTC has seen a 100X increase of usage in Chrome due to increased video
calling from within the browser.", the article states. But WebRTC cannot only
be used for distributing video. Reasonably, we can use it to spread any data.
And one data that I've ranted about not being distributed well enough is that
of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<h4 id="andViaWebTorrents"><a href="#andViaWebTorrents">§</a> ... and Via WebTorrents</h4>
<p>WebTorrents allow us to download torrent files directly from the web.
<a href="https://instant.io/">instant.io</a>, for example, enables a user to paste in a
magnet link to download it within the browser instantly. A client could now
easily send a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magnet_URI_scheme&amp;oldid=999476988">magnet
link</a>
to start syndicating files.</p>
<p>In general, torrents have a rather bad reputation, mainly as they've been a
driver of piracy in the past. However, speaking of their technical properties,
torrents are like one of the coolest technologies around.</p>
<ul>
<li>They guarantee file integrity through hashing (similar to content-addressing)</li>
<li>They have built-in incentivization that can drive seeding</li>
<li>Their scale increases with the number of participants (or seeders) increasing</li>
<li>They are "proven" technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how does WebRTC, WebTorrents and Web3 fit together?</p>
<h4 id="ethtorrentADecentralizedWeb3Provider"><a href="#ethtorrentADecentralizedWeb3Provider">§</a> ethtorrent, A Decentralized Web3 Provider</h4>
<p>WebTorrent utilizes WebRTC in browser environments. It can fall back into a
<a href="https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-hybrid">webtorrent-hybrid</a> for
server-side usage. What's fantastic is that WebTorrent has a <a href="https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-dht">distributed hash
table built-in</a>. It even allows
specifying a custom hash function. So what's the plan?</p>
<p>For now, the plan is to democratize the access of blockchain data for regular
web3 apps again. The first step towards this will be creating a lean component
that we can use with web3.js. Its goal is to cache and store all requests from
web3.js that have to do with a full transaction or an entire block. We will
await the response, cached for these requests, and offer it for download on
WebTorrent via a custom DHT.</p>
<p>If a second client comes along, for each request they make towards the full
node's RPC endpoint, it will be interrupted, and instead, will consult the
WebTorrent's DHT first. In case the retrieval of a transaction is possible via
torrents, it will make no RPC endpoint call.  That is good for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infura and others bill by requests/day. For an application that needs scale,
this can incur relatively high costs. Decentralized applications shouldn't be
bound to the creator's solvency. After all, smart contracts aren't.</li>
<li>Infura is centralized. If it stops working, the reliant dapp starts working
too.</li>
<li>Many dapps need to send the same data to the same users. It's mostly related
to the application's state at a specific moment. If all users could come in
sync quickly when starting up the application, that'd improve a dapp's user
experience dramatically.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="WhatNeedstoHappenNow"><a href="#WhatNeedstoHappenNow">§</a> What Needs to Happen Now?</h4>
<p>I'm not sure if I'll handle this project as part of rugpullindex.com. However,
only through it, I had the idea for it. In any case, I think building the
project shouldn't be too much of a hassle as WebTorrent comes with batteries
included. As a start, I'll attempt to create a library that can bootstrap the
Ethereum WebTorrent network for sharing transactions and blocks. Then, I'll
build a simple bootstrapping node capable of talking back to an archive node
for eventually missing transactions or blocks in the DHT.</p>
<p>Then, I think it's a question of whether the idea is accepted and used by the
Ethereum community. However, a web3 provider could significantly reduce the
number of requests a dapp does daily; I could imagine there be a will to give
it a try.</p>
<p>And that's how I want to contribute to scaling Ethereum for now. I hope you
enjoyed reading. Feel free to let me know your thoughts by reaching out to me.
My email is on my blog.</p>
<p>That's all for today.</p>

<h2 id="Feb242021"><a href="#Feb242021">§</a> Feb 24, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: Yesterday, I added anchors to each headline on this page, e.g.
<a href="https://rugpullindex.com/blog#the-algorithm%3B-it's-working!">https://rugpullindex.com/blog#the-algorithm%3B-it's-working!</a>.
However, for links that have a punctuation character at the end, Whatsapp and
Telegram didn't end up making them clickable. They think a user wants to end
a sentence with the exclamation mark character and not that it's part of the
link. I now fixed the problem by removing all special characters from anchor
links.</li>
<li>I designed and added the rugpullindex.com logo. It's a rug with a <code>#</code> :)</li>
<li>I submitted <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/rugpullindex-com-round-3-proposal/434">my
proposal</a>
to the OceanDAO's Round 3</li>
<li>Bug fix: Crawler used to run at midnight in "Europe/Berlin" time zone and not
UTC. That has caused numerous problems in the past. To make it all work, I
had to perform an unscheduled crawl before relaunching the server. It could
have been that the site was down for a few minutes. Anyways, now working in
the backend should go more smooth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TheAlgorithmItsWorking"><a href="#TheAlgorithmItsWorking">§</a> The Algorithm; It's Working!</h2>
<h3 id="Feb232021"><a href="#Feb232021">§</a> Feb 23, 2021</h3>
<p>On Feb 18, 2021, the maintainer of the "<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:C1e2dcCC25ed82AcF79e233780c0f613B1229F82">Oceancap - Datapool Evaluation and
Charting"
(ADASTA-60)</a>"
data set tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.) We decided to
close our Oceancap pool on 21/02 due to the market situation. We are pretty
sure that <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oceanprotocol</a>
is working hard on preparing an updated Marketplace in the near future. We are
waiting on the sidelines and take a break for now.</p>— Oceancap -
Datapool Evaluation and Charting (@OCharting) <a href="https://twitter.com/OCharting/status/1362450997050761229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February
18, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Since rugpullindex.com listed ADASTA-60 in its TOP 25 index for a while, I was
curious how the ranking algorithm would react to the announcement. Remember,
the algorithm ranks a data set based on its market's performance. It works
"autonomously" and isn't capable of comprehending the statement—instead, it's
rating each data set by its market's performance. Our thesis is that if a data
set's market is strong, its value is high too and vice versa.</p>
<p>Here is ADASTA-60's performance within the context of the announcement:</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>Looking at the market's data, we can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The share equality of liquidity providers to ADASTA-60's pool has historically
been somewhat on the centralized side, meaning a few LPs had lots of control.
The factor "Gini," close to 1, shows this clearly.</li>
<li>Within just roughly a week, ADASTA-60's liquidity dried up, resulting in a 4x
decrease.</li>
<li>Its price tanked too; ADASTA-60 fell from 20 OCEAN last Wednesday to 4 OCEAN
(5x).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion">§</a> Conclusion</h4>
<p>rugpullindex.com's initial thesis that markets are a proxy for data sets has
found some evidence in this particular case. rugpullindex.com successfully
forecasted an investment risk (Gini-Index close to 1) before it manifested
itself. Its algorithm is now automatically decreasing ADASTA-60's stake as the
market reacts to the announcement.</p>
<p>I find this result excited as it's the first time we can see the
collected data and my work in action. 🥳</p>
<p>In the future, I want users to gain the same insights I was able to acquire
today. I'm excited to continue working on that.</p>
<p>Best, Tim</p>
<h2 id="Feb172021"><a href="#Feb172021">§</a> Feb 17, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Further adjustment of ranking algorithm. I had forgotten adding liquidity in
EUR in one subquery.</li>
<li>Added data base index to improve performance of uncached request to root <code>/</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Feb162021"><a href="#Feb162021">§</a> Feb 16, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Refactor some code: I simplified the query that constructs the index ranking.
Over the long term, this change will allow me to make adjustments with more
confidence about the system's correctness.</li>
<li>Ranking now uses Liquidity in EUR to create a relative ranking among data
sets.  See post from Feb 12, 2021 for details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Feb152021"><a href="#Feb152021">§</a> Feb 15, 2021</h2>
<p>As announced on Feb 12, 2021, liquidity and price are now displayed in EUR.
However, EUR values are not yet used within the ranking algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="Feb142021"><a href="#Feb142021">§</a> Feb 14, 2021</h2>
<p>Midnight: After months, I made some changes to the crawler again which lead the
page to be down the last two nights. The reason was a bug in the price crawler.</p>
<p>I was trying to get OCEAN's current EUR price and I was using Coingecko's
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/coins/get_coins__id__history">historical
API</a>,
that didn't send back any results (because it's "historical" and not
"present" time). The crawler is now using Coingecko's <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3#/operations/simple/get_simple_price">simple
API</a>
to get the price.</p>
<p>A few reflections on what I learned by having to open my
laptop before breakfast and before going to bed on a Saturday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having to be responsible for a website on the weekend is painful.</li>
<li>Running a crawling script at midnight is good for the user and bad for me. I
only ever find production bugs at night or in the morning. The users probably
never notice...</li>
</ul>
<p>Working on a website that always displays new information is fun. I check

<br/>

	<p>From <a href="https://omarshehata.me/notebook">Omar's notebook</a>.</p>
	<hr>
	
	
	<p>
		If you pull up a tuner app on your phone and play an A note on a piano, the tuner will say ~440 hz. Do the same thing on a violin's A note and you'll also get 440 hz.  
	</p>
	<p>
		This seemed impossible based on my understanding of sound, which was: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Our ears perceive sound by picking up on the frequency of the air vibrating around us.</li>
		<li>Two sounds are different if they have different frequencies, in the same way two colors appear different if they emit light of different wavelengths.</li>
		<li>When we say a sound is 440 hz, that means a point vibrating along that sound wave makes a complete cycle 440 times per second.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		So if two sound waves have exactly the same frequency, according to my tuner app, they cannot possibly sound different. But they do! Does that mean there's something else, something <i>more</i> than frequency that can differentiate sound? 
	</p>
	<p>
		There isn't! That's all sound is - vibrations in the air of some specific frequency. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Was the tuner lying? Yes, kind of: when we say a sound is 440 hz, that's not actually a complete description of the sound. It's kind of like telling you a shape has 4 points - you might assume it's a square. But it could be a rectangle, or some completely wacky irregular polygon. 
	</p>
	<h2>Visualizing a couple notes</h2>
	<p>
		Here's an A note from a piano and a violin that I recorded from online virtual instruments. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Click "Play" to hear them. Below each is a small slice of the audio. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Drag and drop your own sound file in these diagrams to use it throughout the article.</p>
	<p>
		They look structurally similar, but they're <i>not</i> the same sound wave. They both have a pattern that repeats ~3 times in 9 milliseconds (or ~440 times per second). So that's what makes them both 440 hz.
	</p>
	<p>
		But that pattern itself that repeats is different. This is why saying "A sound is 440 hz" isn't a complete description, so assumption (3) for me was a misunderstanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is what the sound would look like if the speaker vibrated exactly 440 times per second in a continuous, regular, motion.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The fact that all 3 of these sound different, even though they are all made of a pattern that repeats at 440 hz, tells me I need to tweak assumption (1). Our ears don't pick up on just a single frequency in the air. If they did, these sounds would be indistinguishable (which I think actually happens for our eyes, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)">metamerism</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		So our ears can detect the internal structure of these patterns. To decompose this structure on a computer, we'll use the Fourier transform.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Performing the Fourier Transform
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm allows you to extract frequencies in a signal.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our signal in this case is a list of amplitudes, how loud the sound is at every sample.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you run the signal through like <code>FFT(signal)</code> you get a list numbers that correspond to a list of frequencies. For example, if the FFT output looks like this:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0.001, 0.1, 0.7, 0, 12, 0, 2, 1]
	</code></p><p>
		You'll also have a corresponding list of frequencies:
	</p>
	<p><code>
		[0, 55, 110, 220, 440, 880, 1320, 1760]
	</code></p><p>
		We interpret this to mean 440 is the most significant frequency in this signal, because its FFT coefficient is 12 (the largest), and it's the 5th number. And the 5th frequency in our list is 440. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found it easiest to interpret the results of FFT by putting it in a table in terms of the original sound frequency and the relative weights, <b>so I divide all of them by the largest number and multiply by 100</b>.

		These tables tell us that both sounds do have ~440 hz as the strongest frequency, but there's other frequencies inside too! The violin one appears a lot more complex, in that it seems to contain a lot more frequencies that contribute significantly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The last step is reconstructing the sound from this table. Representing sound this way is really powerful. This is the basis for a lot of sound analysis/transformations like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Compression?</b> Remove the highest frequencies that our ears can't hear as easily. </li>
		<li><b>Noise filtering?</b> Remove specific known frequencies, that's how you can remove the sound of car horns but keep your voice in a recording.</li>
		<li><b>Auto tune?</b> Check which musical note is closest to the list of frequencies in the sound, and alter/remove/add frequencies to make it sound closer to the note.</li>
		<li><b>Voice recognition?</b> You can think of the frequencies you can create by talking as a unique pattern a software can search for. Like how the letter "E" appears ~11% of the time in most English text. We all have a few frequencies in our voices that appear with predictable probability.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Below is a sandbox for you to explore these ideas of sound reconstruction.
	</p> 
	<p>
		The code returns a <code>outputMultipliers</code> array that scales the original frequencies. A new sound is reconstructed from those new frequencies/weights. You can try <a href="#" id="zero-out">zero-ing out all the high frequencies</a>, or isolate <a href="#" id="single-frequency">a single frequency</a>.

	<h3>
		Takeaways
	</h3>
	<p>
		So the correct version of assumption (3) is: When we say a sound is 440 hz, we mean that's the frequency with the most weight in the signal. To give a complete description of the sound you need to know (1) all the frequencies it's made of and (2) how much of each frequency to use.  
	</p>
	<p>
		I created this to learn how FFT works. This is the end-to-end demonstration I was looking for to help me understand it. It's best used to test your understanding while reading other materials. I don't have the source code up yet but if you'd like to extend this or use it as a teaching tool just let me know! 
	</p>
	<p>
	 	You can drag and drop any sound file in the very first two figures and all figures will update to use it, including the FFT tables and the code sandbox. Here's a few notes from <a href="https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/">Philharmonia</a> you can try dragging in:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/banjo_a4.mp3" download="">Banjo A note</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://omarshehata.me/static/whoisomar/images/notebook/sound/flute_a4.mp3" download="">Flute A note</a></li>

	</ul>
	<p>
		A few key points I needed for a correct implementation:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>How to retrieve the original frequencies from the FFT output.</b> The FFT only tells you the frequency in terms of how often it repeats in the list of samples. So you need to multiple by the sample rate (like 44100 for most sound) to get frequency per second (Hz). Most FFT libraries in JS do NOT give you a list of the frequencies (just the coefficients). The formula for figuring out what frequency corresponds to what coefficient <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4364823/how-do-i-obtain-the-frequencies-of-each-value-in-an-fft/4371627#4371627" target="_blank">is described here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to take a small slice of the audio.</b> Given that the frequency of the sound changes over time, even when playing a single note, you won't get accurate/expected frequencies if you FFT the entire thing. For example, a piano note has an "attack" and a "decay", you want to take a slice from the middle. 
			<ul>
				<li>See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform">Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)</a>. This is computing FFT for a small slice of audio as we just did, but do this for all slices of the audio. You'll get a list of frequencies over time. This is often visualized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>You have to sample an integer number of cycles.</b> If you take an arbitrary slice of a pure A note, you likely will get a lot more than 440 in your FFT table, unless you happen to pick a start and an end that matches a multiple of the cycle length. This article automatically shortens any slice to the nearest cycle (we figure that out by finding the nearest sample where the signal crosses the Y axis). This is also important when playing the reconstructed sound on loop (otherwise you hear a popping sound).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>The discrete fourier transform (DFT) doesn't include all possible frequencies.</b> In theory, FFT is a continuous sum (AKA an integral) of all possible frequencies in the audio. What we have implemented here is a discrete version, where we sum a finite list of frequencies. In a small slice you may not get 440 exactly as an output, only because it wasn't included as a frequency the algorithm was looking for. I <i>think</i> in principle you could have an implementation that allows you to specify what frequencies must be included (if you know what you're looking for) but I haven't seen such an implementation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>FFT isn't magic.</b> A popular analogy is that FFT can take a smoothie and extract all the component that went into it. But this seems impossible??? The trick is the FFT comes in with an assumption of what frequencies might be in there. We go through each possible frequency and ask "How much 440 hz is in this sound?" and "How much 880 hz is in this sound?" and so on. So it's closer to having an unknown substance and figuring out what it is by checking if it reacts to known chemicals/substances.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A few insights I learned from exploring the code sandbox:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The sum of all the frequencies &lt; 1 weight have a big effect.</b> I had these hidden in the FFT tables thinking they weren't significant, and any one of them isn't, but removing them altogether does have a very noticeable effect. Here's a <a href="#" id="remove-low-weight">code snippet</a> (scroll up) that removes all frequencies with weight less than 1. Or try the opposite, listen to only weights less than 1.</li>
		<li><b>The high frequencies are a big part of the violin sound.</b> Removing anything at 5000 hz and up makes it no longer really sound like a violin (or just sound really muted). This isn't true for the piano.</li>
		<li><b>A string tuned to 440 hz will never emit frequencies any lower than that</b>. This is true because of the physics of standing waves, but it was really cool to learn about this in theory, and then go back to this interface and see that this was indeed true for all the recordings of notes I had! Without …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk just recently announced that the Silicon Valley-based automaker is transitioning towards LFP batteries in order to eliminate the costly and supply-constrained Nickel.</p>



<p>He took to Twitter to answer a few questions in regards to limited Model 3 production, “This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells,” said Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Currently, Tesla is in the process of shifting its Standard Range <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Model 3</a> and <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Model Y</a> battery chemistry to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.</p>

<h2>Nickel vs. Iron</h2>



<h3>Prices</h3>



<p>Nickel’s price has reached a 5-year high, it closed at $18,607 per ton at the time of market close yesterday. The following graph shows Nickel’s price variation across the last 5 years, the price starts climbing at the start of the year, peaks during the mid to start of Q4, and then start to decline towards the year’s end. However, it is setting a record high price each year except for 2018.</p>

<p>Although the price of Iron Ore (~62% Fe) is also rising throughout the last 5 years, especially since 2019, it still stands at $172.71 per dry metric tonne as of the time of this writing. This gives Iron a huge price advantage over Nickel, a reason as big or even bigger than the supply limitation of Nickel. This is why Elon Musk said, “Nickel is our biggest concern”.</p>



<h3>Conductivity Comparison</h3>



<p>When we look at the electrical conductivity of the Nickel (22%) vs. Iron (17%), it is clear that using an iron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cathode</a> in batteries reduces the flow of current. But to achieve the same level of conductivity as nickel from the iron cathode, the amount of iron will need to be increased, and since it’s available plentiful and cost-effectively, more use of iron should be a profitable decision for <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a>.</p>

<p>Since Tesla’s Standard Range vehicles are not geared towards performance or track racing, so changing the original formula and compensating for conductivity should not affect the end product as much. This is the reason Tesla has chosen the Standard and Standard Range Plus variants for the LFP or iron cathode batteries.</p>



<h2>Tesla’s diversified cathode approach</h2>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">Battery Day presentation</a> last year, Elon Musk and Tesla SVP for Powertrain and Energy Drew Baglino stated that Tesla is working on eliminating Cobalt content in their cell chemistry. Cobalt is another super expensive material that is currently priced at $51,800/Ton.</p>



<p>One of the Battery Day presentation slides named ‘Diversified Cathode Approach’ (see Fig 5 below) — showed how Tesla has split different cathode materials over the vehicle lineup.</p>

<p>Tesla has divided its vehicle lineup into three categories, Standard Range batteries will have iron-based cathodes. Long Range vehicles and Tesla Powerwall will be powered with Nickel+Manganese cathodes. The mass-sensitive <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/semi-truck/">Tesla Semi</a> and the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Cybertruck</a> that require a large number of batteries and towing capacity will be powered with high Nickel content cathodes.</p>



<h2>LFP batteries in Made-in-China Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y</h2>



<p>Tesla Model 3 cars produced at the Gigafactory Shanghai have already transitioned to LFP batteries. Tesla’s Chinese battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL) supplies <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-shanghai/">Giga Shanghai</a> with LFP batteries for use in the MIC Model 3 and Model Y.</p>



<p>The use of CATL’s prismatic batteries in a Model 3 battery pack reduces the production complexity and time, just like the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 cells</a>. The following imaginative rendering of a Model 3 battery pack with LFP prismatic batteries is imagined by my co-authors over at CleanTechnica.</p>

<p>The prismatic battery pack eliminates the need of gluing together thousands of cells together and distributing them into 4 modules and further into bricks inside the modules. Late Jack Rickard of EVTV once disassembled a Model 3 battery pack and I wrote a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://evannex.com/blogs/news/tesla-s-battery-pack-is-both-mysterious-and-alluring-work-in-progress" target="_blank">detailed article on his video for Evannex</a>, his teardown analysis is helpful in understanding the tiny details of a Tesla battery pack. </p>

<p>Sometime after the implementation of the LFP batteries in Chinese Model 3 cars, rumors start spreading that these batteries are having issues with charging in cold weather. Since it is difficult to get information from Chinese owners due to the language barrier, we had to wait for MIC Model 3s to be shipped to Europe. Looks like initially the MIC Model 3 owners in Europe were having issues but the 2021.4.10 <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/ota-updates/">OTA software update</a> seems to have fixed the issue.</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, a German owner of the Made-in-China <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> posted the following video that shows the Supercharging is working flawlessly on his LFP battery pack Model 3. He also gives us a detailed walkaround of the car for a visual checkup of panel gaps and quality issues — the build quality of MIC Model 3 is on par with European cars, let’s witness first hand.</p>

				<p><span>In the last month we’ve made many improvements to Flow, some of which were prompted by feedback from the previous Pi release. The most obvious useability feature is paste support for the welcome page URL bar. We’ve also made it possible to run Flow on all Raspberry Pi computers.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/PiZero.jpeg" alt="" width="292" height="172"></p>
<p>Earlier Raspberry Pis have a different GPU to the one used on the Pi 4 and Pi 400. They are similar except the earlier GPU only supports OpenGL ES 2.0 rather than OpenGL ES 3.0 which the Pi 4 and Pi 400 support. It therefore made sense for us to target these earlier Pis as a way to exercise Flow’s wider OpenGL ES API support. A lot of STBs and other embedded hardware only offer OpenGL ES 2.0, so Flow’s support for them makes sure we aren’t excluding a chunk of that market.</p>
<p>When we recently added WebGL, Flow’s minimum OpenGL ES API level was increased from 2.0 to ES 3.0. We use Google’s <a href="http://angleproject.org/">ANGLE</a> library as part of our WebGL implementation, as does Chromium, although the way we used it had OpenGL ES 3.0 dependencies in a couple of places. We could have made Flow available without WebGL for OpenGL ES 2.0 platforms, but we didn’t really want to restrict the functionality, so we worked around this.</p>
<p>Flow also requires hardware acceleration which isn’t enabled by default on X11 for earlier Pis. The ‘Fake KMS’ GL Desktop driver is needed for this.</p>
<p>The updated Flow preview is now available on our <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">download</a> site. We’ve run it on the Pi Zero, Pi 1 and Pi 3. The Pi 1 with 256MB is unusably slow because it doesn’t have enough memory so is swapping all the time. None of these are really fast enough for open internet browsing, but for bespoke content they are fine.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Managing data is hard. Managing data pipelines is even harder. The meaning of individual tables or values in your data warehouse gets lost in translation across organizations. Another team’s refactor breaks your team’s pipeline. And, it’s normally very difficult to tell who made what change and when.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, data build tool, alleviates these frustrations by taking over the transformation step in your ETL pipelines. <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what--exactly--is-dbt-/">dbt is not itself a data processor</a>, but instead sits on top of your data warehouse that contains your already extracted and loaded data. dbt allows teams to easily test, document, and version-control their data transformations.</p>
<p>While dbt is a great tool for transforming batch data, it cannot currently transform streaming data in real time. (The dbt team explicitly warns users about this in a <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/is-dbt-the-right-tool-for-my-data-transformations/">few</a> <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">places</a>.) Here at <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, we want to help the world stop batching and start streaming. So we* built a dbt adapter that will allow you to transform your streaming data in real time using Materialize as your data warehouse.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will explore why dbt works best with batch data and how using Materialize unlocks streaming transformations. If you’re eager to get started, the <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize">dbt-materialize adapter is here</a>, and our <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/play/wikirecent-dbt">sample streaming project is here</a>. Note: The dbt-materialize adapter is an <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/5462">active work in progress</a> and not yet suitable for production use-cases. Please file issues or submit PRs as you see fit, we love feedback!</p>
<p>*The dbt-materialize adapter was originally created by Josh Wills and actively shaped by Jeremy Cohen. Thank you for all of your work and support!</p>
<h2>dbt and batch data</h2>
<p>dbt is great at transforming batch data, but it cannot transform streaming data efficiently in real time. To understand why, let’s take a look at how dbt transforms data under the hood.</p>
<p>dbt users define their desired transformations using <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/">dbt “models”</a>. dbt models are SQL files that contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SELECT statement that performs the desired transformation</li>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations/">“materialization”</a> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>dbt transforms your data each time you <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/run/">“run”</a> a model. Each time a model is run, dbt queries the underlying data warehouse using that model’s SELECT statement. The result set of the query (the transformed data) is then either returned directly to the user or persisted into your data warehouse, depending on the model’s materialization parameter.</p>
<p>Currently, dbt supports four types of materializations: <em>table</em>, <em>view</em>, <em>incremental</em>, and <em>ephemeral</em>. The <em>table</em> and <em>incremental</em> materializations persist a table, the <em>view</em> materialization creates a view, and the <em>ephemeral</em> materialization, instead of persisting anything, returns results directly using a common table expression (CTE). The good news is that these database objects are totally sufficient to transform batch data. The bad news is that none of these database objects transform streaming data efficiently.</p>
<p>First, what do I mean by batch and streaming data? Batch data, as the name suggests, is any type of data that arrives in discrete batches. This can be once a minute, once an hour, or once a day. The important thing is that no new data arrives between batches. Streaming data, on the other hand, arrives continually and at no particular schedule.</p>
<p>So, why are these database objects sufficient to transform batch data, but not able to efficiently transform streaming data?</p>
<p>Views and CTEs do not physically persist data to your data warehouse. This means that each time you query a model that uses a view or CTE, your data warehouse must re-transform the underlying source data. And, each time you transform your source data, you are paying some cost. While views and CTEs always return up-to-date transformations of your batch and streaming data, they do not do so efficiently.</p>
<p>Tables, on the other hand, do physically persist data. More specifically, tables persist the result set of the last time their model “dbt run.” Unlike views and CTEs, this means that you won’t pay the price of transforming data each time your table is queried. But, this means that your transformed data can quickly become stale as new data arrives. This is not an issue with batch data because you can simply “dbt run” your table each time a new batch arrives. Unfortunately, things aren’t so simple with streaming data.</p>
<p>Because streaming data does not arrive on a schedule, there is no longer a right time to re-run your models to keep them up-to-date. Instead, you’re forced to choose between maximizing data freshness and minimizing transformation costs. You can minimize your costs by limiting how often you recreate your tables, effectively turning your streaming data into batch data. Or, you can maximize your data freshness by continually recreating your tables. But, this approach will cost you time and money, leave you vulnerable to bugs, and still won’t maintain truly up-to-date results.</p>
<p>So, what should you do if you want to transform streaming data with dbt?</p>
<h2>dbt and streaming data</h2>
<p>dbt currently has one official and one unofficial way to approximate transforming streaming data. Neither of these methods truly transforms streaming data in real-time, and both come at a cost.</p>
<p>The first method to approximate transforming streaming data is to create models with an incremental materialization. The first time you run an incremental model, dbt persists your transformation’s result set into a table in your data warehouse. For subsequent runs, dbt only transforms the subset of source data indicated by your model’s filter predicate. (For example, you might have a filter predicate that will only transform data with a timestamp greater than your last model’s run.)</p>
<p>While incremental models reduce the severity of the tradeoff that users face when persisting their transformations in tables (data freshness vs cost), they do not eliminate the tradeoff entirely. By design, you will probably be paying a lesser cost each time you “dbt run” an incremental model. (I say “probably” here because even though you’re only transforming a few rows of data with each run, unless you’re filtering cleverly, your model’s SELECT statement will still have to scan the entire underlying source table or view to discover these rows). While these lesser costs may free you up to run your incremental models more frequently, you still will not be able to run them continuously. By definition, you are still transforming your streaming data with a batch process.</p>
<p>The second way to approximate transforming streaming data is the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-create-near-real-time-models-with-just-dbt-sql/1457">unofficial “lambda view” approach</a>. This method simulates transformations over “near real-time models” by querying a combined historical table and a current view. This approach incurs the cost of querying both of the underlying database objects using some filter, similar to the incremental materialization. The current view of your data returns up-to-date results, but must re-transform the recent data each time.</p>
<p>Neither of these methods can efficiently transform data in real time. (And, they come with <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/on-the-limits-of-incrementality/303">hairy problems</a> if, say, you have streaming data that might arrive late.) In order to efficiently perform worry-free, real-time transformations of streaming data, dbt would need to persist a database object that updates as new data arrives upstream. Luckily, there is a database object that can do this for us: materialized views.</p>
<h2>dbt and Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialized views in traditional databases behave a bit like dbt’s incremental materialization. When a materialized view is first created, the result set of its query is physically persisted in the database. Then, at some interval or when manually triggered, the stored result set is updated with recent data. Like the incremental materialization, maintaining these materialized views incurs a variety of costs.</p>
<p>This is the exact problem Materialize was created to solve. Unlike traditional materialized views, <a href="https://materialize.com/why-use-a-materialized-view/">our materialized views</a> continually update as new data arrives–no refreshes needed. Better yet, we provide up-to-date results with millisecond latency. (For more information about Materialize and our materialized views, check out <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/">our documentation</a>.)</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for dbt and streaming data? This means that the first time you run a dbt model on top of Materialize, dbt persists a materialized view. <strong>Then, you never have to run your model again.</strong> No matter how much or how frequently your data arrives, your model will stay up to date. No matter when you query your view, it will return a fresh answer. Just by creating your model with our materialized views, you can confidently and efficiently transform streaming data in real time.</p>
<h2>Try it out!</h2>
<p>Excited? Skeptical? Cautiously optimistic? Try it out for yourself! As mentioned before, we have a <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/dbt-materialize">beta dbt-adapter</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/play/wikirecent-dbt">demo streaming project</a>. If you have any thoughts, questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact us in our community Slack or in our dbt repos.

<p>Programming is deep work. Tuning out distractions is key, and music is one of the most effective tools at your disposal.</p>
<p>But not all music helps you program. Music with lyrics can interfere with your ability to read and write code. Music with too many surprises can add rather than remove distraction. After some experimentation, many programmers arrive at the same conclusion: repetitive electronic music helps them program.</p>
<p>After a couple decades of programming, including a decade of remote work with the awesome musician-programmers at <a href="https://blend.io/">blend.io</a> and <a href="https://roli.com/">ROLI</a>, here's some of the music I turn to when I need to Get Shit Done. All music has a Spotify embed and a quick review. Know the mood you're after? Start with this index of mental states. YMMV. Enjoy! ✌️</p>

<h2>Playlists</h2>
<p>If you're not sure where to start, pick one of these 2+ hour playlists and dig in. These artists have deeper catalogs you can branch out into.</p>
<h3>Deep Dark Minimal</h3>

<p>Repetitive, trance-inducing electronic music for intense focus and deep work. No vocals or lame chord progressions. Mostly German.</p>


<h3>Modern Acid</h3>

<p>The tasty sounds of the 303 / 707 / 808 / 909 used in new ways. All tracks post 2000. Higher energy, faster tempos, and busier arrangements for active brains. 🧠</p>


<h2>Albums</h2>
<p>Some full-length albums that won't disappoint. Each is good for about an hour of listening.</p>
<h3>Microlith: Dance With Me</h3>

<p>An album of sublime electro from Maltese producer Rhys Celeste. Everything Rhys made until his <a href="https://ra.co/news/38277">tragic death at age 24</a> is worth a listen. See also <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4CvNSwKn7f9ngVLlP2Jr0O">Float House</a>.</p>


<h3>Beatwife: Cornbrail Acid 2</h3>

<p>A Scottish acid madman with an artist name you can't mention in polite company. Fast, frenetic music with a quirky sense of humor. See also <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/braindance-feature">Braindance</a>.</p>


<h3>Tin Man: Dripping Acid</h3>

<p>How much acid is too much acid? This monster neo acid album may provide the answer. Haunting, hypnotic tunes with slow builds.</p>


<h3>Mikron: Severance</h3>

<p>Peaceful, aquatic, ambient techno landscapes from an Irish duo. "Ghost Node" emerges triumphant from the fog.</p>


<h3>Anthony Naples: Fog FM</h3>

<p>Another foggy one with some breakout surprises.</p>


<h3>Boards of Canada: Music Has The Right To Children</h3>

<p>By law I am required to include this album. I'm happy to comply. A landmark in electronic music from the Scottish duo. As good today as it ever was.</p>


<h3>Maurizio: M-Series</h3>

<p>Minimal dub techno from the master of the genre, <a href="#basic-channel-sampler">Basic Channel</a> co-founder Moritz von Oswald. If you're new to dub techno you may be forgiven for thinking "nothing ever happens." That's kind of the point, but it's also not <em>quite</em> true: there's lots of subtle variation if you start looking for it, but never enough to distract if you aren't.</p>


<h3>TM404: TM404</h3>

<p>Even darker minimal dub techno from Swedish producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Tilliander">Andreas Tilliander</a>.</p>


<h3>CN: The Expedition Beyond</h3>

<p>The year is 3984, and this is the soundtrack to our mysterious space explorations. CN is one of several projects from the outrageously talented and prolific Norwegian producer <a href="https://eodtracks.bandcamp.com/">Stian Gjevik</a>. There's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0YPxzyy8doEk5wh5XT0AkW?si=gUmFatscRnKPufh5M1SfpA">a second album</a> that picks up where this one left off.</p>


<h3>Martin Schulte: Slow Beauty</h3>

<p>Ambient that gets its inspiration from nature. While most music is busy painting portraits, these tracks are content to paint landscapes. If you like this stuff, Schulte has a whole series of albums exploring different seasons and places.</p>


<h3>Four Tet: New Energy</h3>

<p>Natural inspiration in this one too, which comes to you from a cabin in upstate New York.</p>


<h3>Steve Reich: Music for 18 Musicians</h3>

<p>A minimalist classical masterpiece from 1976 that anticipated electronic music as we know it: layering, envelopes, precise rhythms, repetitiveness, gradual rather than sudden harmonic changes...it's all in there. I find it incredible that 18 skilled humans can approximate dense electronic like this. Structurally, 18 Musicans is interesting too, as the interior sections are organized around a cycle of eleven chords. Lots to uncover in repeat listens.</p>


<h3>Terry Riley: In C</h3>

<p>The granddaddy of all minimalist classical masterpieces. For about an hour we never leave the key of C. Unlike Spinal Tap, Riley pulls it off. It's a fascinating and elevating listen.</p>


<h2>EPs</h2>
<p>These are half-albums that nonetheless stand out as excellent music to work to. They vary in length, but are ½ an hour on average.</p>
<h3>EOD: Utrecht</h3>

<p>Lush synth landscapes collide with hard-edge acid techno, leaving you stranded in the best of both worlds. <a href="https://eodtracks.bandcamp.com/">EOD</a> is Norwegian producer Stian Gjevik's main shingle. His melodic gift and impeccable arrangements are on full display here.</p>


<h3>EOD: Questionmarks</h3>

<p>On this EP Gjevik strips away the lushness and really lets the hard-edge techno rip. The sweet melodies and intricate arrangements are still there, but there's an urgency and raw speed that verges on frightening. Don't worry: Gjevik is a professional driver on a closed course.</p>


<h3>Automatic Tasty: Fieldwork EP</h3>

<p>Morning, afternoon, evening, night. What a nice four-part cyclic structure for an EP! Although the instrumentation borrows from the somewhat-dated sounds of early techno, Dillon also weaves in real field recordings from different times of day. The result is charming and feel-good.</p>


<h3>The Field: Sound of Light - Nordic Light Hotel</h3>

<p>Another four-part day cycle EP from Sweden. True to form, these tracks are driving, repetitive, and awash in sound -- the kind of thing that makes you hitch up the sled dogs and log a couple hundred miles of frozen tundra. This is music you can really get lost in.</p>


<h3>DMX Krew: Broken SD140 Part II</h3>

<p>What is an SD140, and are we sure it's safe to use a broken one? I have no idea, but it sounds great. Harsh electro rhythm sounds topped with sweet melodies. "Apple Grid" is a standout.</p>


<h3>Khotin: Baikal Acid</h3>

<p>Dancy, imaginative acid house from up north. Khotin saves the best for last: side B has not one, but two lovely, warm tunes.</p>


<h3>Jonas Kopp: Desire EP</h3>

<p>German minimal techno by way of Argentina. It's dark, but the opener is funkier than your typical Tresor track, and the deep-breathing closer feels like some kind of...weird ascension ritual?</p>


<h3>Etapp Kyle: Klockworks 10</h3>

<p>Dark, driving, haunted minimal techno of the German variety. All of the albums on <a href="https://ra.co/dj/benklock/biography">Ben Klok's</a> Klockworks series are worth a listen, but Klockworks 10 and 16 from this Ukranian producer are standouts.</p>


<h3>Luke Hess: Facette</h3>

<p>Modern Detroit minimal techno. A propulsion system made from deep, dark textures and thumping beats.</p>


<h2>Artist Samplers</h2>
<p>Some artists don't fit well into the album box. And some artists make albums of such breadth that they no longer fit into the "music to work to" box. Here's a few sampler playlists from artists not featured above, but no less deserving.</p>
<h3>Basic Channel - Sampler</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Channel">Basic Channel</a> is legend. They more or less invented minimal dub techno. Except for BCD and BCD-2, their output consists of a series of cryptically labeled singles. Here's a curated selection.</p>


<h3>Trickfinger - Sampler</h3>

<p>Did you know John Frusciante -- yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frusciante">that John Frusciante</a> -- has a side gig making acid techno? Insane. I guess that explains the name. There are a couple tracks here where it really does sound like he plucked out techno melodies on the guitar.</p>


<h3>Ceephax - Sampler</h3>

<p>No list would be complete without Andy Jenkinson, AKA Ceephax. Personally I like his stuff more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squarepusher">his brother's</a>. It's funny, nostalgic, a bit unhinged, and full of bonafide musical genius.</p>

March 1, 2021 | https://blog.repl.it/https | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.repl.it/https">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The easiest, fastest way to put a server on the internet should also come with secure defaults. That's why we're excited to announce that Replit is now HTTPS-first, which brings additional privacy, integrity, and security benefits to servers hosted on our platform. This applies to every <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">HTTP server repl</a> on Replit.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/secure_hosting/repl_flask_example.gif" alt="example_flask_repl"></p>

<p>Our hosting infrastructure makes it easy for anyone to instantly have a secure, HTTPS-secured server by default without having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>Any repl can open up a port and we'll automatically give it a publicly-accessible URL. Routing requests from the internet through to individual repls is handled by a component of our infrastructure we call the proxy.</p>
<p>On Replit, HTTPS-first means that the proxy will redirect any HTTP request to a server repl to HTTPS before it even reaches your app. Additionally, we serve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security headers</a> to clients to ensure that they know to make future requests over HTTPS instead of HTTP. This makes the easy path and the secure path one and the same.</p>

<p>Replit is responsible for around half a million HTTPS certificates. The proxy is responsible for requesting, storing, serving, and renewing these certificates using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment protocol. </p>
<p>ACME allows us to programatically request HTTPS certificates from certificate authorities such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. Essentially, ACME provides methods for us to prove to Let's Encrypt that we do in fact control the names that we're requesting certificates for. If we can do this, then Let's Encrypt will grant us certificates that are widely trusted by modern operating systems and browsers.</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>We use two types of ACME validation to prove that we control the names we're responsible for: HTTP-01 and DNS-01.</p>
<h3 id="http-01">HTTP-01</h3>
<p>HTTP-01 validation is a straightforward way to prove that we control our names. The ACME server gives us a token, and then all we have to do is respond to that challenge by providing a specific token at a path on the domain under <code>/.well-known/acme-challenge/</code>. This is typically very quick to validate.</p>
<p>HTTP-01 is the method we use to issue certificates for <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">custom domains that serve repls</a>. Since those domains must already have CNAME records pointing at the proxy, we can do this without requiring the domain owner to make any other changes.</p>
<h3 id="dns-01-and-wildcard-certificates">DNS-01 and wildcard certificates</h3>
<p>DNS-01 validation is a more flexibile type of validation, though it requires more moving parts and is typically slower than HTTP-01 (on the order of a few dozen seconds.)</p>
<p>This type of validation requires that we control the DNS records for a given name. This is true for the URLs that we provide to every server on Replit, i.e. the repl.co domain.</p>
<p>DNS-01 validation also has a unique feature: we can use it to issue wildcard certificates. On Replit, we issue every user a certificate that is valid for <code>*.&lt;user&gt;.repl.co</code>. This is important because it means that we only have to issue one certificate per user regardless of how many servers they have. We only have to pay the user experience cost of requesting a new certificate the very first time that any of a user's repls receive traffic, and then any new server repls from that user can immediately use the previously-issued wildcard certificate.</p>
<p>To do DNS-01 validation, we tell our DNS provider to set a TXT record at <code>_acme-challenge.&lt;user&gt;.repl.co</code> with the value that the ACME server provides. Once we observe that our DNS provider is serving this record, we ask our ACME server to validate the challenge. If it also sees that the record has the expected value, then our certificate request is granted and we've successfully requested this user's new wildcard certificate.</p>
<h2 id="renewals">Renewals</h2>
<p>Our certificate authority, Let's Encrypt, issues certificates that are valid for only 90 days. This means that certificate renewal must be a very regular process for us.</p>
<p>On any given day we typically renew between 5,000 and 10,000 certificates. Whenever we handle an HTTPS request, we check how much lifetime is left in the certificate. If it expires in fewer than 30 days then we'll renew the certificate using the same process that we used to issue the certificate initially.</p>
<p>To account for our ACME provider's rate limits and renewal hot spots when many certificates are issued at approximately the same time, the proxy will enter a conservation mode where it defers certificate renewals when we don't have any spare ACME orders remaining for our account. This ensures that we can still issue brand-new certificates at any given moment. Because we start trying to renew a certificate with 30 days of lifetime remaining, there's no interruption of service if we delay renewal by a few hours, days, or even weeks. We also have a circuit breaker that will ignore order conservation and always kick off a renewal if a certificate we're using is very close to expiration.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/secure_hosting/curl_example.png" alt="example"></p>

<p>HTTPS-first is a milestone for our vision of how easy, simple, and fast web hosting should be. <a href="https://blog.repl.it/deploy">We've been iterating on hosting for almost three years</a> and we think you'll be thrilled at <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1359553366590779399">what's in store</a>.</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">Always On</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Database</a>, and <a href="https://docs.repl.it/">the huge suite of tools</a> on Replit, there's no better place to build.</p>
<p>Thank you to the team at Let's Encrypt for the wonderful service they provide. They are essential to allowing us to deliver HTTPS to everyone on Replit.</p>
<p>Happy coding! We can't wait to see what you make.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A common situation: Things are going fine, but not great at your SaaS business. Your sales team’s win rates aren’t quite high enough. Your marketing pipeline isn’t quite as full as you’d like. Your customers are happy but some are considering other solutions. Overall, your product doesn’t quite feel differentiated enough.</p>

<p>A natural temptation that I’ve seen in this situation is to look to machine learning as the solution to your differentiation woes. If we just sprinkle a dash of the ol’ ML on this bad boy, the thinking goes, we’ll have a product that stands out in the market and that everyone will love. In general, this strategy just doesn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-not-unique">Machine Learning Is Not Unique</h2>

<p>First – at this point in time, everybody vaguely knows what machine learning is and has a rough sense for its capabilities. You’re not getting a jump on the market by declaring that you’re going to make your product “powered by AI.” Every Gartner report has some checkbox about building intelligent or predictive features, and it’s no longer a secret that there appears to be some magical pixie dust out there that you can drizzle on your product to make it special.</p>

<p>Using machine learning to differentiate your product is like driving a fancy sports car to stand out when picking someone up for a date. It can be cool, it might even fit your persona, and <em>some</em> people will be impressed. But ultimately it isn’t revolutionary or inherently game changing.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/ml-wont-save/russ.jpg" alt="Tres comas">
We have an ML product, now are you interested?</p>

<p>ML is a buzzword of the moment – and investing in buzzwords is not the route to enduring differentiation. There’s always some technology that’s gotten enough mindshare that everyone is sharing blog posts, frantic manifestos are being written, and investors are hot and bothered. 2 decades ago it was cloud, it’s currently (roughly speaking) machine learning and crypto, and who knows what it will be next.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that ML features are useless – if it’s useful, people will pay. But there is essentially no novelty left in the ML play. Even if the underlying trend is meaningful (for example, cloud transformation was and continues to be a big deal!), the biggest trends rapidly become table stakes.</p>

<h2 id="a-lot-needs-to-go-right-for-ml-to-work">A Lot Needs to Go Right for ML to Work</h2>

<p>The barrier to building a profitable, differentiating ML-driven product is high – not only in a technical sense, but also in terms of the role that it solves for your business. It can’t just be slapped on top of your product like salad dressing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to have an ML application that fits your business model – for example, if ConvertKit (which Stay SaaSy uses for our newsletter) adds a crazy send-time-optimization product, that might simply not matter for sites like us that use them to email out blog content</li>
  <li>You need a problem that <em>you</em> can solve but <em>others</em> can’t. In reality, you are probably not orders of magnitude smarter than your competition</li>
  <li>You need to solve a problem that has a tangible business impact – only the most frivolous buyers will purchase something just because it’s cool technology</li>
  <li>You need to actually prove that whatever ML magic you’ve built actually solves a key problem better than anyone else can, or for that matter solves a real problem at all</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/ml-wont-save/emeril.png" alt="Bam!">
Let’s just slap some machine learning on there, and Bam!</p>

<p>A situation that checks all of the boxes above is the holy grail, but you need to be honest about whether that’s the case. It’s very possible that you’d be better off trying to differentiate your SaaS product by <a href="https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/11/04/selling-to-the-enterprise-expand-playing-field.html">creating a suite of functionality</a> or investing heavily in UX – both strategies that many companies have used to construct defensible product moats.</p>

<p>The concept of provable value is one of the most unknown or unappreciated elements of building a sellable ML product. The more that you can prove that you’re adding revenue or reducing costs, the stickier your revenue will be. When the rubber hits the road and something needs to get cut, the products that add value in a provable and (ideally) deterministic way are the ones who survive.</p>

<p>Many customers want to verify the results of anything that they’re paying for, and black boxes understandably scare them. Hype has created a litany of startups peddling ML snake oil and buyers are rightfully skeptical. This increases the barrier to entry and means that it’s much harder to build an enduring ML product. Not only does your product need to work, but you often need to build significant reporting functionality that allows customers to dissect your product and verify the advantage that you claim to provide. And keep in mind that many customers will approach the problem of analyzing whether your algorithms add value adversarially – teams that wanted to build ML products in-house rather than buying yours will be especially aggressive critics and naysayers.</p>

<h2 id="the-promise-of-machine-learning-as-a-silver-bullet-is-distracting">The Promise of Machine Learning as a Silver Bullet is Distracting</h2>

<p>Perhaps the worst part of hoping that you can dust magical machine learning on top of your product is that it trains you to look for silver bullets. ML feels like a new, magical solution that will solve all of your problems. In reality magic solutions are near-mythical and it’s dangerous to believe in them.</p>

<p>The earlier your startup, the worse the optics of saying that you’re going to dominate your market by sprinkling machine learning on your product. If you have terabytes of unique data and claim that it will unlock the portal to Machine Learning Narnia, or if you have a unique approach and track record that indicates true expertise, reasonable listeners will hear you out and not immediately assume that you’re full of it. But if your non-specialized team is trying to raise some kind of seed fundraising on the back of a machine learning story (“We’re just going to do X, but with ML”), then it should be obvious that you don’t have anything vaguely proprietary. At best, you look overly optimistic; at worst, you look like you have no idea what ML actually entails. Unfortunately, some people will pump you up and make you believe that this strategy is viable –&nbsp;the rest will roll their eyes at your “.ai” domain once you leave the room.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? I think it’s because the talk track “we’re going to do X but with AI” does work on a certain kind of unsophisticated observer. If boasting about ML products is like driving a McLaren, there are indeed investors / buyers who are the equivalent of someone who is really, really captivated by a fancy car. You can’t count on this to be an enduring advantage.</p>

<h2 id="where-machine-learning-matters">Where Machine Learning Matters</h2>

<p>Where I’ve seen machine learning make the biggest difference is in extending a lead that you’ve already earned. An example of where ML can really set a product apart is Photoshop’s ability to do <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/10/20/photoshop-the-worlds-most-advanced-ai-application-for-creatives.html#gs.mqvj9d">automatic skin smoothing and sky replacement</a>. This is some hardcore stuff, and Adobe has checked the box on the narrow domain where ML products can make a huge difference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have the data and team to solve this problem well</li>
  <li>They have a platform (Photoshop itself!) where automatic image manipulation software can be plugged in to add significant value</li>
  <li>You can actually observe that their technology works.</li>
  <li>Photoshop already exists as the most sophisticated graphics editing software, so adding more sophisticated features on top of it extends their advantage on the market</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the technical moats that it can create machine learning functionality can be a great accelerant when it works well. But you simply can’t rely on it to be the singular differentiator for your business.</p>

      <div><p>In theory, the hard part about finding capital for unproven founders with unproven technologies in unproven markets should be that no one wants the risk. There was a time when that was true, but it isn’t anymore.[1] For a founder, the issue is different: venture capital is abundant, but it’s not very evenly distributed.[2]<br></p><p>There are groups of founders to whom this uneven distribution is an advantage. These founders are well connected or pedigreed and can use their access to capital as an advantage in building their startups. That’s good for them, and they should use every advantage they have.</p><p>But the world of startups would be better overall if capital could more easily find great startups. That should be a given, but in looking at the various bottlenecks in the system, it is clear that, at least some of the time, some of the parties involved are actively impeding access and distribution. Other bottlenecks are the result of the fact that venture markets are immature.</p><p><b>Manufactured&nbsp;impedance</b></p><p>Professional investors are in something of a bind when balancing accessibility and exclusivity. On the one hand, the best investors generally believe that returns are driven by significant outliers. These outliers are unlikely to come from an expected source or pattern match precisely on previous outliers. This means that investors would be best served by having the largest possible funnel and the least biased filtering mechanisms. In other words, investors should treat any and all inbound investment opportunities as potentially incredible and equal weight their attention to them.</p><p>However, this presents a set of problems. Investors who tout their willingness to look at everything equally and actually do so will lose their auras of exclusivity. This aura is important in convincing founders to contact the investor and later when investors try to win deals - when given the opportunity, most people choose exclusive clubs over inclusive clubs.</p><p>Then there’s the practical problem: capital may be abundant, but good people and their time are scarce. Let’s say, for instance, an investor decides to follow the “evaluate all inbound” model. This investor actively markets that she’ll meet every company that emails her. The strategy works and the emails pour in.</p><p>That investor will then need the time to meet hundreds of companies each week. Software can help route and filter, an application process can eliminate some number of in person meetings, but the investor will need partners and staff to deal with volume.[3] New partners and staff cost money, which means raising more funds. Larger teams and larger funds start to impact exclusivity, as does the greater numbers of investments dictated by adding people and looking at more companies.[4] Investors who want to pursue the abundance path will get caught in a recursive loop that seems dangerous to their model.</p><p><b>Structural&nbsp;impedance</b></p><p>The other set of barriers to capital distribution exist because venture markets are relatively new and immature. There are many markets without local venture capital investors. Foreign investors may be interested, but face challenges in understanding the nuances of those markets and those founders.[5] This impedes the flow of capital to companies that should get it.</p><p>Because venture markets are relatively new, they are also unnecessarily opaque. Information within these markets is rightly viewed as incredibly valuable, and so it is rationed by those who have it. This makes it hard for new entrants with money to figure out where to put that money. Instead, LPs are required to route it through the professional venture investors that have access to information about what companies are raising and which are not. The analogy here would be an equities market which forced university endowments to call hedge fund managers to discover what stocks exist.</p><p>There are a number of other structural bottlenecks to evening out the distribution of capital. What is so interesting about these and the manufactured bottlenecks is that they could all be solved by either a new common set of behaviors, or an intermediary that made it significantly easier for startups to access the sources of capital already looking for them.[6]</p><p><i><br>This is the second in a set of essays drawn from watching the interactions between investors and founders during several hundred Series A and B in the last few years. If you are wondering how this dynamic impacts your company, please reach out at&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.aaronkharris.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2d4c6d4c4c5f424346454c5f5f445e034e4240"><span data-cfemail="82e3c2e3e3f0edece9eae3f0f0ebf1ace1edef">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</i></p><p>__</p><p>[1] See <a href="https://blog.aaronkharris.com/abundant-capitalhttps://">https://blog.aaronkharris.com/abundant-capital</a></p><p>[2] Apologies to William Gibson for bastardizing one of my two favorite quotes about the future and technology. The other is from Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."</p><p>[3] Operating under the assumption that the investor can successfully generate inbound interest.</p><p>[4] Partners at venture funds are primarily evaluated on the quality of their investments. This means they have to actually make investments, especially early in their careers.</p><p>[5] When Rappi first launched, US investors failed to understand the radical differences in their economics relative to US counterparts. These differences were driven by dramatically lower employment costs and urban densities that were only apparent if you’d studied Latin America enough.</p><p>[6] To some extent, YC’s Demo Day does this for seed stage companies. However this function has not yet been replicated at later stages.</p></div>

<p>Some asked if this post is about Snorkel. It’s not. Snorkel is an exception. It’s a great startup, which is a reason why I joined in the first place, and I recommend it to all my friends who are looking to join a startup.</p>

<h2 id="why_not_join_a_startup">7 reasons not to join a startup</h2>

<h3 id="1_work_life_balance">Reason 1. Goodbye work-life balance</h3>

<p>A friend at a tech giant told me that he and his co-workers once mused about how long they could go on not working until someone noticed. The answers were between a week and two months. At an early-stage startup, the answer is likely a couple of hours.</p>

<p>My transition from NVIDIA to Snorkel was a culture shock. At NVIDIA, you can have a predictable schedule, e.g. coming in at 9am and leaving at 6pm every day. If you don’t finish something by Friday afternoon, just push the deadline to next week and go to happy hour. It’s okay, even expected, to not check emails or Slack for the entire weekend.</p>

<p>On my first day at Snorkel, when I left at 7pm, I was the first one to leave.</p>

<p>Nobody told me how to spend my time, but when everyone else worked over the weekend and responded to my Slack messages any time of the night, I wanted to do the same. Nobody forced me to take on a hefty task that would require me to cancel plans with friends, but I also knew that everybody else had their hands full and if I didn’t do it, we wouldn’t be able to finish this feature on time and the company would lose a contract or even die.</p>

<p>By the time that I left, the work-life balance had got a lot more balanced. Snorkel had hired a ton more people to share the workload and we had worked out processes to speed things up.</p>

<p>In general, I’ve observed that the bigger the startup, the better the work-life balance. Possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The earlier the startup, the more precarious its survival, and the harder everyone has to push.</li>
  <li>In very early-stage startups, the working culture is dominated by those with high ownership in the company (the founding team), who are incentivized to work harder. Later on, the working culture is dominated by people with much lower ownership in the company (e.g. 0.1% over 4 years for the 20th engineer vs. 20% for the founder), who are more incentivized to keep a work-life balance.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: The work-life balance at an early-stage startup depends a lot on how much the existing team members work. When interviewing at a startup, don’t ask the founders how much they value work-life balance (they’ll say “A lot”), but ask every team member you can talk to how much they work. If all of them work during evenings and weekends, you might likely feel pressured to do the same.</p>

<h3 id="2_bad_engineering">Reason 2. You’ll pick up bad engineering practices</h3>

<p>Consider the following scenario. A customer requires a new feature and you have to deliver it in a week. This feature is similar to one of your existing features, so the best solution is to refactor the existing code to allow some of it to be reused.</p>

<p>However, refactoring alone would require a week. Your tech lead decides that you should just duplicate the existing code and turn it into a new feature. Now you have two massive code structures that are similar but not quite. When making changes to one structure, you have to remember to change the other too.</p>

<p>Then, somebody forgets and a wild bug appears. The person assigned to fix it isn’t given a lot of time, so instead of investigating the duplicate code, they write a hacky function on top.</p>

<p>Startups build 1 from 0, something from nothing. <em>Adding new things fast</em> takes precedence over both <em>adding good things slow</em> and <em>fixing existing things</em>. You might get used to writing quick and dirty code, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult programming</a>, merging code that has no tests, merging before tests complete, committing without comments, spaghetti code, magic numbers.</p>

<p>Bad practices might be a mere dissatisfaction at first, but can gradually become a habit, then become the only way you know how to work.</p>

<h3 id="3_mentorship">Reason 3. Less mentorship</h3>

<p>The thing I missed the most when leaving NVIDIA was mentorship. Large companies, by virtue of having a lot of employees, tend to have many people whose diverse life experience can provide you invaluable advice. At NVIDIA, I could come to my mentors for questions from general career dilemmas to obscure engineering knowledge. Once in a while, I browsed the org chart of tens of thousands of employees, identified people I want to learn from, and asked them to meet at the coffee machine, which they usually accepted.</p>

<p>Startups don’t have that many people for you to reach out to in the first place. Your handful of coworkers might have backgrounds and experiences similar to yours (cue founders who say they prefer hiring from their existing networks) and are unlikely to give you dramatically different perspectives. Even if there are people who could mentor you, given the pace at which startups move, they might not have the time for it.</p>

<p>To be clear, you can still learn a lot from your coworkers at startups, just a different kind of learning.</p>

<h3 id="4_equity">Reason 4. You won’t get rich</h3>

<p>Despite a plethora of articles warning people that joining startups is a bad way to get rich (<a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">1</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">2</a>, <a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/sorry-startup-employee-100-your-equity-probably-won-t-make-you-rich-d6549ece71bd">3</a>), many people still think joining a startup is a get-rich-quick scheme. Here’s the gist of the math. Imagine you’re an <strong>engineer with 2-3 years of experience</strong>.</p>

<p>If you join a startup as the <strong>15th engineer</strong> (not executive), your compensation might look like the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Base salary</strong>: Your base salary is usually lower than you would have got at a big company (e.g. <strong>$120K instead of $160K</strong>) because at startups, equity makes a large chunk of your compensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Equity</strong>: You might get <strong>0.05% - 0.25%</strong> equity vested over <strong>4 years</strong>. After subsequent fundraising rounds, this amount of equity is diluted to <strong>0.02% - 0.1% for 4 years</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<strong>If you join late at the startup (say employee number 100+), even if the company succeeds wildly, your equity will be worth very little.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to get rich, join a big company and climb their rank. You can find the detailed analysis of compensations for 19,000 FAAAM-dominated tech workers <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html">here</a>, but below is a plausible, even conservative, scenario if you join a company like Google with 2-3 years of experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st year, L4 $250K/year.</li>
  <li>2nd year, L4, $280K/year.</li>
  <li>3rd year, L4, $320K/year.</li>
  <li>4th year, L5, $360K/year.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the first 4 years at Google, you’ve already made over $1 million, not counting “perks” like work-life balance.</p>

<h3 id="5_management">Reason 5. Bad management</h3>

<p>There’s a trend among startups to not fixate on titles until they have to. Some avoid “manager” to not endanger the “everyone is equal” mindset (protip: everyone isn’t equal at startups – some have much more equity than others). In the early stage of a startup (e.g. before the 20th employee), there might not be anyone with “manager” in their title. If you join during that phase, you’re expected to get things done with little to no guidance.</p>

<p>Even if your startup has managers, they are likely bad managers. A startup’s first managers are likely its founding team who might have little to no real-world working experience, let alone managerial experience (e.g. recent dropouts, recent graduates). It doesn’t mean that people without working experience can’t be good managers (I know a few), it’s just more rare.</p>

<p>Bad management can manifest in the lack of feedback. At startups, you might get a lot of work-specific feedback – demos, design docs, even code (though it might not be good feedback) – because people at startups are generally more invested in the company. However, you won’t get much you-specific feedback that can help you grow such as what skills you’re lacking or what you need to do to get to the level you want to get to.</p>

<p>Even if there are processes in place for feedback, everyone might be too caught up in sprinting to think about you, what you want, or what opportunities they can give you to grow.</p>

<p>Bad management can be especially frustrating during conflicts, which will inevitably arise when you work in a high-stress environment (e.g. you’re all trying to push a feature at 11pm on a Saturday, everyone is tired and snappy). When something bothers you, you might feel like there’s no one you can talk to because you either …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Site optimization is important and if you're reading this post, I assume we're on the same page with why. I won't tell you that faster sites see more traffic, conversions, and overall engagement. Or that they rank better in search results. Or that it makes for a better experience overall. </p><p>(Nevermind, I just told you anyway.)</p><p>Instead, here's a 95%-of-the-way-there guide to optimizing your site for speed and performance. </p><p>It's 95% because I've focused on the free and mostly-not-technical things that will solve the majority of your challenges. If you need more technical solutions past this guide, then there's something significant that needs unique attention and I can't help you. But I <em>can</em> guarantee that this will solve almost every major problem you have. Especially if you're using Wordpress. </p><h2 id="index-">Index:</h2><ul><li>Testing your site's speed</li><li>What causes performance issues?</li><li>Getting to 80%: Fixing Images</li><li>Getting to 90%: Scripts, Fonts, Cruff Code</li><li>Getting to 95%: CDNs, Caching, Preloading</li><li>Getting to 96%: Bonus on live chat tools</li></ul><p>Let's get started!</p><hr><h2 id="testing-your-site-s-speed"><u>Testing Your Site's Speed</u></h2><p>There are a few ways to test site speed and performance:</p><h3 id="3rd-party-tools">3rd Party Tools</h3><ul><li><a href="https://romandesign.co/p/651e677e-3c8e-422b-b0eb-07235c973d3e/tools.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a> will run a rudimentary but complete speed test on any url you provide</li><li><a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTMetrix</a> will run a 3-pass test (and have a slightly less friendly UI). A 3-pass test will help to average out temperamental differences in your server, browser, or testing suite.</li></ul><h3 id="browser-tools">Browser Tools</h3><p>You can run your own tests via your browser's "Inspect"/"Dev Tools" mode. In almost every browser, you can right click anywhere on a page and select the <code>Inspect Element</code> option, or go to the menu and select Develop/Developer and open the <code>Web Inspector</code> mode (different browsers use different names).</p><p>The first test to run is in the <code>Network</code> tab in your Dev Tools.</p><figure><img src="https://romandesign.co/content/images/2021/03/ximage.png.pagespeed.ic.bZCYluizye.png"></figure><p>Make sure to disable cache when you test, and then refresh the page to run the test.</p><p>If you're working with Chrome, you can also use the <code>Lighthouse</code> tab for a more in-depth test:</p><figure><img src="https://romandesign.co/content/images/2021/03/ximage-1.png.pagespeed.ic.89VVvWmNVT.png"></figure><p>Select all of them and test on mobile for the best report. </p><hr><h2 id="what-causes-performance-issues"><u>What Causes Performance Issues?</u></h2><p>In general, the biggest site speed/performance offenders on sites tends to be:</p><ul><li>Images</li><li>Render-blocking javascript and CSS</li><li>Fonts</li><li>Caching</li></ul><p>... in that order. The reasons for this are:</p><ul><li><em>Images</em><br>These tend to be loaded in too big and make the page heavy. If you're downloading a lot of files, you'll slow down the page. </li><li><em>Render-blocking javascript and CSS</em><br>There are a lot of CSS and Javascript issues to talk about, but the biggest issues are those that are render-blocking – aka, they slow down a page from getting to the point of visibility/interactivity. </li><li><em>Fonts</em><br>Similarly, fonts are a problem when they are loaded in unnecessarily... which happens much more often than you think. </li><li><em>Caching</em><br>This essentially means that you don't take advantage of your browser's and server's memory to make things load faster. </li></ul><p>Past that, you're likely looking at deeply technical issues that can't be solved with a standard guide. </p><hr><h2 id="getting-to-80-fixing-images"><u>Getting to 80%: Fixing Images</u></h2><p>Images are easily the number one item that create problems for websites. </p><p>A web-friendly image should be in the range of 50-150kb, <em>max</em>. &nbsp;But most people load in images that are way bigger. They also upload multiple versions of the same image, rather than reusing the first version. They also load physically bigger images than necessary. </p><p>For example, I recently did a site audit for a good friend and images jumped out as easily the number one issue: he was loading in images at 3mb largest, 200-700kb smaller sizes. That's way too big! 6mb of his 7mb page size ended up being unoptimized images.</p><p>So, what can be done? </p><p>Glad you asked. There are a few things to do for image optimization:</p><ul><li>Sizing images correctly</li><li>Compressing images</li><li>Lazy-loading images</li><li>Loading retina images for retina screens</li></ul><h3 id="sizing-images">Sizing Images</h3><p>Sizing images means not bringing in images that are way bigger than they need to be. Going back to my friend's example for a moment: </p><figure><img src="https://romandesign.co/content/images/2021/03/ximage-2.png.pagespeed.ic.q78IHgFiTI.png"></figure><p>No reason this image should be 3k x 3k pixels if it is being loaded in only at 255 &nbsp;x 255 px! </p><p>Quick caveat: sometimes there's a reason why you might have a bigger-than average image. For example, make sure to test the images at your correct mobile breakpoints (an image on mobile may need to take up more space than on a desktop layout), and load in images 2x the size of what they should be, <em>at most</em>. </p><p>Why 2x? Because retina screens (i.e, iphones, new android phones) have high pixel density -- meaning that for an image to look "crisp" it needs to be loaded in at exactly 2x size. Learn more here, I won't bore you with technical details: <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/make-images-retina-ready/">https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/make-images-retina-ready/</a> </p><h3 id="image-compression">Image Compression</h3><p>The second major issue is compression: most images have a bunch of unnecessary information such as metadata, backup color-spaces, file instructions, and layers that add weight to an image without adding end-viewer value. So by removing excess data (and consolidating very-similar-pixels i.e., #000000 and #000001 into just one color), you can drastically bring down image size without losing quality.</p><p>There are a lot of image optimization tools. Some – like ImageMagik – underpin run from the command line and form the backbone of other image optimization services, while other have a friendly drag-and-drop UI. Because this is a mostly non-technical guide, my recommendation is to use &nbsp;<a href="https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression">ShortPixel</a> to optimize every image on your site (you can also download a WordPress plugin to automatically do this for every image, if you're using WordPress). </p><p>There are 3 levels of compression that most off-the-shelf tools will offer: <code>Lossless</code> (<em>only </em>metadata is removed); <code>Glossy</code> (some visual compression, but not enough to make a visual difference), and <code>Lossy</code> (smallest file sizes, but you start to notice visual differences and pixelation). My recommendation is to use Glossy compression because you'll be able to get 60-80% smaller files, without any noticeable loss in quality. </p><h3 id="optimizing-image-loading-technical-">Optimizing Image Loading (Technical)</h3><p>For particularly adventurous optimizers, you can also look into Lazy-Loading images: loading an image only when you scroll over it, or come near it while scrolling, rather than loading every single image in from the start. </p><p>This has a lot of value on image-heavy and 'long' pages. I've used lazy-loading to start loading in images when they are 500 pixels below the fold, and continue this as people scroll down a page. It means you're continually loading files as you scroll, but it creates the perception of fast first-load times because you're only loading in the things someone sees when they first look at your page. </p><p>While there are some plugins for this depending on the site you use, it does require a bit more technical know-how, so I'll leave it for you to do some research on this if it is something you're interested in. </p><p>And remember what I said about retina-sized images? You can use <code>retina.js</code> to ensure you're loading in @2x size images <em>only</em> when needed. Again, this is slightly more technical, but easy enough to implement. </p><p>In summary: size images correctly, save them in sRGB colorspace at 72dpi, and make sure to optimize them -- you'll be 95% there to a faster site. </p><p><em>Side note - </em>Wordpress tends to do their own image compression, which I've found problematic at best, bad at worst. I recommend turning off wordpress's native optimizations, which will ruin your image quality. Quick google search (i.e., <a href="https://www.narga.net/how-to-disable-image-compression-in-wordpress/">https://www.narga.net/how-to-disable-image-compression-in-wordpress/</a>) will tell you how.</p><hr><h2 id="getting-to-90-scripts-fonts-and-cruff-code"><u>Getting to 90%: Scripts, Fonts, and Cruff Code</u></h2><p>Before jumping in here, I want to reiterate that if you handle images correctly, you're 80% of the way there to a faster site. This is the next 10% is a bit more technical, but feel free to read on.</p><h3 id="wordpress-cruff">Wordpress Cruff</h3><p>Wordpress is pretty notorious for loading in a lot of cruff code - visual composer, for example, can slow your site down significantly by loading in a lot of 'just in case' code. So my recommendation is to try out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/">autoptimize</a> as an optimizing plugin. It has a lot of flexibility -- I've used it extensively in deferring script loading and organizing code to speed things up.</p><p>Wordpress plugins are also pretty bad: for the most part, you want to use as few plugins as possible. Most of them are poorly written and will add a lot of unnecessary (or duplicated) code. There are a few plugins that are "okay" -- i.e., anything backend specific like Redis-cache and ShortPixel (see below for redis) that don't affect the front end experience. But others, like social share buttons, will really slow your site down by loading in a lot of tracking pixels, spamware, and simply bad, heavy code.</p><h3 id="render-blocking-scripts">Render Blocking Scripts</h3><p>The biggest things to optimize besides images any render-blocking scripts. Code is loaded and executed in a single-path, sequential order (not multi-threaded aka loading in multiple things at the same time). So if there is a very big file at the start of the load order (usually javascript or a font is the culprit), it will block the rest of the page from loading. </p><p>So you want to find a good balance between loading in the 'skeleton' CSS and content first, and then following everything else to create the illusion that the page has loaded faster. This is called Meaningful Paints, and there are actually a bunch of related metrics around that which you can read here: <a href="https://calibreapp.com/blog/reconsider-tracking-fmp">https://calibreapp.com/blog/reconsider-tracking-fmp</a> ... the TLDR version is that to optimize how fast a page feels, load in the things that don't affect the visual experience last. Autoptimize, mentioned above, is what can help with that: deferred loading. </p><h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3><p>Fonts - like images - cause a surprising amount of problems, which is why you should strongly consider what fonts are 'essential' to your experience and remove unnecessary fonts from being loaded. </p><p>The biggest mistakes people make here are:</p><ul><li>To load in all of the weights of a font when you might only need regular and italic</li><li>Loading in extra fonts that look nice, but are very rarely used, and</li><li>Loading in full icon fonts when you only need maybe 10 icons max. </li></ul><p>To figure out your font …</p></div></div>

I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalist: reading James Clear's wonderful <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).
</p>

<p>
As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.
</p>

<p>
I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.
</p>

<p>
This is all very experimental<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and as mentioned on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/">reddit</a> (follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/">here</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705">twitter</a>, the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">TestFlight</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2><p>Lately I've been programming both in Go and Rust -- among other languages like Python, Erlang, or
Bash (and, yes, Bash is a programming language) -- thus those acquainted with Rust will observe that
the title is a hint to one of Rust's major selling points, that of zero cost abstractions, namely
that you don't pay for what you don't actually use (right now, but you might use in the future).</p><p>However, although the issue I'm about to describe is present to some extent in any programming
language -- from Bash (again, yes, Bash is a programming language, although a very bad one), to
Java, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, and even Rust -- unfortunately in Go it is made even worse by not having
a suitable workaround.</p><p>The issue might seem minor, and usually it is so, especially given that only lately when I've
focused on the start-up performance of one of my tools have I stumbled upon this issue. And in fact
the first time I tackled it was with the overhead introduced by loading some Python modules I didn't
always use.</p><p>But, with Python I expected this to be an issue, and I knew immediately where to look. With Go less
so, and I've done quite a bit of digging to find the problem (but unfortunately no usable
solution)...</p><h2 id="what-are-initializers">What are "initializers"?</h2><p>Starting with Go,
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#init">package initializers</a>
are nothing more than anonymous functions, tagged <code>init</code>, without any arguments, that are executed (in
quite a
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Package_initialization">specific order</a>)
before the <code>main</code> function of an executable. (I say "anonymous" and "tagged" because inside the same file you
can have many such initializers, and they can't be called explicitly from anywhere.) Obviously these are
meant for libraries and not executables (which can just call that code at the beginning of <code>main</code>).</p><p>What can you do within these initializers? Basically anything you can in a normal function, just
that it executes before <code>main</code>. For example a library could initialize some private (but global)
variables with something that requires a bit of code to figure out, like configuration files,
runtime parameters, credentials, or loading previously computed and then cached data, etc.</p><p>Needless to say, the unwritten (but unenforced) rule of these initializers is that they should be
short and not stall the start-up needlessly... (Especially since Go has lightweight go-routines that
could do the initialization in the background if more effort is required...)</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>package somePackage

var someGlobalA someTypeA
var someGlobalB someTypeB

func init () {
    // do some non-trivial, but quick, computation...
    someGlobalA = ...
    someGlobalB = ...
}
</code></pre><p>However, this feature is not specific to Go, and as mentioned all programming languages have some
sort of package / module / library initializers:</p><ul><li>Java has
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.7">class static initializers</a>,
again with a
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.4">rigid execution order</a>;</li><li>Python, Ruby, NodeJS, and perhaps most similar interpreted languages, just allow arbitrary code
to be executed at the top-level of a module's body; for example as described
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html">here for Python</a>,
this code will be executed in the same order the modules are being loaded (first dependencies
then dependents, and so on recursively);</li><li>even Erlang, a functional programming language at heart, has something similar as part of OTP
(Erlang's runtime platform);</li><li>and I'm certain that by now -- in 2 AP, as in second "anno pandemus", or for those reading in the
past the year 2021 AD in the future -- C++ already has found a way to provide weapons of mass
feet shooting for its developers;</li><li>(I would bet the same goes for C# and the entire .NET ecosystem;)</li></ul><p>Regarding the other camp:</p><ul><li>Rust, by design, makes sure that
<a href="https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#can-i-run-code-before-main">there is no life before main</a>;</li><li>(from what I know) C (the language) doesn't also provide a way to have non constant
static initializers;</li><li>moreover, many C-based libraries (and some well-written C++ ones) provide the user with a
<code>somelib_init</code> function that must be called before any other calls to their functions;</li><li>although GCC (and perhaps many other C compilers and runtimes) do provide a way to have
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html">initialization functions</a>
(or constructors as they are called); however their main use-case seems to support languages
that do require them;</li><li>(I would also bet, but not a lot, that more functional languages like Haskel, and certainly
Scheme implementations of R7RS, are strict about this;)</li></ul><h3 id="but-wait-as-the-commercial-says-there-is-more">But wait, (as the commercial says), there is more...</h3><p>Most of the languages listed above, not only allow you to provide some means to execute arbitrary
code (in fact that feature is more on the advanced developers side), but also provide the developer
a way to initialize global variables with arbitrary expressions.</p><p>Again, in Go, for example:</p><pre><code>package somePackage

var someGlobalC someTypeC = newSomeC ()

func newSomeC () someTypeC {
    // do some non-trivial, but quick, computation...
    return ...
}
</code></pre><p>Thus, what initially might just seem as some harmless variable initialization, in fact could be a
call to a slow grinding wheel computing the answer to the ultimate question (to which we all know
the answer is usually 43 due to a one-off bug)...</p><h3 id="a-slight-detour-about-finalizers">A slight detour about "finalizers"</h3><p>Although many languages provide "initializers", few provide "finalizers", as in code that is assured
to be run before a program finishes.</p><p>The POSIX standard provides
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/atexit.3.html">atexit(3)</a>,
GCC does seem to also provide a way to register "destructors", some languages even expose some
wrappers for it, but none seem to provide some actual facility that are tailored for this specific
use-case... Granted some languages do provide some hooks that trigger when a "scope" finishes -- for
example we have <code>defer</code> in Go, and destructors for Rust and C++ -- however these are meant with
another use-case in mind.</p><p>Strange... Perhaps that's why many servers don't provide a clean way to be shutdown, and instead one
has to clobber them with a definitive <code>SIGKILL</code> after asking nicely in vain with <code>SIGTERM</code>, <code>SIGINT</code>
and other SIG-perhaps-this-works signals...</p><p>Also, as a funny irony, for one application in Rust I encountered a situation where calling the
finalizers (i.e. destructors) took quite some time compared to the total execution time, and I had
to resort to forcibly exiting the process without waiting for Rust to properly finalize.</p><h2 id="so-whats-the-issue">So what's the issue?</h2><p>Seeing that almost every programming language under the sun provides a way to sneak some code to be
executed before <code>main</code>, one would ask why I am complaining about this, and especially why I have
something against how it's implemented in Go?</p><p>Well for starters, Go is not the main culprit. Go doesn't force anyone to use the initializers
features, neither does any other language for that mater.</p><p>Moreover, there is the question of utility: if I <code>import</code> a library doesn't it mean I also intend to
use it? After all Go does an outstanding job of making sure (through compilation errors) that there
are no unused imports.</p><p>And here is where the argument (and especially Go's implementation) starts to show its weakness...</p><p>Imagine for a moment we are building a "do everything within a single statically linked binary"
tool.</p><h3 id="a-side-note-about-single-binary-do-all-tools">A side-note about single-binary do-all tools</h3><p>Why would one want to do this? (That is bundle a set of slightly related tools inside the same
executable.)</p><p>Because it's one of the places where Go really shines, as a systems programming language, especially
today with so many operating systems, let alone Linux and BSD distributions, flavors and
architectures. Thus given how easily I can build an OSX, BSD or even Windows executable from my
Linux, regardless if I use an Intel processor and I target Apple's new M1 ARM processor, and
corroborated with the fact that I don't want to dance the <code>rpm</code> or <code>deb</code> polka (not to speak about
the Windows MSI or OSX DMG baroque dance), I would prefer to just throw one binary for each
supported platform on GitHub's release page and be done with that.</p><p>And it seems this isn't a new or isolated trend, as lots of Go projects ship this way:</p><ul><li>starting with (the C-based)
<a href="https://busybox.net/">Busybox</a>
(that I believe powers at least 75% of all world-wide home and small-business networking
appliances), and its BSD alternative
<a href="https://www.landley.net/toybox/">ToyBox</a>;</li><li>Cloudflare's
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared">cloudflared</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/tree/master/cmd/flarectl">flarectl</a>;</li><li>Netlify's former
<a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlifyctl">netlifyctl</a>;</li><li>open source projects like
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy">Caddy</a>;</li><li>(and I could keep on naming similar tools, written from Python to Erlang;)</li><li>(heck, if I think better, this is exactly what the FlatPack and AppImage projects are selling;)</li></ul><p>What all of these have in common? One (usually statically linked, or self-contained /
self-extracting) binary that can be thrown anywhere on the file-system, and as long as it's in the
<code>$PATH</code>, can easily be used.</p><p>What else do they have in common? Lots of slightly related functionality, which I bet are full of
initializers...</p><h3 id="getting-back-to-our-initializers">Getting back to our initializers...</h3><p>So in this case it seems that even though one imports lots of different libraries, they aren't used
all at the same time; at best one or two major libraries are used to implement a given sub-command.</p><p>However, given how initializers work in Go, that is each initializer for every package is run before
<code>main</code> regardless, all these "small but many" initializers add up and slow the startup process.</p><h3 id="so-you-say-this-is-make-believe-problem">So you say this is "make believe problem"?</h3><p>Well not quite... Let's for a second say that my argument about why I would like to bundle
multiple functionality in the same binary is moot; let's say I pay the cost of using a good tool for
the wrong job. Let's...</p><p>Let us imagine one wants to use the Go built-in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">net/rpc</a>
package, that allows one to easily implement RPC clients and servers over HTTP, plain TCP or UNIX
domain sockets. Now it seems that there are some "debugging" facilities that export some HTML for
the available services -- I don't use this, nor do I have any idea on how they are used, nor can
they be disabled -- and as a consequence in its source code, at line 39 in
<a href="https://golang.org/src/net/rpc/debug.go">debug.go</a>,
there is the following code, which unfortunately, based on my experiments, takes at least 0.5
milliseconds to initialize:</p><pre><code>var debug = template.Must(template.New("RPC debug").Parse(debugText))
</code></pre><p>So to summarize:</p><ul><li>Do I use it? No.</li><li>Can I disable it? No.</li><li>Am I …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>So here you are, you’ve built a tool for the Chrome Web Store and suddenly you’ve been bestowed with a<strong> couple of thousand users across the globe</strong>.</p><p>One question, would be how to monetise such an impressive piece of tech you’ve created.</p><p>If you’ve spent your time on an Android or iOS, the path to monetisation are far easy &amp; a lot simplier. Somehow, however, <strong>Chrome Extensions don’t carry the same weight</strong> in the mind of the user. They are much more inclined to pay for an app or an ongoing service but Chrome Extensions wind up in the realm of “should be free.”</p><p>A lot of chrome extensions are the child of a large product or a global product itself, cases such as Honey, the coupon finder &amp; Grammerly are super giants that don’t really fall into the realm of developer accidently making a tool valuable to thousands.</p><p>There seems to be a vat of extensions floating around the 20k to 50k mark, not been updated since 2015. What do to?</p><p>Rather than give you a list of things<strong> untried or untested with affiliate links attached, let’s run through stories that I know.</strong></p><p>There's a new platform called <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they have built a Chrome Extension billing platform as a direct replacement for the upcoming sunset of the Chrome Web Store Payments.</p><p>Check them out : <a href="https://monetise.so/">https://monetise.so</a></p><p>It’s no secret that Adblock Plus with their ~100 Million global users have profited from the blockage of adverts existing on internet.</p><p>The business model is unique &amp; simple, they allowed certain whitelisted ads through, non-intrusive and Google paid them an undisclosed amount.</p><p>They are not the only ones who do what they do, but they’re very good at it.<br>They aggregate affiliate schemes across the internet and put them into a single JS file for you to plugin to your site. They also built something for Chrome Extensions, after you include in your code, they will start including logos on Google Search Results, like so:</p><figure><img src="https://tillypay.com/blog/content/images/2020/02/1-tf0Kx1jGsc5mmRHPo7VYXA.png"></figure><p>The DJI link is now monetised and everyone is happy, the user who is paying somewhat for the extension, the extension developer but not Google Chrome, understandably.</p><p>This is malvertising, it’s advertising in a malware way of including unwanted code. Even with it’s horrid name, if privacy is not your thing, then there’s very little impacting the end user. The issue comes when you are allowing a third party with that much access to your google searches, maybe not.</p><p>Actually, I do have access to the maths on this:</p><ul><li><strong>50,000 Weekly Users resulted in about €2.2k a month.</strong></li><li>That’s about <strong>4.4 cent per user,</strong> mostly from Tier 1 GEOs (US, UK, FR, DE)</li></ul><p>Google will kick you out if they find this.<br>It's happened time &amp; time again.</p><p>Revolution, is what they called it.<br>A new way to monetise the internet.</p><p>Yes, but no. Firstly, the UX for your end-user sucks balls.<br>Their brand new computer is down to it’s last leg trying to get the you (the developer), $0.0002 per minute of agony.</p><p>Also, I’ve tried this.<br>I had 10k Weekly Users, that turned into about 30 concurrent users on average at any one time.</p><p>I made $16 a month from Coinhive at 25% of his user’s CPU.</p><p>Back to the drawing board.</p><p><em>Freemium</em><br>Popular topic on the lips of SaaS models, provide something a bit more &amp; users are willing to pay for it. The problem you may have is that you product just isn’t worth a cup of coffee a month. On a popular VPN Chrome extension, they managed to get 50k users a month to pay for their premium product out of a user base of 4 million MAU. Their premium product was pretty damn great too.</p><p>Here are some great stories of Chrome Extensions being monetised in this way:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/how-sharing-helpful-knowledge-helped-me-grow-to-2-500-month-ad9b94660e">Weather App</a> - $2.5k MRR</li><li><a href="https://beebs.io/">Beebs</a> - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/from-no-coding-skills-to-50k-downloads-in-two-years-eca7ea8587">$5K MRR</a></li><li>Nighteye, nightmode - <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/night-eye">$2.3k MRR</a></li></ul><p><em>Paid-Only</em><br>Yes, this works well if your product is good enough for the switch.<br>Might be fairly difficult to encourage users to pay for the simple RSS extension you created.</p><p><em>Paywall or not to Paywall</em><br>Paywalling your current userbase guarantees the maximum number of conversions in that time period, everything else is bad news. Chrome extensions have review mechanisms that mean you’ll paywall your userbase &amp; they turn to the review board for revenge. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-hint/akipcefbjlmpbcejgdaopmmidpnjlhnb" rel="noopener nofollow">See here</a>.</p><p>I decided to paywall all the new users but keep the old users free. This way I had 50,000 people who loved &amp; would recommend the extension and a steady stream of newcomers who some (5%) of them would pay a monthly subscription for it.</p><p><strong>The best way to start paywalling is to use <a href="https://monetise.so/">Monetise.so</a>, they are a direct replacement of the Chrome Web Store.</strong></p><p>This could be a possibility for you, I know of a few examples this works well:</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-for-a-cause/gibkoahgjfhphbmeiphbcnhehbfdlcgo?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow">Tab for a Cause</a><br>They have a new tab page with an advert on it, they donate roughly ~30% of their Gross Revenue to charities.</p><p>Total Q1 2019 Revenue: <strong>$139,395.93.</strong><br>$0.25 per user per month, not bad at all.</p><p>They have, what you probably don’t is a lot of coverage being at the new tab page of every single user.</p><p><a href="http://ecosia.org/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Ecosi</strong></a>a is the tree planting search engine, uses its advert revenue into planting trees across the planet. It’s difficult to quantify as they have many platforms.<br>However, diverting your user-base to a search engine is quite a profitable business, the difficulty is getting them there in the first place.</p><p>Unsure on the user numbers, but they made €2.5M in the last reported month with 10 million users. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/norton-safe-search/gkjahlcnbjiangkneanonnndppicobbd?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Norton Safe Search</strong></a> is an example of a company forcefully changing your search engine for monetary gain, there is absolutely zero benefit to an anti-virus search engine, none.</p><p>You have to be a position where changing search or implementing adverts seems legitimate. Google will quickly remove your extension if you do that.</p><p>Thee value of switching user for these Bing-copycat search engines is about €0.80 per weekly user for a tier 1 geo; really not bad going.</p><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-5-your-favorite-web/haafibkemckmbknhfkiiniobjpgkebko?hl=de&amp;" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Panda</strong></a> offer chrome extension, 60K weekly users that probably wittles down to 10k MAU. Squarespace reportedly pay $4k a month for a spot.</p><p>Don’t do this.<br>Like <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/12/17/chrome-avast-extensions-removed/" rel="noopener nofollow">Avast have done</a>, they collected clickstream data to feed their other suspicously data rich company, <a href="https://www.jumpshot.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumpshot</a>.<br>Like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/evidon-sells-ghostery-data-to-advertisers-2013-6?r=DE&amp;IR=T" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghostery</a> have done.</p><p>Both Firefox &amp; Chrome will kick you out even at a whiff of this.<br>Good money, undoubtedly but I have no numbers.<br>I was recently told of a 6 digit figure for access to search data with Jumpshot.</p><p>Hola Unblocker allow for users to access geo-blocked content, but at a cost.<br>Your computer becomes a part of the appropriately named, <a href="https://luminati.io/" rel="noopener nofollow">Luminati</a> network.<br>They then sell your connection to the highest bidder and all sorts can run through the computer. It makes unblocking a doddle. With access to apparently 40M residential IPs, it’s pretty massive and <a href="https://luminati.io/static/IPPN-analysis-2019.pdf?md5=3109015-85e418b7" rel="noopener nofollow">making $40M a year.</a></p><p>If you don't understand residential proxies, here's a<a href="https://proxyscraper.io/what-is-a-residential-proxy/"> little guide.</a></p><p>Lastly, donations. I only really have non-quantitative information on donations for Chrome Extensions.</p><p>They don’t work as well as they should, you might gather bits &amp; pieces of cash here and there but it’s the lowest form of per user donation, you are not wikipedia or the Guardian, remember that.</p><p>If you’ve gathered enough mass and provide a valuable time/money/effort savings product, then I’d opt for the Premium tier.<br>If you can place adverts or have an opportunity to, try that out.<br>Ultimately, get to know your users and get a feel for what fits well.</p><p>Anything untoward is unsustainable.<br>Good luck.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summary: I believe that small websites are compelling aesthetically, but are also important to help us resist selling our souls to large tech companies. In this essay I present a vision for the “small web” as well as the small software and architectures that power it. Also, a bonus rant about microservices.</p>

  <p><strong>Go to:</strong> <a href="#small-software">Software</a> | <a href="#small-websites">Web</a> | <a href="#emphasize-server-side-not-javascript">Server-side</a> | <a href="#static-sites-and-site-generators">Static sites</a> | <a href="#fewer-dependencies">Dependencies</a> | <a href="#small-analytics">Analytics</a> | <a href="#small-architectures-not-microservices">Microservices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>About fifteen years ago, I read E. F. Schumacher’s <em>Small is Beautiful</em> and, despite not being interested in economics, I was moved by its message. Perhaps even more, I loved the terse poetry of the book’s title – it resonated with my frugal upbringing and my own aesthetic.</p>

<p>I think it’s time for a version of that book about technology, with a chapter on web development: <em>The Small Web is Beautiful: A Study of Web Development as if People Mattered.</em> Until someone writes that, this essay will have to do.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of this: first, <strong>small teams and companies</strong>. I’m not going to talk much about that here, but <a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Basecamp</a> and many others have. What I’m going to focus on in this essay is <strong>small websites and architectures</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m not the first to talk about the “small web”, but, somewhat surprisingly, only a few people have discussed it using that term. Here are the main web pages I can find that do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Rediscovering the Small Web</a> by Parimal Satyal: a fabulous article about the joy of small, independent (and sometimes retro) websites in contrast to the “commercial web”.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">What is the Small Web?</a>, by Aral Balkan of the Small Technology Foundation: more of a manifesto against the surveillance of Big Tech than something concrete, but still interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why aim small in this era of fast computers with plenty of RAM? A number of reasons, but the ones that are most important to me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fewer moving parts. It’s easier to create more robust systems and to fix things when they do go wrong.</li>
  <li>Small software is faster. Fewer bits to download and clog your computer’s memory.</li>
  <li>Reduced power consumption. This is important on a “save the planet” scale, but also on the very local scale of increasing the battery life of your phone and laptop.</li>
  <li>The light, frugal aesthetic. That’s personal, I know, but as you’ll see, I’m not alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s dive in. I want to cover a bunch of different angles, each with its own subheading.</p>

<h2 id="small-software">Small software</h2>

<p>If we’re going to talk about a small web, we need to start with small <em>software</em>.</p>

<p>As a teen, I learned to program using x86 assembly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> – perhaps odd choices, but my dad was heavily into Forth, and I loved how the language was so simple I could write <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/third">my own bootstrapped compiler</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of career, I started as an embedded programmer – not as in “embedded Linux” but as in microcontrollers where 16KB of RAM was generous. My current laptop has 16GB of RAM, and that’s not a lot by today’s standards. We were building IP-networked products with <em>one millionth</em> the amount of RAM. Those kinds of micros are as cheap as chips (ahem), and still widely used for small electronic devices, sensors, internet-of-things products, and so on.</p>

<p>You have to think about every byte, compile with size optimizations enabled, and reuse buffers. It’s a very different thing from modern web development, where a JavaScript app compiles “down” to a 1MB bundle, or a single Python object header is 16 bytes before you’ve even got any data, or a Go hello-world binary is 2MB even before you’ve added any real code.</p>

<p>How do you create small programs? I think the main thing is that you have to <em>care about size</em>, and most of us don’t think we have time for that. Apart from embedded development, there’s an entire programming subculture called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> that cares about this. They have competitions for the smallest 4KB demos: who can pack the most graphical punch into 4096 bytes of executable. That’s smaller than many favicons! (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0vBmiTr6o">Elevated</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs">cdak</a> are two of the highest-rated 4K demos.) Many demosceners go on to become game developers.</p>

<p>It’s not just about executable size … when you’re developing your next command line tool, if you use Go or Rust or even C, your program will be much faster, smaller, and use less memory than a Python or Java equivalent. And easier to install. If you don’t understand why, please do learn. (It’s out of scope for this essay, but to summarize: Go, Rust, and C compile to ready-to-execute machine code, don’t carry around a virtual machine, and don’t have memory overhead for objects like integers.)</p>

<p>But why not apply some of the same principles to web development? In the web world, I think the main trick is to be careful what dependencies you include, and also what dependencies <em>they</em> pull in. In short, know <code>node_modules</code> – or maybe better, <em>no</em> <code>node_modules</code>. More about this <a href="#fewer-dependencies">below</a>.</p>

<p>Niklaus Wirth of Pascal fame wrote a famous paper in 1995 called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software [PDF]</a>. His take is that “a primary cause for the complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want”, and “when a system’s power is measured by the number of its features, quantity becomes more important than quality”. He goes on to describe Oberon, a computer language (which reminds me of Go in several ways) and an operating system that he believes helps solve the complexity problem. Definitely wirth a read!</p>

<p>I’ve been mulling over this for a number of years – back in 2008 I wrote a sarcastic dig at how bloated Adobe Reader had become: <a href="https://blog.brush.co.nz/2008/07/adobe-reader-9/">Thank you, Adobe Reader 9!</a> It was a 33MB download and required 220MB of hard drive space even in 2008 (it’s now a 150MB download, and I don’t know how much hard drive space it requires, because I don’t install it these days).</p>

<p>But instead of just complaining, how do we actually solve this problem? Concretely, I think we need to start doing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care about size: this sounds obvious, but things only change when people think they’re important.</li>
  <li>Measure: both your executable’s size, and your program’s memory usage. You may want to measure over time, and make it a blocking issue if the measurements grow more than <em>x</em>% in a release. Or you could hold a memory-reduction sprint every so often.</li>
  <li>Language: choose a backend language that has a chance, for example Rust, C or C++, or for servers, Go. These languages aren’t right for everything (like data transformation scripts), but they produce small executables, and they’re good for CLIs and desktop apps.</li>
  <li>Remove: cut down your feature set. Aim for a small number of high-quality features. My car can’t fly or float, and that’s okay – it drives well.</li>
  <li>Say no to new features: unless they really fit your philosophy, or add more than they cost over the lifetime of your project.</li>
  <li>Dependencies: understand the size and complexity of each dependency you pull in. Use only built-in libraries if you can.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="small-websites">Small websites</h2>

<p>I’m glad there’s a growing number of people interested in small websites.</p>

<p>A few months ago there was a sequence of posts to Hacker News about various “clubs” you could post your small website on: the <a href="https://1mb.club/">1MB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25151773">comments</a>), <a href="https://512kb.club/">512KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25450451">comments</a>), <a href="https://250kb.club/">250KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25176663">comments</a>), and even the <a href="https://10kbclub.com/">10KB Club</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25556860">comments</a>). I think those are a fun indicator of renewed interested in minimalism, but I will say that raw size isn’t enough – a 2KB site with no real content isn’t much good, and a page with 512KB of very slow JavaScript is worse than a snappy site with 4MB of well-chosen images.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite small websites are:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a>: I personally like the minimalist, almost brutalist design, but I love its lightness even more. I just downloaded the home page, and loading all resources transfers only 21KB (61KB uncompressed). Even pages with huge comment threads only transfer about 100KB of compressed data, and load quickly. Reddit has become such a bloated mess in comparison. Hacker News, never change!</p>

<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a>: a similar news-and-voting site, with slightly more “modern” styling. It uses some JavaScript and profile icons, but it’s still clean and fast, and the total transfer size for the homepage is only 102KB. You just don’t need megabytes to make a good website.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourcehut.org/">Sourcehut</a>: I like the concept behind Drew DeVault’s business, but I love how small and anti-fluff the website is. He has set up a mini-site called the <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">Software Forge Performance Index</a> that tracks size and browser performance of the prominent source code websites – Sourcehut is far and away the lightest and fastest. Even his homepage is only 81KB, including several screenshot thumbnails.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>: not only is SQLite a small, powerful SQL database engine, the website is fantastically small and content-rich. Even their 7000-word <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html">page about testing</a> is only 70KB. How do they do this? It’s not magic: focus on high-quality textual content, minimal CSS, no JavaScript, and very few images (a small logo and some SVGs).</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN</a>: I’m a little biased, because I’ve written <a href="https://lwn.net/Archives/GuestIndex/#Hoyt_Ben">articles</a> for them, but they’re an excellent website for Linux and programming news. Extremely high-quality technical content (and a high bar for authors). They’re definitely niche, and have a “we focus on quality content, not updating our CSS every year” kind of look – they’ve been putting out great content for 23 years! Their homepage only downloads 44KB (90KB uncompressed).</p>

<p><a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>: this is one of the more hardcore examples. His inline CSS is only about 200 bytes (the pages are basically unstyled), and his HTML source code doesn’t use any linefeed characters. Kind of a fun point, although then he goes on to load 20KB of Google Analytics JavaScript…</p>

<p>As a friend pointed out, those websites have something of an “anti-aesthetic aesthetic”. I confess to not minding that at all, but on the other hand, small doesn’t have to mean ugly. More and more personal blogs and websites have adopted a small web approach but are more typographically appealing:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I started my career building WordPress sites for clients, and at the time, it was one of the best things I could have been working on. That was eight years ago and a lot has changed including my preferred tech stack. </p>



<p>For building applications, I like to use a “modern” tech stack (<a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" rel="noopener">Express.js</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="noopener">Node</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a>). Sexy, new technology is fun to work with and makes me feel smart. However, I see a lot of folks in the dev community speak poorly about WordPress, and I just don’t get it.</p>



<h2>Why I Continue to Use WordPress</h2>



<p>It’s incredibly quick and easy to build and re-build a website. I redesigned this site in 2 days. The available drag-and-drop page builders are great and allowed me to completely change everything without touching a single line of code.</p>



<p>It just works. I don’t need to jump through hoops for the installation process, or pore over archaic documentation sites. Plugins and themes need upgrades, but it’s not like managing a giant list of NPM dependencies, trying to get the right versions so the project will run. There is so much value that comes from things just working as advertised.</p>



<p>It solves so many problems that could otherwise be a bit of a pain: user accounts, content management, forms submissions, media hosting and management, SEO, form submissions, integrating payments, eCommerce. It’s all either built in, or easily solved with a plugin.</p>



<p>The ecosystem is amazing. Every day, there are tens of thousands of developers working to make <strong>my WordPress website</strong> even better without me needing to do anything.</p>



<p>There are WordPress developers everywhere which is good if you have questions or need help. It also adds to the competition if you are a WordPress developer yourself.</p>



<p>It makes owning a website super affordable. The software itself is free, and most sites can get by just fine with a $5/month hosting account as long as you don’t use a million poorly developed plugins.</p>



<p>Building a site with WordPress means I can hand it over to non-technical team members and they can take it from there. I don’t have to be bothered to make every little typo fix. It saves me a ton of time to do dev work for things I actually want to work on.</p>



<p>The single best thing that WordPress has done for me is free up my time to focus on the main purpose of my website which is to write. I don’t get distracted with tech stack decisions or little bug fixes, it just works.</p>



<h2>Things I Don’t Love About WordPress</h2>



<p>Maintenance. With WordPress, you have to keep updated versions of the core software, the theme, and any plugins you have installed (which can be many). This </p>



<p>It’s definitely not sexy development. You often have to do things the “WordPress way”. I got really good at writing HTML and CSS with WordPress, but there were a lot of other things I had to learn that did not transfer to non-WordPress work.</p>



<p>WordPress is free, but you still need to host it somewhere. When compared that to many of the alternative static site builders and hosts, you could be looking at WordPress costing money, and a static site being free. I’ve thought about switching for these reasons, but I never do because WordPress hosting can cost as little as $3 a month, and I really am not interested in the amount of work and upkeep I would need to make for a static site. That work is a bigger cost for me than my hosting bill.</p>



<p>Some folks complain about performance. This may or may not be true. If you use a lot of bad plugins or themes, then your WordPress site will likely be slow. It will probably also be slower than a static website, but that doesn’t make it slow. My site runs on WordPress and is plenty fast for my needs.</p>



<h2>Tips for using WordPress</h2>



<p>Before you get started working on your WordPress site, make sure you have access to the hosting account, the server files (FTP), and the database. That way, if something goes wrong, you will be able to fix it.</p>



<p>Never make changes using the built in theme editor. Never!</p>



<p>You should always have scheduled backups running on your site in case something goes wrong. Most hosting providers offer some sort of backup service. Take the time at the beginning to make sure it’s running. Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.</p>



<p>Here’s a list with a lot of some of my favorite WordPress tools.</p>



<ul><li>Theme: <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/blocksy/" rel="noopener">Blocksy</a></li><li>Page builder: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/" rel="noopener">Elementor</a></li><li>Forms: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/forminator/" rel="noopener">Forminator</a></li><li>Performance: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cloudflare-page-cache/" rel="noopener">WP Cloudflare Super Page Cache</a></li><li>Performance: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/" rel="noopener">WP-Optimize – Clean, Compress, Cache</a></li><li>Performance: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" rel="noopener">EWWW Image Optimizer</a></li><li>SEO: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/" rel="noopener">Rank Math SEO</a></li><li>Analytics: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ga-in/" rel="noopener">GAinWP Google Analytics Integration for WordPress</a></li><li>Security: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/" rel="noopener">All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall</a></li><li>Backups: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpvivid-backuprestore/" rel="noopener">WPvivid Backup Plugin</a></li><li>Antispam: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/antispam-bee/" rel="noopener">Antispam Bee</a></li><li>Developer tool: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/" rel="noopener">Advanced Custom Fields</a></li><li>Developer tool: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wck-custom-fields-and-custom-post-types-creator/" rel="noopener">Custom Post Types and Custom Fields creator</a></li><li>Developer tool: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/" rel="noopener">Query Monitor</a></li><li>Misc: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/" rel="noopener">Code Snippets</a></li><li>Misc: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/" rel="noopener">Safe SVG</a></li><li>Misc: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/" rel="noopener">Really Simple SSL</a></li><li>Migration: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/" rel="noopener">All-in-One WP Migration</a></li><li>Migration: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-search-replace/" rel="noopener">Better Search Replace</a></li><li>Local development: <a href="https://localwp.com/" rel="noopener">Local</a></li></ul>



<p>You can view all of my favorites on <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stegosource/#content-favorites" rel="noopener">my WordPress profile page</a>.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>WordPress is great for folks that just want to build a basic website that’s easy to make changes to. If you’re good with design and don’t want to muck about with too much coding, the drag and drop page builder is a blessing.</p>



<p>If you are a developer there might be other cooler, more modern technology stacks to work with, but that doesn’t mean you should hate WordPress. It has allowed a lot of folks to leave their full time jobs to pursue their own clients. If that’s something you might fancy, it’s worth giving it a go.</p>



<p>Finally, for the folks that like to hate on WordPress because that’s the ‘cool’ thing to do, just stop. It may not be the best tool for every single thing, but it does what it does really well. There is a reason it powers 1 in every 3 websites, including the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/" rel="noopener">White House</a> website.</p>



<p>If you have thoughts on this that you’d like to share, <a href="https://twitter.com/Stegosource" rel="noopener">ping me on Twitter</a>. I would also appreciate if you <a href="https://twitter.com/share?via=Stegosource" rel="noopener">share it</a>, or <a href="https://austingil.com/newsletter/">sign up for my newsletter</a> if you enjoyed this content.</p>

<center><b><span size="+4">HECnet - The hobbyist DECnet network.</span></b></center>
<span size="+2">What is HECnet?</span>
<p>HECnet is a DECnet that connects different people who play around with
  different machines that have the DECnet protocol suite.
  The network should not be regarded as a serious
networking setup, nor should it be expected to work 24/7. It's a hobby
project between people who think it's fun to create a DECnet network.
<br>HECnet is basically a DECnet phase IV network. Currently, the main
router is a PDP-11 running RSX-11M-PLUS. The machine is located in Uppsala,
Sweden.
<br>The connectivity between nodes can be anything that works. The current
connectivity is with an ethernet bridge between sites, DECnet over IP using
Multinet on VMS or RSX, and DECnet over IP on Cisco. Other solutions that
have been used are a virtual serial async. connection talking DDCMP. Other possibilities
are GRE and DECnet over IP.
</p><p><span size="+2">How do I get connected?</span>
</p><p>In order to connect to HECnet, you need to talk with the resposible
person (currently that is <a href="http://www.update.uu.se/~bqt/">Johnny
Billquist</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:bqt@update.uu.se">bqt@update.uu.se</a>&gt;)
about allocating a node name and number. The node names in DECnet phase
IV must be unique within the whole network, so this have to be coordinated.
(Well, technically, you can have local node names defined for machines
at every node in DECnet, but that isn't much fun, is it?)
Secondly, you need a node number. What number depends on where you get
connected.
<br>After that, you need to set up a connection to whatever DECnet router
you should be connected to. How this is done depends on what kind of connection
you will have.
<br>An ethernet bridge will require a separate Unix machine on the same
ethernet segment as your DECnet machines, which then bridges your
ethernet with the rest of HECnet. This is not a full bridge, but only
one that transmits packets for DECnet, so the rest of the network is not
compromised.
On this Unix computer, you need to compile, configure and run the ethernet
bridge program, which can be found <a href="http://www.update.uu.se/~bqt/bridge.tar">&gt;&gt;here&lt;&lt;</a>.
The configuration requires that you talk with someone else running
the bridge, and agreeing on some parameters for the bridge. You should
probably join the HECnet mailing list at this stage before expecting
things to start working.
</p><p><span size="+2">More information?</span>
</p><p>If you want more information, you can write a mail to <a href="http://www.update.uu.se/~bqt/">Johnny
Billquist</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:bqt@update.uu.se">bqt@update.uu.se</a>&gt;
and ask about whatever you want to know. There is also a mailing list,
&lt;<a href="mailto:hecnet@update.uu.se">hecnet@update.uu.se</a>&gt; for discussions
about HECnet. To join you write to &lt;<a href="mailto:majordomo@update.uu.se">majordomo@update.uu.se</a>&gt;,
and the body of the mail should contain "subscribe hecnet" in it.
</p><p><span size="+2">What does HECnet mean?</span>
</p><p>Well, we had problems coming up with a good name, and just for the heck
of it, it was named HECnet (that is also pretty close in sounding to DECnet).
</p><p><span size="+2">Useful links:</span>
</p><p>Here is a short list of links that people might enjoy:

      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

																										<p>Advancements in safety software installed onboard military fighter jets have led to systems that are being credited with saving the lives of nearly one dozen fighter pilots and preventing the loss of their aircraft in recent years.</p>

<p>A challenge encountered by fighter pilots maneuvering increasingly powerful planes capable&nbsp;of accelerating to Mach 2 and beyond is avoiding blacking out at the controls. While a relatively infrequent occurrence, it does happen, particularly during training missions. The current generation of F-16 Fighting Falcons and F-35 Lightning IIs has been receiving upgrades to AI-driven software that detects impending ground collisions if a pilot blacks out, taking over control of the aircraft and returning it to a safe heading. This is an admirable advancement in terms of safety, but ironically, the technology driving this software may, before very long, largely eliminate the need for the very pilots it was designed to save.</p>

<h2><b>BACKGROUND: Life-Saving Technology</b></h2>
<p>When pilots experience too much gravitational force during high-speed maneuvers they can succumb to a condition known as&nbsp;G-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC. This is characterized by a tendency for the pilot’s blood to flow toward their extremities and away from their brains, which may result in fainting. There are exercises pilots practice to prevent this from happening and modern flight suits are designed to mitigate the effect as well, but both have their limits.</p>

<p>Just last year, two F-16 pilots flying over a test range in Nevada experienced G-LOC events, losing consciousness. In both instances, an onboard system took over control of the planes, righted them in a stable flight configuration and prevented the planes from impacting the ground. A safety review after each incident concluded that both planes would almost certainly have crashed had the software not intervened.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>The software that saved the pilots and planes was developed by Lockheed Martin, the same company that manufactures both the F-16 and the F-35. It’s named the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, or AGCAS. The technology is not installed in all combat aircraft yet, but will likely eventually be ubiquitous among our fleets of fighter craft.</p>


<h2><b>ANALYSIS: IS OUR TECHNOLOGY OUTGROWING THE NEED FOR PILOTS?</b></h2>
<p>While the fighter pilots in our combat aircraft are safer today, they’re not nearly as safe as a new generation of pilots who are currently fighting alongside them but doing it from the other side of the world. New generations of <a href="https://thedebrief.org/trump-signs-order-on-threats-posed-by-unmanned-aircraft-systems/">Unmanned Aeriel&nbsp;Vehicles (UAVs)</a>, commonly referred to as drones, have been increasingly taking on combat duties traditionally handled by human pilots. Some of the most popular with many militaries around the world are the&nbsp;General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc (GA-ASI) MQ-9 series Reapers and SeaGuardians, among others.</p>

<p>These UAVs can be piloted in real-time by pilots stationed inside of control centers located in Nevada and on other military bases far from the battlefield. When conditions require it, artificial intelligence systems can take over and complete missions, using AI systems even more complex and durable than the AGCAS software currently saving the lives of pilots.</p>

<p>The range of missions that can be executed by these UAVs has gone well beyond simply arming them with cannons and smart bombs to take out specific targets. One class of MQ-9s <a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/ga-asi-demos-asw-capability-for-reaperseaguardian-uass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was recently approved</a> for conducting autonomous anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations for the Navy, demonstrating the ability to deploy sonobuoys&nbsp;into the ocean and sending target data back to its pilot in Nevada. More recently, the&nbsp;Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk has been <a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/usaf-chief-of-staff-sees-agility-prime-aircraft-fulfilling-logistics-missions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking on logistics and intelligence duty</a> missions, once the province of planes like the U-2.</p>

<h2><b>THEY CAN’T REALLY REPLACE HUMAN Fighter PILOTS, RIGHT?</b></h2>
<p>The reality is that aircraft have been evolving and getting “smarter” along with many other avenues of technology, from nearly the moment of their inception. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14702436.2019.1676156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2019 research paper</a>published in the journal <i>Defence Studies</i>, Dr.&nbsp;Arash Heydarian Pashakhanlou noted that barely a decade after the Wright Brothers’ famous flight at Kittyhawk, the first autopilot had been developed, capable of keeping a plane at a steady altitude, course, and speed. In the 21st century, the author notes, the autopilot systems in commercial airliners are actually better and more reliable than the humans in the cockpit. Some of the newer versions are actually more reliable for landings and takeoffs, not just maintaining course once the craft reaches cruising altitude.</p>

<p>Obviously, the challenges of flying a fighter jet in combat far exceed those arising in a normal commercial flight between two United States hubs. But that doesn’t mean that the challenges are beyond the reach of current automated piloting systems, assuming the machines haven’t already surpassed the master. Particularly when you consider that the most complicated UAV are still being directly controlled by human pilots at a distance with some AI thrown in as a backstop, human pilots in a craft’s cockpit may already be largely redundant in the latest generations of warfighting aircraft.</p>

<figure id="attachment_3670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3670"><img src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/F-35-Sgt.-Katerina-Slivinske-e1614590721394.jpg" alt="fighter pilots" width="760" height="543" data-src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/F-35-Sgt.-Katerina-Slivinske-e1614590721394.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3670">(Credit: USAF/Public Domain)</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Compounding the problem is the fact that the military is facing <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/02/18/air-force-misses-new-pilot-goal-again-service-pushes-revolutionize-training.html">recurring shortages</a> of pilots. Training a military pilot and putting them into service is a time-consuming and expensive process. But many of them leave the military after their minimum term of service is up, taking lucrative jobs in the commercial sector. This has very likely been one of the factors driving the push to advance the technology of pilotless aircraft.</p>

<h2><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the question we should be asking ourselves now is not one of <i>when</i> the technology will reach a point where human pilots are no longer needed onboard. We appear to already be there, or we will be when enough of the latest generation of aircraft can be put into service. The real question is what’s holding us back. For the majority of most commercial flights these days, the human pilots in the cockpit are mostly there as passengers except during takeoff and landing unless something anomalous takes place in mid-flight. The technology is already with us and should only continue to improve.</p>

<p>The other advantages to UAVs, particularly for the military, should be obvious even to the layman. Removing people from a warfighting aircraft means you can also remove all of the support systems that serve no purpose other than to keep the human(s) alive. There is no need for ejection seats – or any seats for that matter – or pressurization and oxygen to keep them breathing. Windows, always a weak point in the airframe’s design, are no longer needed since the remote pilot “sees” the environment through sensors. And if one of these drones does go down, you don’t have to send someone to present a flag at the funeral of the pilot.</p>

<p>Recent advances in aviation technology, particularly in the military, have been stunning. Whether for use in peace or wartime, we may be in the process of relegating human pilots to small, leisure-craft or flying extremely complex emergency rescue operations. That would likely be very hard for some of us to wrap our heads around and adjust to. There’s always been something both romantic and heroic about fighter pilots, the brave men and women who take to the skies and risk their lives to move people and freight along with fighting our wars.</p>

<p>Who would remember the day in 1918 when Captain Roy Brown shot down&nbsp;Baron Manfred von Richthofen during World War I if both vehicles were being operated by some kid with a keyboard 10,000 miles away? Indeed, this is the brave new world we are continuing to plunge towards.</p>

<p>I woke up with a nice idea of how I’d use statistics and optimization to improve the precision when measuring pollutants by taking just the right number of samples. Turns out that sensors, at least those I have, give a fairly stable voltage, making it enough to spend a few milliseconds to take 30 samples per sensor or so to get a very stable value, and you’d get pretty good results with just one sample as well. An example of the distribution when sampling from a sensor (for around a second) can be seen in figure 1.</p>
<p>Not into natural language? <a href="https://github.com/babyfriendlyair/posts-code/tree/main/2021-02-27-for-shits-and-giggles-optimized-sequential-sampling-from-multiple-sensors-arduino">Jump straight to the code!</a></p>
<a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/quite_good_sensor_read.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/quite_good_sensor_read.png"></a>
<p><small>Figure 1. A bar chart of values read from a Winsen ZE25-O3 sensor. The values are narrowly centered around a top.</small>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I still continued with the idea, as it is still a nice little project for practicing some C++ (currently reading <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/tour2.html">A Tour of C++</a>) as well as brushing of some statistics and optimization skills. I’m still hopeful that this can come in handy later for future projects, as so many problems we solve are just other problems in disguise anyway.</p>
<p>The problem at hand is that I want to measure the analog output from sensors. My fear was that it would be unstable, because I’ve seen it happen a few times. However, it appears to not be a big problem, as I generally get a standard deviation of around 0.5. My sensor setup can be seen in figure 2, it consists of sensors for measuring ozone, humidity and temperature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/many_sensors.jpg"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/many_sensors.jpg"></a></p>
<p><small>Figure 2. Picture of sensors, from top left to right bottom: DHT11 (temperature and humidity), MQ131 low concentration (ozone), MQ131 high concentration (ozone) and ZE25-O3 (ozone).</small>
</p>
<p>I wanted to present you with a messy graph of the black MQ131’s analog output. Now when I think about it, perhaps I did see messy data because it was not “burned in” - it is often specified in sensors’ data sheets that the sensor need to be turned on for a few days if it has been unused for long or never used. Nevertheless, by using an appropriate scale for the Y-axis, we can still make it look messy as in figure 3.</p>
<a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_raw_signal_noise.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_raw_signal_noise.png"></a>
<p><small>Figure 3. Voltage varying between samples.</small>
</p>
<p>Rather than the jumpy voltage values in fig. 3, which is likely “noise” rather than true variations in O<sub>3</sub> measurement, we’d prefer something as shown in fig. 4.</p>
<a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_group_by_30_mean.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_group_by_30_mean.png"></a>
<p><small>Figure 4. Same data as in figure 3. but we take the average value for every group of 30 samples and round it.</small>
</p>
<p>In figure 4 we get a completely flat line by simply taking the average of groups of 30 samples and rounding. The idea is that we can get rid of noise in this way by assuming that the ozone concentration is constant (well, that any changes are below our sensor’s resolution) in the time interval we’re working with (eg. 1s).</p>
<p>On one hand, we could just take 30 samples and be fine with that, but on the other hand, it’s more fun and more of a learning experience to try something different. After a bit of thinking, I formulated my problem as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to sample for a fairly short time and get a decent estimate of the real concentration of the gas under investigation. Under the assumption that the sensor does do its job, but is just suffering from some noise in the measurements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “a fairly short time” comes from that I want to capture changes ASAP, because the concentration might change (truth to be told, I’m also impatient when measuring), an example of this is shown in figure 5, where we no longer have one “top”. Not sampling for too long is particularly important for me because I want to measure many things. For a starter, humidity, temperature and ozone, but hopefully will add nitrogen dioxide, particles, VOC and formaldehyde to that. All of this I would do simultaneously in an ideal world, as I want to explorer the relation between different pollutants later. Furthermore, I want the ability to compare multiple sensors that measure the same thing.</p>
<a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_noise_two_tops.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/a2_noise_two_tops.png"></a>
<p><small>Figure 5. Example of what can happen if we measure for too long. The graph has two “tops” quite far from each other.</small>
</p>
<p>To make things easier, I started to see the problem as a statistical problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a true mean for the concentration in a specific time interval (eg. second). How can we model the quality of our estimate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brushing up on some stats skills <span data-cites="sullivan">[1]</span> <span data-cites="milton_arnold">[2]</span> quickly led me to confidence intervals and in particular margin of error. Assuming that all sensors are equally important, we can minimize the sum of the margin of error for all sensors, subject to a time budget (eg. 1 second) with a fixed desired confidence level (eg. 95%).</p>
<p>With all those ideas we can now break down our problem:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a good estimate of the standard deviation for each sensor in a second.</li>
<li>Calculate time to sample, so we can see how many samples we afford with a fixed maximum sampling time.</li>
<li>Formulate optimization problem so some solver can solve it (future challenge might be to solve it ourselves in C++ - might be handy to recalculate from time).</li>
</ol>
<p>The optimization problems will look something like:</p>
<p><br><span>$$
\begin{alignat}{2}
&amp;\!\min_{n_x,\ x \in \text{sensors}}        &amp;\,&amp;   \sum_{x \in \text{sensors}} \frac {s_{x}} {\sqrt{n_{x}}} \\
\\
&amp;\text{subject to} &amp;      &amp; \sum_{x\in\text{sensors}} n_x &lt;= \text{timeBudget} \\
\\
&amp;\rlap{s_x\text{: estimated standard deviation of sensor x}} \\
&amp;\rlap{n_x\text{: nr of samples from sensor x}} \\
\end{alignat}
$$</span><br></p>
<p>Basically, we want to minimize the sum of the margin of error of all sensors. The margin of error is actually given by:</p>
<p><br><span>$$t * \frac s {\sqrt{n}}\\$$</span><br></p>
<p>where the t is a constant given the chosen confidence level (eg. 95%) and degrees of freedom defined by the sample size (you just look it up in a table). As it won’t affect our optimization problem, we can simply drop it.</p>
<p>Solving such an optimization problem is a piece of cake for something like WolframAlpha, so after a bit of <a href="https://github.com/babyfriendlyair/posts-code/blob/main/2021-02-27-for-shits-and-giggles-optimized-sequential-sampling-from-multiple-sensors-arduino/sensor/SamplesPerSensorOptimizer.cpp">coding</a> we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=min+%280.52+%2F+sqrt%28a%29+%2B+0.28+%2F+sqrt%28b%29+%2B+0.51+%2F+sqrt%28c%29%29+s.t.+a+%2B+b+%2B+c+%3C%3D+8606" title="See in WolframAlpha">min (0.52 / sqrt(a) + 0.28 / sqrt(b) + 0.51 / sqrt(c)) s.t. a + b + c &lt;= 8606</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which WolframAlpha responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a, b, c)≈(3252.96, 2141.52, 3211.44)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As expected, we’re asked to sample less from the sensor with the lowest standard deviation. Keep in mind that we get one or more local minima from WolframAlpha. To perhaps make it easier to grasp, consider if we have a lot fewer samples and greater difference in standard deviations. We want to ask three questions to random people out on the street, we happen to know (lucky us!) that they have standard deviations 100, 500 and 2000. We are only allowed to ask 100 questions in total. That would give:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=min+%28100+%2F+sqrt%28a%29+%2B+500+%2F+sqrt%28b%29+%2B+2000+%2F+sqrt%28c%29%29+s.t.+a+%2B+b+%2B+c+%3C%3D+100" title="See in WolframAlpha">min (100 / sqrt(a) + 500 / sqrt(b) + 2000 / sqrt(c)) s.t. a + b + c &lt;= 100</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WolframAlpha kindly finds a local minima at:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(8.85576, 25.8944, 65.2498)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, when walking around on the streets in your beautiful city, you’d ask question one 9 times, question two 26 times and question three 65 times. You’d end up with a summed “margin of error” of roughly 379, as opposed to roughly 452 if you’d split how many times you ask each question evenly. For question one, you’d notice that people tend to answer roughly the same, whereas for question three, you see very different answers. So you feel confident that you know roughly what to expect for question one pretty early, but for question three not so much.</p>
<p>As already pointed out, it turned out that we didn’t need to consider the confidence level. However, we could fix the margin of error and confidence level to something we want (eg. 0.5 with 95% confidence), and calculate number of samples needed for that. This would in fact be easier, as we can simply use algebra to calculate the answer, as opposed to formulating and solving an optimization problem.</p>
<p>But let’s move on to actually using the results now, in its simplest form, we can just do something like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>int</span> samplesToTake[] {<span>3253</span>, <span>2142</span>, <span>3211</span>}<span>;</span></span>

<p>Where samplesToTake is just copy-pasted from WolframAlpha (and rounded).</p>
<p>As expected, given the low standard deviation, the difference is not massive. It is easiest to see for the MQ131 low concentration sensor (you might need to zoom in):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/mq131Black.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/mq131Black.png"></a></p>
<p><small>Figure 6. Graph for measurements with the MQ131 low concentration. It is visible in the upper graph (by second) how the graph is smoother as we take more samples. mq131Black refers to a single sample, avg30Mq131Black is 30 samples and avgMq131Black is 3253 samples. All taken within an interval of a second. In the hourly average the difference is so small you can’t see it.</small>
</p>
<p>As we did sample from multiple sensors almost simultaneously, I can’t really resist looking at the correlation matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/corrMatrix_BER.png"><img src="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/corrMatrix_BER.png"></a></p>
<p><small>Figure 7. Correlation Matrix of all sensors as well as NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> from a Berlin air quality station.</small>
</p>
<p>A pity is that we get a lower correlation between our Winsen ZE25-O3 sensor and Berlin’s NO<sub>2</sub> measurements than in a <a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/en/technology/measuring-no2-with-a-winsen-ze25-o3-ozone-sensor/">previous experiment</a> (0.60 VS 0.47). However, this might be explained by the correlation with temperature, as the <a href="https://www.babyfriendlyair.com/images/en/technology/temp.png">temperature was pretty much rising throughout the whole measurement period</a>. I also have some suspicions that Berlin’s air quality monitoring wasn’t working that well, for instance, it recently reported several hundreds μg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM10 (which is quite a lot, even if sand that blew up from Sahara can explain elevated levels).</p>
<p>Interesting is to see that all sensors had negative correlation with outdoor ozone. I believe this can partly be explained by that ozone negatively correlates with NO<sub>x</sub>, and the sensors are sensitive to NO<sub>x</sub> which is simply dominating. So as O<sub>3</sub> goes down and NO<sub>x</sub> goes up, we get a higher value. We can also see the …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://home.cern/news/news/knowledge-sharing/cern-collaborations-open-new-horizons-cancer-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Next Ion Medical Machine Study (NIMMS)</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;uses CERN particle accelerator technology and expertise to build the next generation of small ion accelerators to treat cancerous tumors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 1996, CERN co-founded the Proton Ion Medical Machine Study (PIMMS) to treat cancer using beams of charged protons and ions to blast tumors. Called hadron therapy, large particle accelerators create either a proton beam or an ion beam that is tight enough to target tumors deep in the body, near sensitive organs, and reduce possible damage to any surrounding tissue. The four hadron therapy centers in Europe providing hadron therapy have helped cure roughly 260,000 people since they opened. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, Europe has become the leader in cancer treatment worldwide. The biggest hurdle, however, is that building a large particle accelerator is not cheap, and therapy can be a fortune without adequate medical coverage.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Two decades later, major technological breakthroughs may make access to these procedures less expensive. NIMMS will aim to create smaller, more powerful particle accelerators that are cost-effective and use artificial intelligence to treat tumors more effectively. Moreover, while proton-based treatment has been effective over the last several years, today’s carbon ion beam therapy seems to be far more precise and effective.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“NIMMS aims at a technology leap by the wide use of superconductivity and new magnet designs based on recent work for particle physics accelerators,” Dr. Maurizio Vretenar, NIMMS project lead at CERN, told&nbsp;<em>The Debrief.</em>&nbsp;“We are also considering alternative and more compact accelerator designs and extensive use of artificial intelligence in the design and operation of the accelerator.”<br>
</span></p>

(Image: CERN)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Traditional radiotherapy uses X-rays, photons, and, more recently, protons to kill cancer cells with powerful radiation. The problem is that surrounding healthy cells, organs, and tissue can also become damaged. Even proton beams used in hadron therapy can&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/cern-takes-next-step-for-hadron-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">cause damage</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to surrounding cells. Modern ion radiotherapy is far more precise.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Ion radiotherapy directly damages the DNA of cancerous cells, creating a large number of double-strand breakings that are not reparable and lead to the death of the cell,” explained Dr. Vretenar. “Ions are much more effective than other forms of radiotherapy, and on top of that, the damage can be easily concentrated on the cancerous region by adjusting the size and the energy of the ion beam, sparing the healthy tissue close to the cancer.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Because so few facilities can offer hadron therapy, NIMMS is developing models to make the particle accelerators smaller and less expensive. By reducing the barrier to build and operate a particle accelerator, more hospitals may put them into operation. If the system can become small enough, existing medical facilities will not require much additional real estate to install them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Our favoured design is a superconducting synchrotron ring only eight meters in diameter, followed by an eight-meter long “snake” made of superconducting magnets that rotates around the patient to deliver the ion beam on the required position. Including all shielding and protections, this system will occupy an area of about 40 meters by 20 meters,” Dr. Vretenar stated.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The specific CERN accelerators Dr. Vretenar refers to create carbon ions at 430 MeV (Mega electron-volt), which is enough energy to pass ions over and through a human body but are small enough that they don’t require a ton of space.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Vretenar admits that cancer is a complex disease and is well aware that it cannot be fought with only one type of tool. However, PIMMS has proven that more tools in the kit can lead to victories on the battlefield. The NIMMS project strives to make those tools more affordable and allow more people to access ion-based therapy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“With this technology, we aim at adding a new flexible and possibly affordable element to the arsenal of cancer-fighting techniques. While conventional radiotherapy will certainly remain in use for a large number of cancers, deep cancers close to critical organs, in particular, the hypoxic type, will be more effectively and precisely cured with ion therapy,” Dr. Vretenar told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief. “</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On top of that, by sparing radiation to nearby organs, this technique has a positive impact on the quality of life of patients after treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Vretenar believes that the future of cancer treatment will be an elegant mix of human specialists and <a href="https://thedebrief.org/deepminds-ai-makes-history-by-solving-protein-folding-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI algorithms</a> “that analyze patient DNA information, their previous medical history, and huge amounts of clinical data for similar cancer cases [to] decide the treatment strategy with the highest probability of success.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The future of cancer treatment will be less invasive as the ability to destroy a tumor without bloodshed is already a reality. If the process can be fine-tuned enough, the next step is to ensure this procedure is available worldwide and accessible to those who need it.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p>As I was writing an article for the first edition of <a href="https://pagedout.institute/">Paged Out</a>,
I had an interesting (albeit too short) conversation regarding
its <a href="https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_001_wallpaper_30.png">cover</a>
with <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=50">Gynvael Coldwind</a>.
Drawn by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>, it
features two people on the foreground, wielding what looks like guns.
This lead to a discussion on the omnipresence of military jargon, and thus violence,
in the world of computer security. I told him that I'll publish a blogpost 
to correctly articulate my thoughts on the topic, instead of the incoherent
rambling that I served him.</p>
<p>At every single security conference, there is someone with a direct quote of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">Art of War</a> on their slide
deck, and there is a metric fuckton of assorted military-inspired bullshit

<p>I understand that it's tempting to compare computer security to war: It takes our daily toil and
raises the stakes, makes us feel that victory is glorious; a battle of the
minds, that our work really matters and is important; and we are united against a common enemy.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, it's absurd: War is something terrible that should be avoided at
almost any cost, a <em>solution</em> of last resort. The worse outcome of
computer-related drama/problems probably doesn't imply entire populations
dying, being tortured, millions of refugees, camps, … Odds are that you won't
save actual lives by deploying a firewall: don't call it a "cyber bulletproof vest deployment".</p>
<p>War justifies terrible behaviours: who cares about you being screamed at when
you're <em>at war</em>? Who cares about your family life, your dinners plans, your hollidays, … when you're <em>at war</em>? What
are broken principles and despicable means, when you're <em>at war</em> ? …
which is a disastrous way to govern and organise a workspace.</p>
<p>Moreover, war maps poorly over computer security. What is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration
test</a>"
combat-wise? How do you map "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_">full disclosure</a>" to war? What is a
"prisoner's camp" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet_bombing">carpet bombing</a>" with a computer (apparently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/proof-of-concept-carpet-bombing-exploit-released-in-the-wild/">zdnet</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/carpet-bombing-ddos-attack-takes-down-south-african-isp-for-an-entire-day/">can</a> )? Rigidly mapping
one onto the other can and will create huge distortions.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody says that computer security stuff actually <em>is</em> war, but
as said in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">Metaphors We Live By </a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Johnson_(professor)">Mark
Johnson</a>, "Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape
the way we think and act.". Leading to nonsensical bullshit posts like <a href="https://twoscenarios.typepad.com/maneuver_marketing_commun/2005/05/military_metaph.html">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeslifestyle/2012/05/07/plea-for-a-cease-fire-in-business-as-warfare-advice/#f77cce37aa79">entire laughingly stupid books</a>,
and to despicable and hostile work climate.</p>
<p>An other perverse effect is that since military and violent imagery are traditionally, culturally and stereotypically associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity">toxic masculinity</a>,
this doesn't help with increasing the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">dramatically low</a> diversity in the computer security sector.</p>
<p>When we think about it, we have way better metaphors for computer security:</p>
<ul>
<li>gardening: defending against bugs, growing programs,
     harvesting money, …</li>
<li>building a house: everyone wants cosy stuff, yet you
    still need a solid door, maybe a couple of windows as well, definitely solid
    walls, …</li>
<li>playing cards: there are adversaries, winning moves,
    gambles, influences, …</li>
<li>guarding a museum: priceless artefacts, sneaky attackers
    à la Arsène Lupin, …</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of computer security is to make safer systems, not about waging wars,
and thus shouldn't be envisioned as such. </p>
<p>Of course, if you're working in the military and in infosec, there are overlaps,
but I would argue that this is more about military than it is about computer security.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybahat">Rob Bahat</a> said in 2016 in his <a href="https://shift.newco.co/2016/11/15/business-is-not-war-lets-stop-talking-like-it-is/">Business Is Not War. Let’s Stop Talking Like It Is.</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business, at its best, is creation — and war,
always, is destruction. They are opposites, and if we want industry to be a
positive force in our personal lives, environment, society, and future, we
should divorce our language about business from the tragic (if sometimes
necessary) conflicts that bring devastation. There are so many good businesses;
but it is hard to find a good war.</p>

<p>Pylustrator is a software to prepare your figures for publication in a reproducible way. This means you receive a figure
representing your data and alongside a generated code file that can exactly reproduce the figure as you put them in the
publication, without the need to readjust things in external programs.</p>
<p>Pylustrator offers an interactive interface to find the best way to present your data in a figure for publication.
Added formatting an styling can be saved by automatically generated code. To compose multiple figures to panels,
pylustrator can compose different subfigures to a single figure.</p>

<hr><div id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just get pylustrator over the pip installation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>pylustrator</span></code></p></blockquote>
<p>The package depends on:</p>
<p>numpy, matplotlib, pyqt5, qtpy, qtawesome, scikit-image, natsort</p>
</div>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage<a href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>
    <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xXPI4LLrNuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>Using pylustrator is very easy and does not require substantial modifications to your code. Just add</p>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pylustrator</span>
<span>pylustrator</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>before creating your first figure in your code. When calling <code><span>plt.show()</span></code> the plot will be displayed in a pylustrator
window.</p>
<p>You can test pylustrator with the following example code <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgerum/pylustrator/master/docs/example_pylustrator.py">example_pylustrator.py</a>:</p>

<p>Note</p>
<p>Because pylustrator can optionally save changes you’ve made in the GUI to update your source
code, it cannot be used from a shell. To use pylustrator, call it directly from a
python file and use the command line to execute.</p>
</div>
<p>The good thing is that this generated code is plain matplotlib code, so it will still work when you remove pylustrator
from your code! This is especially useful if you want to distribute your code and do not want to require pylustrator as
a dependency.</p>
<p>Can styling plots be any easier?</p>

              <p>Inspired by the blockchain system, the email system, and git versioning, Condensation is a unique solution to develop scalable and modern applications while providing the features to protect digital rights. Having a system that doesn't need to trust the Cloud enables to ensure the security and the ownership of data.</p>

                <h2>The emergence of condensed systems</h2>

                <p>
                While being entirely distributed, Condensation can store and retrieve data like a database or a file system, send data to other users or devices like a messaging system, and share and synchronize data like cloud services. Thereby, Condensation follows a distributed actor-message-passing approach and encrypts all data end-to-end.
                </p>

                <p>
                Condensation builds the bridge between the simplicity of immutable data and the easiness of implementation of mutable documents. On the client, documents are split efficiently into smaller immutable units that can be transferred freely across the network. Then, they can be condensed back when they arrive on the receiver's device. Condensed systems are free from trusting a third-party server and many new features come by design to create trust between clients such as data certification.
                </p>

                <p>
                This shift from merging data on the server to doing it on the client side, opens many new possibilities for application design. Furthermore, it is significantly more efficient if compared to existing solutions which need to build several application layers on top of existing systems to achieve the same functionalities. Before to start explaining the mechanics, this section explains the history of databases and what makes Condensation the next step in the evolution of databases.
                </p>

                <h3>Bridging the gap between mutable and immutable data structures</h3>
                    <p>
                    The structure of today's file and database systems dates back to the 1970s, when storage space was extremely scarce and computers were few. These systems were designed to run on a single machine, and mostly on a single disk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While both databases and file systems have greatly evolved over time, their main structure has hardly changed. Database systems are based on tables with mutable records (rows), while file systems use a hierarchy of folders with mutable files inside. In both systems, data can be modified with little effort, and at any time. It also has the advantage of being very efficient with regards to storage space needs. Data synchronization, however, is notoriously difficult and error prone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In todays' connected world, data is used on different devices, or is shared with other people. And, for most applications, storage space is not a limiting factor any more. Hence, efficient data synchronization is key.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>
                    Aside of file and database systems, revision control systems have been developed and used since the 1980s. Some of them, such as git or hq, are fully distributed and do not require any central server whatsoever. Each user has their own version of the data and can merge changes from other users. Such systems allow for efficient and provably correct data synchronization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While they are great for source code management, current version control systems are not suited as general purpose data systems. In order to benefit from such systems, the user needs to have a certain understanding of branches, merging, and conflict resolution, which is far beyond the knowledge of an average computer user. In addition, occasional merge conflicts are inevitable, and prevent such systems from being used in a transparent way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Condensation has been designed from the ground up to address this. The result is a general-purpose data system with lightweight transactions and efficient data synchronization in a completely distributed setting. Merge conflicts are impossible by design, hence no user intervention is required during the synchronization process. The data itself is end-to-end encrypted and may be spread across multiple storage systems.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The evolution of architectures from online to offline and serverless systems.</h3>

                    <p>
                    The structure of the data has a direct influence on the dependency from and the role of a server. With SQL and noSQL databases, the centralized server is needed to synchronize data. Accordingly, it is the place where the application logic occurs. As a result, the system only works when being online. Also, as the data is read and processes by the server, it is vulnerable to data breaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Working offline became possible later, by storing documents in the application and defining schemas for synchronization when the application is turned back to online mode. However, this process is complex and requires a handling logic on both the client and the server side. Moreover, scaling a central database was a major issue. Many systems developed distributed systems for horizontal scaling but in a controlled data center setup where all servers are entrusted and available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As described previously, Condensation only transfer immutable data on the network, which allows to build fully distributed but yet very simple systems. The following scheme summarizes the comparison between existing systems types.

                Condensation leverage the advantages of immutable objects. You never have to lock them, which extremely improves concurrency also it improves simplicity as persistance to certify the data isn't compromised and exactly the same as the source. Furthermore, it allows to reduce the memory usage as objects can be reused to create new trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                Developers can benefit from features available by design such as: data certification with user signature, versionning with transaction history, and conflict free merge based on CRDTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                So, Condensation has a hybrid data structure, it merge data into mutable documents stored locally and transfers immutable objects through stores. The stores can be managed in a single server or in a purely distributed manner without introducing complexities.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the following sections, first the data structure is technically described to explain how Condensation transform a document into an immutable merkle tree. Next, to better understand how Condensation manage securely data on the network, the flow of the data through a …</p></article></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>We need new Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) for this new era of computing. We need a CAS that dispatches in the multiple ways we think. We need a CAS that scales exponentially like our problems. We need a CAS that integrates with our package ecosystem, letting people extend parts and contribute back to the core library all in one language. We need a modern CAS in a modern language.</p>
<p>Symbolics.jl is the answer. Symbolics.jl is a pure Julia CAS which uses the Julia core library to its fullest. It is built from the ground up with performance in mind. We use specialized structures for automatic simplification to match the performance of the most fully optimized C++ libraries. It exploits parallelism at every level; our symbolic simplification takes advantage of Julia's task-based multithreading to transform symbolic equations into parallelized Julia code.</p>
<p>This reconstruction of the idea of CAS in Julia's type system is entirely extensible. New term types enable fast symbolic arithmetic on standard and non-standard algebras; add-on libraries like ModelingToolkit build a bridge from symbolics to numerics. Symbolics.jl and its ecosystem will be the common foundation on which the next generation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) will be constructed, automatically updated and accelerated through with the growth of this system.</p>
<h2 id="the_features_of_symbolicsjl"><a href="#the_features_of_symbolicsjl">The Features of Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>Symbolics.jl at its launch in 2021 is already expansive. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symbolic arithmetic with type information and multiple dispatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic polynomials and trigonometric functions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pattern matching, simplification and substitution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Differentiation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic linear algebra (factorizations, inversion, determinants, eigencomputations, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discrete math (representations of summations, products, binomial coefficients, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logical and Boolean expressions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic equation solving and conversion to arbitrary precision</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for non-standard algebras (non-commutative symbols and customizable rulesets)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Special functions (list provided by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl">SpecialFunctions.jl</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatic conversion of Julia code to symbolic code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generation of (high performance and parallel) functions from symbolic expressions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fast automated sparsity detection and generation of sparse Jacobian and Hessians</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more. A lot of these features are for free given its deep integration with multiple dispatch and Julia's type system.</p>
<h2 id="connection_to_the_package_ecosystem"><a href="#connection_to_the_package_ecosystem">Connection to the Package Ecosystem</a></h2>
<h3 id="the_connection_to_the_modelingtoolkitjl"><a href="#the_connection_to_the_modelingtoolkitjl">The Connection to the ModelingToolkit.jl</a></h3>
<p>Here in the Julia world, we like differntial equations, maybe a little too much.</p>
<p>Symbolics.jl grew out of ModelingToolkit.jl, an equation-based modeling system for the Julia programming language. Its vision is that the best system for modeling requires having the ability to symbolically specify models and build a library of transformations for generating more stable and performant code. While software in a similar space like Simulink and Modelica are disconnected from traditional programming languages and symbolic algebra systems, ModelingToolkit.jl weaves them together, allowing all aspects of the Julia programming language and symbolic computing to contribute to the richness of its design.</p>
<p>The ModelingToolkit.jl project has been almost too much of a success in that respect, reaching a feature-base that included an entire CAS as a submodule within itself. It was time for that CAS to be set free. Symbolics.jl is that CAS, now set in its own organization, JuliaSymbolics, with its ability to transform new domains.</p>
<p>ModelingToolkit.jl will continue to provide the symbolic representations of common numeric systems and the SciML organization, such as causal and acausal modeling (Simulink/Modelica) in the domains of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ordinary differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stochastic differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Partial differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nonlinear systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimization problems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimal Control</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will continue to power the connection the next generation of symbolic-numeric computation, blurring the boundaries by mixing analytical solutions with optimized and parallelized generated code. All symbolic functionality related to those domains will continue to thrive in that package, leaving Symbolics.jl the room to focus on the core of symbolic algebras: polynomials, Grobner bases, and more.</p>
<h3 id="the_connection_to_symbolicutilsjl"><a href="#the_connection_to_symbolicutilsjl">The Connection to SymbolicUtils.jl</a></h3>
<p>Symbolics.jl is an opinionated CAS. It types its variables so that generic Julia functions which require <code>Real</code> numbers can automatically be converted into symbolic expressions. It uses the Leibniz rules for defining derivatives. It does symbolic algebra as "the normal person would expect".</p>
<p>However, there are some use cases in computational algebra which require non-standard rulesets. How would you define symbolic Octonian numbers or define differentiation on non-smooth manifolds that do not satisfy the Leibniz rule? For these questions, mathematicians have traditionally been on their own having to develop new tools from scratch. However, the JuliaSymbolics has refactored its core so that new algebras can easily be implemented and created, and automatically get the optimized high performance of Symbolics.jl. This is SymbolicUtils.jl.</p>
<p>SymbolicUtils.jl is a fast and parallel rule-based rewrite system. By specifying a list of rules, such as trigonometric identities, you can specify new mathematical domains and create the symbolic arithmetic that you need. Symbolics.jl is built on this foundation, adding the common simplification rules for real numbers, derivative definitions and rules for Newton differentiation, and more. However, if you're so inclined, SymbolicUtils.jl is open for you to define BraKet algebras and more.</p>
<h2 id="goals_for_symbolicsjl"><a href="#goals_for_symbolicsjl">Goals for Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>Symbolics.jl will be a never ending project as we wish to provide a high performance implementation of every symbolic algorithm that can and does exist. But, there are specific goals we have in mind.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance_symbolic_arithmetic"><a href="#high-performance_symbolic_arithmetic">High-Performance Symbolic Arithmetic</a></h3>
<p>Anywhere that we are beat in performance is a bug. Please file an issue immediately. This library should use every core, and it should use every core efficiently, allowing the exponential cost of symbolic arithmetic to tackled by the exponential gains in computational power and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="pervasiveness_throughout_the_julia_dsls"><a href="#pervasiveness_throughout_the_julia_dsls">Pervasiveness Throughout the Julia DSLs</a></h3>
<p>We want to provide a symbolic foundation which all DSLs can rely on. We do not believe that a pharmacometrics library should define how to symbolically calculate a Hessian, and then the mathematical programming library JuMP, etc. We believe that by pooling together on Symbolics.jl, we can accelerate the growth of DSLs throughout the language, offering a way to collaborate towards a single battletested implementation.</p>
<h3 id="bridge_the_gap_from_computer_scientists_to_scientists_and_mathematicans"><a href="#bridge_the_gap_from_computer_scientists_to_scientists_and_mathematicans">Bridge the Gap from Computer Scientists to Scientists and Mathematicans</a></h3>
<p>While "code" is what package developers like to see, math is what practioners are trained on. We are committed to bridging that gap, making it easy to see the LaTeX-ification of the symbolic variables, creating informative displays in notebooks. Symbolics.jl should look and feel like doing math.</p>
<h3 id="feature_completeness"><a href="#feature_completeness">Feature Completeness</a></h3>
<p>We want Symbolics.jl to be the place where you check the documentation immediately for symbolic methods, knowing that if such a method exists then it's implemented there. Symbolics.jl should not just cover the domain but also be an archive of its research and science, making it easy to explore algorithms and compare between them.</p>
<h2 id="next_steps_for_symbolicsjl"><a href="#next_steps_for_symbolicsjl">Next Steps for Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>We have not met all of our goals yet. While much of this roadmap has been accomplished, there is much in our way forward. Some major goals on our sights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symbolic integration using <a href="https://rulebasedintegration.org/">RUBI</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Expansive algorithm selection for Grobner Basis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feature parity with SymPy (<a href="https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl/issues/59">being tracked here</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integration with distributed and GPU computation</p>
</li>
<li><p>High performance symbolic root finding</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrating modern techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01412.pdf">deep learning to accelerate and improve symbolic rule application</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Tools for <a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org/">transforming generated equations to have minimal floating point error</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>A full reproducible benchmarking suite</p>
</li>
</ul>

					<p><a href="https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/">Kernel Linux</a> &gt; <a href="https://blog.frizn.fr/linux-kernel/cve-2020-14381">The curious case of CVE-2020-14381</a></p>

                    <h3>The curious case of CVE-2020-14381</h3>                    
                    <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of this interesting kernel bug I worked
on last year with <a href="https://twitter.com/bluec0re" target="_blank">@bluec0re</a>,
and as it turns out I wrote something about it during one of these lockdown
weekends so I thought I'd release it. <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2015" target="_blank" title="CVE-2020-14381 get_futex_key use-after-free">The bug itself</a>
was discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">Jann Horn</a>
of Project Zero. While I touch most of the elements required to exploit the
bug, I stay superficial here since the exploit itself is not particularly
exciting. What makes this bug interesting to me is its lifecycle, in particular
how unevenly the patch was applied to the various distributions. I also talk
briefly about hardware side-channels since it was the first time I had ever
used one.</p>

<p><strong>The bug</strong></p><p>It’s already well-described in the bug tracker, but here is another summary.
The <span>futex</span> syscall's main parameter is a userland address, and this address
may belong to a file-backed mapping. In that case, the futex key kernel object
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L707" target="_blank">held</a>
and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L724" target="_blank">kept</a>
a reference to the inode object, but didn’t hold a reference to the file’s mountpoint.
If the mountpoint were to go away, its associated kernel structures would be
freed, but the inode wouldn’t. That’s an issue because the inode itself has
fields that point to some of these structures, such as its <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L641" target="_blank">super_block</a>
struct.</p>

<p>Further use of the inode by <span>futex</span> code paths may therefore trigger
use-after-frees. One particular code path highlighted by Jann in the bug happens
when the <span>futex</span> is destroyed: the last reference to the inode is released
and the inode needs to be freed. This is done in <span>iput</span> which then calls
<span>iput_final</span>. <span>iput_final</span> and its subcalls will then call inode
management functions stored in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1942" target="_blank">super_operations</a>
struct accessed <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1533" target="_blank">from the super_block</a>
object. The first instance happens right at the beginning of <span>iput_final</span> with
a call to the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1539" target="_blank">drop_inode</a>
function.</p>

<p>Exploiting this bug requires being able to:
</p><ul>
  <li>Successfully <span>umount</span> a mountpoint. A no-go a few years ago, but
  possible nowadays with the normalization of unprivileged user namespaces.
  It’s a good example that this feature was never a trivial security tradeoff
  (unprivileged sandboxes v. augmented kernel attack surface) which in turn
  makes it somewhat surprising that all mainstream distributions enabled them by default
  without much debate</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode()</span> execution (non-SMEP or a KASLR bypass)</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode</span> indirection just before that (non-SMAP
  or a stack/heap leak)</li>
  <li>Do everything in one call, because with an incorrect inode state, a corrupted
  super_block and some linked lists unlinks to do in the remainder of <span>iput_final</span>,
  it’s doubtful we can even get as far as the second <span>super_operations</span>
  function pointer call (<span>evict_inode</span>)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p><p>The first exploitation pathway that comes to mind goes as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li>wait for the <span>super_block</span> to be freed. It’s done in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/super.c#L299" target="_blank">an RCU callback</a>
  so one way or another you need to wait for the end of the RCU grace period
  after <span>umount</span> returns, e.g. with <span>membarrier</span>. For a PoC, spraying
  allocs for the duration of the expedited grace period works well enough since
  the <span>super_block</span> slab, <span>kmalloc-2k</span>, is not super busy.</li>
  <li>overwrite the freed <span>super_block</span> via a dynamic heap allocation primitive
  (e.g. <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/net/socket.c#L2264" target="_blank">sendmsg ancillary data</a>).</li>
  <li>point <span>s_op</span> to an attacker-controlled buffer</li>
  <li>point <span>drop_inode</span> to a chain of gadgets that pivot the stack to
  either the <span>super_block</span> or <span>super_operations</span> bufffers (which
  are both necessarily in registers and almost fully controlled). Example of
  common gadgets that would work in this situation would be <span>push reg; jmp/call [reg+x]</span>
  that can then be chained with a <span>pop rsp; ret</span> gadget placed at <span>[reg+x]</span></li>
  <li>do whatever with your unconstrained ROP, fixup the stack and return</li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a sucky exploit to maintain as it relies on precise knowledge
of the kernel image, but that’s as good as it gets for a raw function pointer
execution without a read primitive in kernel space. The portability issues
for exploits like this are in themselves a significant bonus of SMEP: it rarely
prevents exploitation but makes many candidates much less appealing for weaponization.</p>

<p>We can take SMEP for granted. It’s only one CPU generation / 2 years older
than SMAP, but not having it is getting really rare. Plus if your exploit does
rely on no-SMEP but your target ends up having software SMEP enabled, which
you sometimes can't really tell at runtime, you've just turned a privesc attempt into
a lost foothold. No-SMAP however is still a thing for the time being. As a
random example the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/intel/" target="_blank" title="AWS EC2 intel CPUs">AWS EC2 CPU roster</a>
shows some CPUs that do not support SMAP.</p>

<p><strong>On infoleak bugs</strong></p><p>In any case, to exploit this bug one needs at least one infoleak. The most
important is to get kernel base for gadgets, and then we could use a heap leak
or similar to support SMAP-capable CPUs (to have our "attacker-controlled
buffer" in point 3 above in kernel space). A heap/stack leak can often yield
a .text address as well so having one would kill two birds with one stone.
But, not everyone has the right infoleak in their stash ready to go, contrary
to a common anti-KASLR argument. And even when you do have an infoleak bug,
it doesn't mean that it will help with your current exploit.</p>

<p>For instance, a good infoleak candidate which was released around the same
time last year would be the one with uninitialized memory in coredumps, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10732" target="_blank">CVE-2020-10732</a>.
But short of a public proof-of-concept, one needs to understand the coredump
generation code, then find an object in that slab that allows us to get
.text, and another one to deduce a heap address you control. In short, at least
as much work as the rest of the exploit we are looking at. And that's without
considering that using two bugs in one exploit also means that you need to
take into account both bugs limitations. Unprivileged user namespaces for the
main bug we are looking at (not a thing on e.g. RHEL 7), and for the coredump,
well the ability to retrieve the core files, i.e. not running in a container.
Luckily for our project, we already knew we were targeting non-SMAP containers
so we were able to avoid spending all that effort on an infoleak bug that
would have ended up being worthless; a luxury that real exploit developpers
preparing capabilities ahead of time do not have. But if we were targeting
SMAP containers, well that would have been it since more effort would have
exceeded our resource budget for this project.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware side-channels</strong></p><p>For kernel .text however, the situation is different since there are generic,
publicly-documented ways to obtain kernel base: hardware vulns. I personally
hadn’t ever used any and even saw them as a niche exploitation technique
relying on opaque CPU heuristics that don’t hold across models - not something
to be considered for resilient exploits. I was simply wrong, but thankfully
had access to many specialists (<a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">@tehjh</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/_fel1x" target="_blank">@_fel1x</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_tsuro" target="_blank">@_tsuro</a>)
who knew better.</p>

<p>While side-channels that allow leaking memory across security boundaries
are hopefully bound to be mitigated, there are many side-channels that leak
addresses and which we haven’t heard much about since Spectre and friends.
These ones are probably here to stay even longer. For this project I used <a href="https://github.com/tpn/pdfs/blob/master/Jump%20Over%20ASLR%20-%20Attacking%20Branch%20Predictors%20to%20Bypass%20ASLR%20-%202016%20(micro16).pdf" target="_blank" title="jump over aslr paper">Jump Over ASLR</a>,
which was published before Spectre in 2016. It’s simple to understand (especially
with access to the aforementioned people) and there are PoCs that are just
waiting to be adjusted to your own scenario (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/felixwilhelm/mario_baslr" target="_blank" title="mario_baslr jump over aslr">mario_baslr</a>
from @_fel1x). Jump Over ASLR relies on the inner workings of the Branch Target
Buffer where user and kernel branches may collide. When that happens, the CPU
has more work to do and that can be observed. This allows leaking kernel base 
as long as you have offsets of branches hit during a short kernel path you
can trigger at will: you can then leverage the low entropy of KASLR to try
all possible base addresses and find the one where the branches are hit.</p>

<p>For the parameters (the branches to measure) you can really use whatever
you want. I only tried the <span>creat</span> syscall with arguments that cause a
fast return to userland, and then measured whether the <span>sys_creat</span> and
<span>do_sys_open</span> offsets had been hit. The offsets need to be fairly precise
but not to the byte since there seems to be some aliasing going on in the branch
predictor: I originally used <span>__fentry__</span> as an additional branch target
at a +5 offset for both symbols which still worked even though I later learned
these calls get <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/747256/" target="_blank">dynamically patched out</a>.
</p>

<p>With proper filtering of both false negatives and false positives (essentially
double checking each address) this works like a charm on recent Intel CPUs,
and it’s one of many such techniques that have been published in the past
6 years or so. That makes it something we should be able to rely on as exploit
developers for the foreseeable future. So for a known kernel image at least,
we are essentially back to pre-KASLR times - and keep in mind that it’s a
field I know fairly poorly so other side-channels are probably even better.</p>

<p><strong>Patch gap</strong></p><p>Ok here is what I personally found really interesting because I had never
looked into kernel bug timelines before. This bug was initially reported on
February 28 2020, and fixed in tip on March 3. At this point it’s essentially
public for anyone keeping an eye out for interesting kernel patches - even
if you don’t spend too much time on it, a <span>reported-by</span> Jann Horn is
worth looking into. The main kernel lines were fixed either on March 25 or
April 2. If you’re thinking “oh wow one whole month”, please be seated for
what’s coming.</p>

<p>Some distros applied the patch almost immediately:
</p><ul>
  <li>Arch Linux: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Gentoo: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Fedora: Mar 26</li>
</ul>


<p>I know they are not supposed to target workstations specifically but outside
of personal servers I don't think I have ever seen them used otherwise. The
2nd batch of distributions that fixed the bug is arguably more server-ready:
</p><ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS: Apr 7</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: Apr 24</li>
  <li>Debian Buster …</li></ul></div></div>

The app offers access to 10,000+ tokens, 300+ swap pairs, and direct access to ETH and TRX-based DApps in Klever Browser. Klever is a decentralized p2p and self-custody wallet, putting the private keys in the hands of our users.</p><p>Klever Ecosystem is serving above 2 million users globally with Klever App, Klever Swap and Klever OS. Klever's emerging platforms Klever Blockchain, Klever Exchange and Klever Bank are set to launch in 2021, all powered by the utility token KLV that is burnt after usage.</p><p>KLV serves as the fuel for the entire Klever ecosystem, powering Klever Swap and significantly reducing exchange fees. KLV Staking allows users to support the project and earn community rewards as the network grows, with over 62% of all KLV in circulation currently frozen and staked by Klever users.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b28e236-65ca-4f05-8fca-e3fd025fd99f_1203x1280.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b28e236-65ca-4f05-8fca-e3fd025fd99f_1203x1280.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8b28e236-65ca-4f05-8fca-e3fd025fd99f_1203x1280.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;width&quot;:1203,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1846064,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Klever offers true self-custody, self-banking and secure ownership of your cryptocurrency. The security of Klever App is ensured by being built on top of Klever OS SDK, which uses advanced security mechanisms that protect the users’ private keys and funds.&nbsp;</p><p>With Klever App you are free to export your 12 words and private keys and use it with other wallets in the market. But it’s important to remember to never share your seed or private key with strangers. If there’s someone asking you for that info, they are scammers.</p><div><p>But what Klever is more than anything is a tool for the little guy to reclaim their financial freedom. It’s an ecosystem of products that empowers our users to do more with their money, and gives them the confidence and security to learn more about crypto and decentralized peer-to-peer technologies.</p><p><em><strong>Question 2: Can you tell us more about Klever’s user base and how you adapt your products to a global audience?<br></strong></em><br>Klever has over 2 million users worldwide, and our app has been downloaded in over 190 countries. We currently have over 100,000 daily active users (DAU) using Klever every single day, with the three largest markets being the US, India and Nigeria. </p></div><p>The Klever App is available in more than 24 languages in order to cater to our global user base, and there is an option for all amounts, prices and values to be viewed in more than 164 different local fiat currencies. It’s important to add that Klever was translated by our community.</p><div><p>What is very exciting is that the underdeveloped and unbanked world has really taken a shine in Klever and is a readily growing market for us. Meanwhile, our 24/7 customer support is always available to guide and assist our users in case of questions or if they face an issue. </p><p><em><strong>Question 3: Could you tell us more about what is going in the development of Klever’s upcoming platforms, and address the current Klever Roadmap?</strong></em></p></div><p>We are working hard to scale our products for the growing demand of new crypto users entering the blockchain space. At the same time, we have a big squad working around the clock to finish our new Klever Exchange and make sure it has a great experience for our users. We currently have more than 50 full-time developers, or ninjas as we call them. We are constantly growing and aiming to have over 500 people working with Klever by next year.&nbsp;</p><p>During the past weeks we have tested the first releases of Klever Browser and Klever Exchange apps and many exciting challenges are present in both apps. Klever Roadmap is an ambitious plan and it may take some time to be completed, however, I’m glad to say that our team is more than capable of delivering new ground-breaking products that can impact the entire crypto industry. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://klever.io/en/roadmap"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2aa8f1e-eb5f-4d49-a39b-d0329b998b62_1280x720.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2aa8f1e-eb5f-4d49-a39b-d0329b998b62_1280x720.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:560607,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://klever.io/en/roadmap&quot;}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>You can check the roadmap and our whitepapers here:<br><a href="https://klever.io/en/roadmap">https://klever.io/en/roadmap</a></p><p>KLV White Paper:<br><a href="https://klever.io/downloads/Klever_Whitepaper_v1.5.pdf">https://klever.io/downloads/Klever_Whitepaper_v1.5.pdf</a></p><p>Klever Blockchain Whitepaper:<br><a href="https://www.klever.finance/s/Klever_Finance_Whitepaper_V1.pdf">https://www.klever.finance/s/Klever_Finance_Whitepaper_V1.pdf</a></p><p><em><strong>Question 4.

However, it's one of the most confusing Hooks (at least in my experience). But if you spend some time to learn how it works, you'll see that it's actually a hidden gem 💎, a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p><p>I'll reveal this shiny gem <span>💎</span> for you in four steps:</p><ol><li>What is it used for?</li><li>The mental model</li><li>A couple of contrived examples (but they are really helpful for learning)</li><li>A couple of real-world examples</li></ol><p>This article assumes that you are familiar with React basics, as well as how to use the <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> hooks.</p><h2><a id="what-is-useref-used-for" href="#what-is-useref-used-for"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>What is useRef used for?</a></h2><p>There are two use cases.</p><h3><a id="directly-access-dom-nodes" href="#directly-access-dom-nodes"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Directly access DOM nodes</a></h3><p>When combined with the <code>ref</code> attribute, we could use <code>useRef</code> to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively. In fact, this is really an escape hatch. We should only do this sparsely for things that React doesn't provide a declarative API for, such as focus management. If we use it for everything (in theory we could), we'd lose the benefit of <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/what-is-react#declarative-ui">React's declarative programming paradigm</a>.</p><h3><a id="persist-a-value-across-rerenders" href="#persist-a-value-across-rerenders"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Persist a value across rerenders</a></h3><p>This is what I'm going to focus on in this article.

And it clicked! If you are hearing the same clicking sound in your mind right now already, feel free to skip to <a href="https://learnreact.design/posts/react-useref-by-example#example-1-previous-value--state">the examples section</a>. Otherwise, if you are not familiar with JavaScript classes or class instance variables, read on. This section is for you.</p><h3><a id="the-rerendering-time-loop" href="#the-rerendering-time-loop"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The "rerendering time loop"</a></h3><p>To understand how <code>useRef</code> works and why we need it, let's get started with a contrived (but useful) example. Can you build a counter without using the <code>useState</code> hook?</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>This doesn't work, even though the value of <code>count</code> increases on click. Why? React is oblivious to the change of local variables and, therefore, doesn't know when to update the DOM. We'd need to rerender the component, namely request React to call the component function <code>Counter</code>, to let the change reflected on the screen.</p><p>You can verify this by uncommenting the line <code>console.log('render')</code> right after <code>let count = 0</code>. The component isn't rendered when the user clicks the button.</p><p>OK. Then what if we force the component to render when <code>count</code> updates?</p><p>This doesn't work either. The count displayed on the page stays zero. Even worse, the count value in the console stopped working too. It's always <code>0</code>!</p><p>BTW, <code>useForceRender</code> above is a custom hook:</p><p>Why? This is what I call <strong><em>rerendering time loop</em></strong>.</p><div><p><img alt="Time loop" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Every time when the component rerenders, it goes into a time loop. All the local variables in the function will be reset to their original values. That's why <code>count</code> is always <code>0</code>.</p><p>That's no surprise, right? They are local variables defined in the function. When the function reruns, the variables are supposed to behave like that!</p><p>As straighforward as this sounds, sometimes it's easy to forget (I do it all the time). So remember, since a React component is rerendered all the time, all the local variables will go into a time loop, over and over again.</p><div><p>Does this "rerendering time loop" metaphor make sense to you?</p></div><p>So, we need a solution that survives this "rerendering time loop". We want to preserve the value no matter how many times the component is rendered. If we update <code>count</code> to <code>42</code>, at the next render it should still be <code>42</code>, not the initial value <code>0</code>.</p><p>Let's try the first approach: what if we move the variable out of the component function? It will no longer be affected by the rerendering time loop, right?</p><p>That's correct! It works! Yay!</p><h3><a id="component-instances" href="#component-instances"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Component instances</a></h3><p>But wait a second, what if we want to have two counters?</p><div><div><div><div><div><p>Click both buttons a few times: </p></div></div></div></div></div><p>So our counters are still broken. Did you try it in the preview window? The two counters are tied together. Clicking one button changes the other counter too!</p><p>That's because both counters are tied to the same variable <code>count</code>. What we need instead is to have a <strong><em>separate</em></strong> variable for each <strong><em>instance</em></strong> of the counter.</p><p>So the requirements are:</p><ol><li>Persist a value across rerenders</li><li>Persist the value per component instance, throughout the full lifetime of that instance</li></ol><p>Introducing <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>But, but we are still using that <code>useForceRender</code> to update the DOM! If we comment out <code>forceRender()</code>, the counter stops working again! (try it)</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it relies on <code>useState</code> to work properly? Why don't we just use <code>useState</code>?</p><p>What's the point of <code>useRef</code> if it doesn't trigger a rerender when the value is updated?</p><p>In fact, being able to persist a value across rerenders <em>without</em> triggering another rerender is exactly why <code>useRef</code> is created. Sometimes we just don't want the component to rerender when the value is updated.</p><p>It's now time to look at a better example.</p><h2><a id="example-1-previous-value--state" href="#example-1-previous-value--state"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 1: previous value / state</a></h2><p>Let's modify the Counter component. Now we want to display the previous value of the counter whenever the button is clicked. We can do so using a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, and of course <code>useRef</code>.</p><p>Look, when saving the previous state in <code>useEffect</code>, we definitely don't want the component to rerender. Otherwise, it'd go into an infinite loop. So, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue!</p><h2><a id="example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval" href="#example-2-stop-watch-clear-interval"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)</a></h2><p>Now let's look at a more useful example. How about a stop watch?</p><p>We can make the stop watch tick with a combination of <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code> and <code>setInterval</code>:</p><p>But how do we pause the stop watch?</p><p>We can add another state <code>ticking</code> and clear the interval when <code>ticking</code> is <code>false</code>. Let's give it a try:</p><p>Did you see the problem? Where should we define that variable <code>interval</code>?</p><p>If we define <code>interval</code> in the outer scope, we'll taste the wrath of the rerendering time loop -- <code>interval</code> will always be <code>undefined</code>.</p><p>We don't want to put it in state either, since it's really not something we would want to display on the UI. It's interval stuff.</p><p>Again, <code>useRef</code> to the rescue:</p><p>You can check out a fully working <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-cancelable-interval-uljky?file=/src/App.js">CodeSandbox here</a>.</p><h2><a id="example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat" href="#example-3-press-and-hold-to-repeat"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Example 3: Press and hold to repeat</a></h2><p>Let's check out the real thing! Just a reminder, this is what we want to build (remember to click and hold):</p><p>We are going to focus on the press-and-hold behavior:</p><ol><li>When the mouse is down, wait a little bit;</li><li>If the mouse is still down after a threshold, say 500 milliseconds, start repeatedly increasing the like count at an interval until the mouse is up;</li></ol><p>How would we implement this behavior?</p><p>In order to detect the press-and-hold gesture, we can use <code>setTimeout</code>. When the mouse is down, kick off the timeout. When the mouse is up, clear the timeout.</p><p>How do we set and clear the timeout when the component is rendered and rerendered, i.e. when the state <code>mouseDown</code> changes?</p><p>You already know the answer from Example 2, right? <code>useRef</code>!</p><p>Next, how do we repeatedly increase the like count? <code>setInterval</code> is what we need. And of course we'll use another ref to keep track of the interval reference across rerenders.</p><p>Finally, we can extract all the logic into a custom Hook <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code>:</p><p>When using the <code>usePressHoldRepeat</code> hook, remember to use <code>useCallback</code> to prevent excess renders due to the fact the function might be recreated on each render (time loop).</p><p>Check out the full source code in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/likebutton-usepressholdrepeat-3b1qo">this CodeSandbox</a></p><p>Note: The animation in this example is implemented with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.framer.com/api/motion/">Framer Motion</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mainText"><h2 id="making-of-open-source-software">Making of Open Source software</h2><p>I’ve recently made my way through <em>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em> by Nadia Eghbal. Not only does it have some absolutely stunning cover art, it also touches on some thoughts that have been marinating in my head about the intersection of open source and funding. So much so, that I’ve started experiencing the Baader-Meinhof effect, seeing something to do with open source and funding everywhere I look in tweets, conversations, and blogs.</p><p>This blog post is an exploration of processes in open source, the value it provides, and how money fits into the picture.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/oss_book.jpg" alt="Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software"><em>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em></p><h3 id="how-its-made">How it’s made</h3><blockquote><p>“Open source developers were frequently characterized as ‘hobby’ developers, because the assumption was that only companies could make ‘real’ software."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>As it stands, there are two primary schools of thought about how open source software is created.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Firm-based</strong> production involves companies, organizations, governments, or any institution with centralized resources. Their driving thesis is that only companies make software because, from a coordination standpoint, centralized firms are the most efficient way to manage resources. Most development done this way is motivated extrinsically by means of monetary compensation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commons-based</strong> production is a more vague concept that involves a distributed group of developers that work on a resource that is used, owned, and governed by its own community - free of employer affiliations. Most development done this way is motivated intrinsically, people do work because they want to do it.</p></li></ol><p>Traditionally, software has been seen as a product of firms. Open source developers were often treated as hobbyists and the projects they made trivialized as toys. The assumption was that only companies could make ‘real’ software. However, the rise of Internet computing and collaboration tools like Git have decreased the barrier to entry enough that producing software through a commons is now feasible and very much alive. The success of projects like Apache, Linux, and FreeBSD proved just how successful a commons-based method of production could be.</p><p>Surprisingly, this may also help to explain why some developers view open source and money as completely separate. If the commons-based method of production is rooted in intrinsic motivation, then money, an extrinsic motivator, will be seen as opposite to core ideals that open source stands for.</p><h2 id="creation-vs-maintenance">Creation vs Maintenance</h2><blockquote><p>“Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation”</p><p>@balupton, isaacs/github <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/167">#167</a></p></blockquote><p>When an artist finishes a painting, or a runner finishes a marathon, that usually signifies the end of said responsibility. There is no such finish line for an open source project, even after pushing out an initial product.</p><p>Creating a project is fun. It’s a wild exploration into a new idea, a frivolous journey to create something useful or to learn something new. As cloud platforms continue to eat the world, the costs of distributing and sharing a project are almost completely nullified.</p><p>Just a few clicks and a few taps of your keyboard and your project is readily available to any of the 4.66 billion people around the world with internet access. This adrenaline rush of finally releasing the labour of your work onto the world is the moment developers are constantly chasing. For most developers, the process of creation and distribution is intrinsically motivated; it’s an enjoyable process.</p><p>Maintenance is less so. This is akin to a writer that’s been asked to edit and revise the same book day in and day out, long after they’ve reaped the initial financial and reputational rewards from its creation. Even when the creator wants to leave the project to work on something else, they can’t. They’re tightly shackled by the fact that hundreds of thousands of other organizations, companies, and tools rely on their code to keep their operations running. Bringing on additional developers may not help either, as they still require onboarding, code reviews, and general guidance.</p><p>Code may be nearly free to create and distribute, but maintenance is still expensive.</p><h2 id="types-of-code">Types of code</h2><h3 id="code-as-an-artifact">Code as an artifact</h3><p>There are two main ways we can look at code. The first of which is <em>static</em> code. Code that, on its own, does nothing but exists as an archive. Others can copy and download the code without incurring any additional costs to the author. For the maintainers, it should make no difference in regards to cost whether 10 or 10,000 people use it.</p><p>This type of code is a pool resource, it is</p><ol><li><strong>Non-rivalry.</strong> My ability to copy the code doesn’t affect your ability to copy it. (This isn’t exactly true due to some marginal costs but I’ll discuss this later)</li><li><strong>Non-excludable.</strong> If someone has a copy of the code, it is very difficult to prevent them from sharing that code with others.</li></ol><p>Any code that is in this state is easy to share, copy, and distribute. This is the type of code that lives dormant on Github, on StackOverflow answers, and in GitHub’s Arctic Vault<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. However, the main purpose of consuming code is not to simply read and study it, but to actually use it and to let it interact with other code.
In doing so, we bring it to life.</p><h3 id="code-as-an-organism">Code as an organism</h3><blockquote><p>“Open source code derives its value not from its static qualities but from its living ones."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>As soon as you hit CTRL-V on that snippet of code, as soon as that static code is inserted into your own, that code comes to life. It might surface ridiculous amounts of red squigglies, break other code, or force you to rewrite your previous code just to make it work. When code transitions from a resting static state to an active living state, it starts to incur a set of hidden costs.</p><p>Like a living organism in a symbiotic relationship, there is a mutual interdependence between it and others in the software ‘ecosystem’ in order to survive. As a result, this ecosystem requires constant upkeep to ensure that components don’t fall out of balance: dependency bumps, documentation updates, and infrastructure changes.</p><h2 id="free-as-in-speech-not-as-in-beer">Free as in speech, not as in beer</h2><p>‘Free’ software doesn’t refer to its price. In fact, ‘free’ software is often extremely expensive. As Richard Stallman first described free software, it’s “free as in speech, not free as in beer.” The point Stallman was trying to make was that ‘free’ refers to what one could do with the software, rather than the price tag.</p><h3 id="latent-cost-of-software">Latent cost of software</h3><p>In reality, code in its alive state is more like a free puppy. In the beginning, it’s a great and wonderful thing! Super fun and super cute. As it grows and gets older, you realize “geez, it actually takes a lot of my own time to take care of this thing.” Unlike a piece of inanimate furniture, bringing a living creature into one’s home comes with bringing in a new set of responsibilities too.</p><p><strong>Marginal costs</strong> are costs increase on a per-user basis. I mentioned earlier that these costs mean that software is actually rivalrous, meaning that at some point, the project won’t be able to support the n+1th user. Some of this cost comes from physical infrastructure like code hosting and infrastructure. However, the majority of the cost comes from user support. Say you have a billion users and only 0.1% of them require support. If it takes you roughly 10 minutes to resolve each issue, you would still need 20,833 people working 8-hour shifts a day just to be able to keep up with the support volume. Maintainers are constantly wrestling with keeping their issue volume low and questions answered. Eventually, it just becomes a hindrance preventing them from working on the core product.</p><p><strong>Temporal costs</strong> are those which build up and compound over time. Most of it comes from technical debt, choices that are easier today at the expense of time and money in the future. This is the eternal battle against entropy: the inevitable decay of systems over time. When code changes, all the supporting knowledge that surrounds it must be updated too. Documentation, tutorials, programming books, videos, and more slowly become obsolete.</p><p>Paying off these latent costs is seldom intrinsically motivated. When people talk about how fun making new projects is or contributing to open source, it’s never referring to writing documentation or refactoring code. This isn’t the ‘fun’ part of writing software. This is the nasty upkeep that goes into maintaining a building from the 1850s that’s had new rooms, plumbing, and electric wiring frankenstein-ed into it over the years.</p><h2 id="funding-open-source">Funding Open Source</h2><p>I first started on BentoML<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> as a casual contributor last summer, submitting a few decently sized PRs. It was almost all intrinsically motivated; I found issues that I enjoyed working on and that I knew I would learn lots from. Satisfied with my experience, I decided to join the team as a paid contractor expecting to just continue the type of work I was doing in the summer. As issue after issue piled on, I slowly started to realize just how much extra work being a maintainer meant and why it was a paid position. Making proposals, triaging issues, adding tests, and writing documentation took up the majority of my time. While I recognized it was important work, it was not work I was intrinsically motivated to do. Thus, to motivate people like me to get that work done, an extrinsic motivator – in this case, money – needed to be applied.</p><p>How do we best incentivize maintainers to work tasks stripped of the very excitement and promise of creation that initially drew them to the project in the first place? There is a jarring disconnect between work that is needed versus work that is intrinsically motivated. This is where I believe open source funding should play a role. There are two main potential avenues to go about this.</p><h3 id="funding-projects">Funding projects</h3><p>One possibility is to fund projects directly. This route builds a brand around the project. The status of the project then transcends any single person’s contributions and becomes a tangible entity …</p></div></div>

<p>We need new Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) for this new era of computing. We need a CAS that dispatches in the multiple ways we think. We need a CAS that scales exponentially like our problems. We need a CAS that integrates with our package ecosystem, letting people extend parts and contribute back to the core library all in one language. We need a modern CAS in a modern language.</p>
<p>Symbolics.jl is the answer. Symbolics.jl is a pure Julia CAS which uses the Julia core library to its fullest. It is built from the ground up with performance in mind. We use specialized structures for automatic simplification to match the performance of the most fully optimized C++ libraries. It exploits parallelism at every level; our symbolic simplification takes advantage of Julia's task-based multithreading to transform symbolic equations into parallelized Julia code.</p>
<p>This reconstruction of the idea of CAS in Julia's type system is entirely extensible. New term types enable fast symbolic arithmetic on standard and non-standard algebras; add-on libraries like ModelingToolkit build a bridge from symbolics to numerics. Symbolics.jl and its ecosystem will be the common foundation on which the next generation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) will be constructed, automatically updated and accelerated through with the growth of this system.</p>
<h2 id="the_features_of_symbolicsjl"><a href="#the_features_of_symbolicsjl">The Features of Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>Symbolics.jl at its launch in 2021 is already expansive. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symbolic arithmetic with type information and multiple dispatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic polynomials and trigonometric functions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pattern matching, simplification and substitution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Differentiation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic linear algebra (factorizations, inversion, determinants, eigencomputations, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discrete math (representations of summations, products, binomial coefficients, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logical and Boolean expressions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic equation solving and conversion to arbitrary precision</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for non-standard algebras (non-commutative symbols and customizable rulesets)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Special functions (list provided by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl">SpecialFunctions.jl</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatic conversion of Julia code to symbolic code</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generation of (high performance and parallel) functions from symbolic expressions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fast automated sparsity detection and generation of sparse Jacobian and Hessians</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more. A lot of these features are for free given its deep integration with multiple dispatch and Julia's type system.</p>
<h2 id="connection_to_the_package_ecosystem"><a href="#connection_to_the_package_ecosystem">Connection to the Package Ecosystem</a></h2>
<h3 id="the_connection_to_the_modelingtoolkitjl"><a href="#the_connection_to_the_modelingtoolkitjl">The Connection to the ModelingToolkit.jl</a></h3>
<p>Here in the Julia world, we like differntial equations, maybe a little too much.</p>
<p>Symbolics.jl grew out of ModelingToolkit.jl, an equation-based modeling system for the Julia programming language. Its vision is that the best system for modeling requires having the ability to symbolically specify models and build a library of transformations for generating more stable and performant code. While software in a similar space like Simulink and Modelica are disconnected from traditional programming languages and symbolic algebra systems, ModelingToolkit.jl weaves them together, allowing all aspects of the Julia programming language and symbolic computing to contribute to the richness of its design.</p>
<p>The ModelingToolkit.jl project has been almost too much of a success in that respect, reaching a feature-base that included an entire CAS as a submodule within itself. It was time for that CAS to be set free. Symbolics.jl is that CAS, now set in its own organization, JuliaSymbolics, with its ability to transform new domains.</p>
<p>ModelingToolkit.jl will continue to provide the symbolic representations of common numeric systems and the SciML organization, such as causal and acausal modeling (Simulink/Modelica) in the domains of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ordinary differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stochastic differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Partial differential equations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nonlinear systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimization problems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimal Control</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It will continue to power the connection the next generation of symbolic-numeric computation, blurring the boundaries by mixing analytical solutions with optimized and parallelized generated code. All symbolic functionality related to those domains will continue to thrive in that package, leaving Symbolics.jl the room to focus on the core of symbolic algebras: polynomials, Grobner bases, and more.</p>
<h3 id="the_connection_to_symbolicutilsjl"><a href="#the_connection_to_symbolicutilsjl">The Connection to SymbolicUtils.jl</a></h3>
<p>Symbolics.jl is an opinionated CAS. It types its variables so that generic Julia functions which require <code>Real</code> numbers can automatically be converted into symbolic expressions. It uses the Leibniz rules for defining derivatives. It does symbolic algebra as "the normal person would expect".</p>
<p>However, there are some use cases in computational algebra which require non-standard rulesets. How would you define symbolic Octonian numbers or define differentiation on non-smooth manifolds that do not satisfy the Leibniz rule? For these questions, mathematicians have traditionally been on their own having to develop new tools from scratch. However, the JuliaSymbolics has refactored its core so that new algebras can easily be implemented and created, and automatically get the optimized high performance of Symbolics.jl. This is SymbolicUtils.jl.</p>
<p>SymbolicUtils.jl is a fast and parallel rule-based rewrite system. By specifying a list of rules, such as trigonometric identities, you can specify new mathematical domains and create the symbolic arithmetic that you need. Symbolics.jl is built on this foundation, adding the common simplification rules for real numbers, derivative definitions and rules for Newton differentiation, and more. However, if you're so inclined, SymbolicUtils.jl is open for you to define BraKet algebras and more.</p>
<h2 id="goals_for_symbolicsjl"><a href="#goals_for_symbolicsjl">Goals for Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>Symbolics.jl will be a never ending project as we wish to provide a high performance implementation of every symbolic algorithm that can and does exist. But, there are specific goals we have in mind.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance_symbolic_arithmetic"><a href="#high-performance_symbolic_arithmetic">High-Performance Symbolic Arithmetic</a></h3>
<p>Anywhere that we are beat in performance is a bug. Please file an issue immediately. This library should use every core, and it should use every core efficiently, allowing the exponential cost of symbolic arithmetic to tackled by the exponential gains in computational power and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="pervasiveness_throughout_the_julia_dsls"><a href="#pervasiveness_throughout_the_julia_dsls">Pervasiveness Throughout the Julia DSLs</a></h3>
<p>We want to provide a symbolic foundation which all DSLs can rely on. We do not believe that a pharmacometrics library should define how to symbolically calculate a Hessian, and then the mathematical programming library JuMP, etc. We believe that by pooling together on Symbolics.jl, we can accelerate the growth of DSLs throughout the language, offering a way to collaborate towards a single battletested implementation.</p>
<h3 id="bridge_the_gap_from_computer_scientists_to_scientists_and_mathematicans"><a href="#bridge_the_gap_from_computer_scientists_to_scientists_and_mathematicans">Bridge the Gap from Computer Scientists to Scientists and Mathematicans</a></h3>
<p>While "code" is what package developers like to see, math is what practioners are trained on. We are committed to bridging that gap, making it easy to see the LaTeX-ification of the symbolic variables, creating informative displays in notebooks. Symbolics.jl should look and feel like doing math.</p>
<h3 id="feature_completeness"><a href="#feature_completeness">Feature Completeness</a></h3>
<p>We want Symbolics.jl to be the place where you check the documentation immediately for symbolic methods, knowing that if such a method exists then it's implemented there. Symbolics.jl should not just cover the domain but also be an archive of its research and science, making it easy to explore algorithms and compare between them.</p>
<h2 id="next_steps_for_symbolicsjl"><a href="#next_steps_for_symbolicsjl">Next Steps for Symbolics.jl</a></h2>
<p>We have not met all of our goals yet. While much of this roadmap has been accomplished, there is much in our way forward. Some major goals on our sights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symbolic integration using <a href="https://rulebasedintegration.org/">RUBI</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Expansive algorithm selection for Grobner Basis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feature parity with SymPy (<a href="https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl/issues/59">being tracked here</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integration with distributed and GPU computation</p>
</li>
<li><p>High performance symbolic root finding</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrating modern techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01412.pdf">deep learning to accelerate and improve symbolic rule application</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Tools for <a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org/">transforming generated equations to have minimal floating point error</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>A full reproducible benchmarking suite</p>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This is the story of a hack.</p>
<p>It's not anything <em>wrong</em> or <em>bad</em>. It works quite well, but it just has that... quality. The one where you see it and you laugh in amused disgust.</p>
<p>This is the story of how I made python do regexes when it shouldn't do regexes.</p>
<div id="the-motive">
<h2>The motive</h2>
<p>I've blogged about littlecheck before. It's fish's script test driver <a href="#id6" id="id1">[1]</a>. The way it works is that you write a script, and then you write the output you expect into <tt># CHECK:</tt> comments inside the script.</p>
<p>Littlecheck then lets whatever interpreter you picked run the script and compares its output to all the <tt># CHECK:</tt> lines. This is super simple and works quite well in practice. Here's an example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>echo</span> Hello!
<span># CHECK: Hello!</span>

<span>echo</span> Goodbye
<span># CHECK: Goodbye</span>

<span>echo</span> No check <span>for</span> this
<span># ^^ Oh no, that one will fail.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Only... when things went wrong, littlecheck did this naive comparison where it complained about the first line that was wrong, and then let you figure out the context of all of that.</p>
<p>Was it a superfluous line of output? A <tt># CHECK</tt> too many? Or actually a line that was different from what was expected?</p>
<p>It didn't tell you. It just said "this line doesn't look like this CHECK on line XYZ, also here's the rest of the output".</p>
<p>Now, if you've been around unix a few times, you might know what this is a problem for: diff!</p>
<p>You have a bunch of lines on one side, a bunch on the other and you want to know what the <strong>diff</strong>-erence is between the two, so you run <tt>diff</tt> on them!</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you would. Only there's a problem: Littlecheck does regexes.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-means">
<h2>The Means</h2>
<p>The venerable <tt>diff</tt> utility doesn't handle regexes, and we wouldn't want to launch it anyway <a href="#id7" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>But Littlecheck is written in python, and that has a lot of stuff in the standard library. Maybe there's a diffing tool?</p>
<p>Oh, there's a <tt>difflib</tt>. Cool!</p>
<p>And python can do regexes - that's what we use to match them in the first place. So let's just pass a comparator to the "SequenceMatcher" thing and be done with it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>difflib's <tt>SequenceMatcher</tt> doesn't take a comparator function, or key, or something comparable (hah!) <a href="#id8" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-opportunity">
<h2>The Opportunity</h2>
<p>Where we're going we don't need comparator functions.</p>
<p>It turns out SequenceMatcher takes its arguments as a list. So how about instead of passing strings we pass the regex objects? No, that won't work because the other side is still strings, so when it compares the two it'll just always be false.</p>
<p>So what if we overload the list's <tt>__contains__</tt> function? Well, no, that won't work because SequenceMatcher takes the list and puts the elements into a dictionary <a href="#id9" id="id4">[4]</a> that we don't control.</p>
<p>So... how about we override the equality operator? Well, not quite. Since it's a dictionary it first tries hash comparisons. Luckily, that goes via the <tt>__hash__</tt> function, so I can write the most awful python I have ever written:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>__hash__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Chosen by fair diceroll</span>
    <span># No, just kidding.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This makes the hash comparison always collide, so whenever python checks if something is <tt>in</tt> the dictionary it'll have to take the long route and do an actual comparison. After that, we hack the <tt>__eq__</tt> function to do a regex match:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>__eq__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>other</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>,</span> <span>CheckCmd</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>other</span><span>.</span><span>regex</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>,</span> <span>Line</span><span>):</span>
        <span># We only compare the text here so SequenceMatcher can reshuffle these</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>text</span> <span>==</span> <span>other</span><span>.</span><span>text</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span>
</pre></div>
<p>From there it's smooth sailing putting lipstick on this pig... boat <a href="#id10" id="id5">[5]</a>, and this is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Example output. It shows that Littlecheck can identify errors somewhere in the middle without misinterpreting everything after." src="https://bean.solutions/img/littlecheck-diff.png"></p><p>And that's the way I like it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h4 id="mar-1-2021"><a href="#mar-1-2021">#</a> Mar 1, 2021</h4> <p>One of my most-used (and personal favourite) Python packages <code>pytest</code> tweeted the question recently:</p> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What convinced you that writing tests was worthwhile?</p>— pytest.org (@pytestdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/pytestdotorg/status/1365417272219557890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2021</a></blockquote>  <p>The more common responses to this are typically along the lines of:</p> <ul><li>Tests enable us to make changes with confidence,</li> <li>Tests allow us to verify something new works as expected,</li> <li>Tests help us collaborate more effectively.</li></ul> <p>Most of us will have at least some professional experience that informs our held beliefs and opinions regarding software practice, including those that cover software testing. Speaking personally, my philosophy toward writing tests has been directly informed by experiences where testing would have saved time and sanity when dealing with a tricky bug, regression, or outage.</p> <p>Specifically on the last bullet re: collaboration, I'll admit this wasn't immediately obvious to me when I first started writing code in teams. Nowadays, I'm so convinced of this that I'd consider it a specific interest in my work as an engineer.</p> <h3 id="tests-for-collaboration"><a href="#tests-for-collaboration">#</a> Tests for collaboration</h3> <p>As a new start, or as a developer who hasn't worked on a particular project before, one of the first steps towards productivity is running a checkout locally and ensuring the tests pass. I'll often end up in the test suite fairly soon afterwads having a dig around too. There's a few tacit things that this achieves:</p> <ul><li>It draws a line in the sand from which contributions can begin,</li> <li>It (mostly) can ensure consistency across development environments,</li> <li>It often enables developers to understand the code quicker.</li></ul> <p>Well-written tests can communicate what's happening under the hood on some of the more complex aspects of your codebase. Tests <em>can</em> be leveraged to resemble documentation, but I've found even simply stepping-through a test example with a debugger can be the most effective way to understand a particularly tricky area I might be having some difficulty grokking.</p> <p>A great side effect of all this is in distributing the ownership of code. If there's a decent level of test coverage, I'm much more likely to be able to figure out what's going on and ship changes or fixes quicker as a less experienced contributor. This helps mitigate against individuals being the <em>go-to</em> for specific parts of the stack: a scenario that can grind progress to a halt.</p> <p>The good developer experiences I've had working on high quality codebases has led me to think a bit more deeply about areas where these practices might help elsewhere.</p> <h3 id="testing-and-data-science-features"><a href="#testing-and-data-science-features">#</a> Testing and data science features</h3> <p>I've been working either as or closely with data scientists for the past decade or so, and I'm a firm believer in high quality and testing when working with data-driven components. These are complex bits of kit — even a simple "heuristic" data science feature can be awkward to track regressions with in scenarios where there are multiple contributors and the development pace is quick. That's before we even consider some of the more heavyweight approaches in the machine learning space.</p> <p>The train-test cycle is already central to the process of constructing models and algorithms, but what about after this point? What's going on when we take the approach from the workbench of a Jupyter Notebook, and integrate it into a production context?</p> <p>There's some great material out there regarding tests and data science — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da-FL_1i6ps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing unit tests<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> as a first class contributions, to <a href="http://www.tdda.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrating testing practice<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> right from the get-go in your data analysis workflow. It's a rapidly maturing area that we're all learning in — another excellent example of this can be seen in the broader move towards best practices with communities like <a href="https://mlops.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLOps<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a>.</p> <p>I'm interested in how we can begin to build tests when shipping data-driven components that help with collaboration in teams — <strong>especially</strong> in those scenarios where not every contributor is necessarily a data science expert. Being able to demonstrate fitness and validation on each phase of a continuous integration pipeline, on each local build, or after each boilerplate or model-specific change is something that allows developers to remain confident dealing with these components.</p> <h3 id="introducing-hypervector"><a href="#introducing-hypervector">#</a> Introducing Hypervector</h3> <p>Constructing tests for a function or feature that relies on the empirical aspects of the data science development process can become a little more tricky than writing assertions elsewhere. Take a feature vector of <code>N</code> values — there's a multiplicity of valid input combinations that could be encountered. Generating, managing, and sharing test data for these across different contexts is often a cumbersome process.</p> <p>With this in mind, I'm currently focused on building tools that help this process with <a href="https://hypervector.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypervector<span> <span>(opens new window)</span></span></a> — a testing and validation API specifically for generating data-driven tests to maintain confidence and improve observability for your data-driven features.</p> <p><a href="https://hypervector.io/"><img src="https://jsnctl.github.io/blog/tests/hypervector.png" width="30%"></a></p> <p>Hypervector allows you to:</p> <ul><li>Build Ensembles of data-driven test cases,</li> <li>Retrieve test data via a canonical endpoint wherever it's required,</li> <li>Define Benchmarks of expected behaviour,</li> <li>Assert results are consistent, or flag diffs for investigation</li></ul> <p>all via the API directly, or with the <code>hypervector-wrapper</code> Python package.</p> <div><pre><code># definition.json

Instantaneous and free updates to your decentralized website.
</center>
<p>When you publish a website from Peergos, you can view it through any Peergos gateway. We're running one at <tt>peergos.me</tt>, so your website will be available at <tt>https://&lt;your-user-name&gt;.peergos.me</tt>, and viewable in any browser today. Bear in mind that viewing through a public gateway like that still relies on DNS and the TLS certificate authorities, which are both single points of failure that are vulnerable to attack. However, we can actually get around both of these by viewing someone's site through a local Peergos gateway. To visit someone's site in this way, you just run a local Peergos instance and browse to <tt>http://&lt;username&gt;.peergos.localhost:9000</tt>. The gateway looks up the public key of the username provided in the localhost subdomain via the Peergos PKI, then retrieves the website and serves it. All this is done without relying on DNS or TLS certificates anywhere. We are thus able to use localhost subdomains to achieve isolation and security between different sites served from one local gateway. </p>
<p>Websites hosted on Peergos benefit from our resilient and reliable decentralized architecture. Most of the heavy lifting is done by <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> through content addressing and public key based routing. With our architecture, we add fast mutable pointers and human-readable names. Therefore, you can trust that the content of your website will be readily available without having to rely on a single-point-of-failure-server anywhere. </p>
<p>In the future, we will enable viewing such websites directly inside the Peergos web interface. At that point, Peergos will really start to look like a new web.</p>
<p>There are still a few free accounts available on <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a>. Let us know what you think. We're always looking for feedback, so either <a href="mailto://peergos@peergos.org">drop us a line</a> or come say hi in our <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#peergos-chat:matrix.org">Matrix chatroom</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for introductions to a few other new features and apps we're building as part of our <a href="https://peergos.org/posts/next-generation-internet">grant</a> from the Next Generation Internet program (<a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI POINTER</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Ab dem 1. März 2021 stellt das Bundesamt für Landestopografie swisstopo seine amtlichen digitalen Daten und Dienste online kostenlos zur Verfügung. Damit schafft swisstopo für innovative Unternehmen, Privatpersonen und Organisationen neue Möglichkeiten, um Informationsdienstleistungen zu entwickeln. Die bisherigen Beschaffungskosten und Nutzungsgebühren fallen weg. Diese Öffnung der Daten ist Teil der im November 2018 vom Bundesrat verabschiedeten «Strategie für offene Verwaltungsdaten in der Schweiz 2019  ̶  2023».</p><div>


<div>
    
	
	
	

    
    <div>
        
        <p>Künftig werden alle digitalen Standardprodukte von swisstopo, wie beispielsweise die digitalen Landeskarten, Luftbilder, Landschaftsmodelle oder geologische Vektordaten, kostenlos als Open Government Data (OGD) zur Verfügung gestellt. Sie können kostenlos genutzt, weiterverteilt und wiederverwendet werden. Ausser einer Quellenangabe ist keine Genehmigung mehr erforderlich. Auch einer kommerziellen Nutzung steht nichts im Weg.</p>
<p><b>Ein Beitrag zur digitalen Transformation<br>
 </b>Die für diese Öffnung erforderliche Verordnungsänderungen hat der Bundesrat am 4. April 2020 beschlossen und auf den 1. März 2021 in Kraft gesetzt. Der Bundesrat verfolgt damit das Ziel einer noch breiteren Nutzung der Geoinformationen. Zudem gehört diese Öffnung zur «Strategie für offene Verwaltungsdaten in der Schweiz 2019 ̶ 2023», die der Bundesrat im Herbst 2018 verabschiedet hatte.</p>
<p>Die digitalen Geodaten von swisstopo richten sich in erster Linie an professionelle Anwenderinnen und Anwender. Für Ingenieure, Architekten, Programmierer oder Planer aber auch für die Forschung und Wissenschaft wird der Zugang zu den amtlichen Geodaten, die nach den Grundsätzen von OGD abgegeben werden, einfacher. Der Anreiz zur Entwicklung von neuen Informationsdienstleistungen wird grösser. Dadurch kann swisstopo einen aktiven Beitrag für Innovation und wirtschaftliches Wachstum leisten und gleichzeitig die digitale Transformation in der Schweiz unterstützen.</p>
<p><b>Möglichst einfacher Zugang zu den Daten<br>
 </b>Die meisten Geobasisdaten von swisstopo sind so bereitgestellt, dass sie von den Nutzerinnen und Nutzern selbständig vom Internet heruntergeladen oder mittels Geodienste online genutzt werden können. Jeder Datensatz wird mit dem aktuellen Zeitstand und in den am meisten nachgefragten Formaten und Varianten angeboten. Für den Download der Daten oder die Nutzung der Geodienste ist keine Registrierung erforderlich. Einige ältere oder besonders grosse Bestände an Fachgeodaten wie beispielsweise Luftbildstreifen oder historische Karten stehen nicht zum Download zur Verfügung. Diese können bei <a href="mailto:geodata@swisstopo.ch">geodata@swisstopo.ch</a> bestellt werden, wobei die Kosten für die Bereitstellung der Daten verrechnet werden. Die Nutzung ist selbstverständlich kostenlos.</p>
<div><p>Da die swisstopo-Geodaten in maschinenlesbarer Form vorliegen, können sie einfach in digitale Prozesse eingebunden werden. So kann ein Unternehmen beispielsweise mittels Programmierschnittstellen eine regelmässige und automatische Aktualisierung von digitalen Landeskarten für ihr geografisches Informationssystem einrichten.</p></div>

<h2>Evolution of AI</h2>
<p>Alongside the rapid growth of YouTube’s popularity is AI innovation. One particular company that is gaining a lot of attention is Elon Musk-backed <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, I was fortunate enough to join their private beta program. So very quickly, I decided to try something I have wanted to do with <a href="https://recorank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecoRank</a> for some time: automated YouTube video review analysis using AI.</p>
<p>I’m a huge MKBHD fan. And as one of the top YouTube video reviewers, I tried using OpenAI to summarize his video review transcripts.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHDtldr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The results have been amazing so far.</a></p>

<h2>Achieving These Results</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1: Extract Transcripts</strong></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

subtitles = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript("dhAmMXCBIcg")

sub_list = []

for subtitle in subtitles:
    sub_list.append(subtitle['text'])

txt = " ".join(sub_list)

print(txt)</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple Python script using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">YouTubeTranscriptApi</a> quickly gets you the transcript of any YouTube video - given that the video has a transcript. The API will produce an error if one does not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Summarize with OpenAI</strong></p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="openai" title="openai" src="https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/07484/openai.png" srcset="https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/d76be/openai.png 135w,
https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/01bf6/openai.png 270w,
https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/07484/openai.png 540w,
https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/d7542/openai.png 810w,
https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/302a4/openai.png 1080w,
https://tavis.cc/static/5a02c1c4a0662c4d79c523faba3f6a21/d9ed5/openai.png 2880w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px">
    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>I used OpenAI’s <code>tl;dr:</code> (too long; didn’t read) function to achieve AI-generated transcript summaries.</p>
<p>On top of the default settings, I also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set temperature to <code>0</code> to exclude any improvisation of the results and get the summary with no guesswork</li>
<li>Added <code>The [product name]</code> right after <code>tl;dr:</code> to guide OpenAI on what I wanted (i.e. <code>The iPhone 12 is a great phone, but it's not a huge leap forward.</code> - I didn’t do this for all summaries, but I did find that this method delivered the most consistent results than just using <code>tl;dr</code> on its own)</li>
<li>Deleted enough of the start of the transcript to fit within the 2048 token limit (in the case with most reviews, more of the meat is at the end than the beginning, particularly final thoughts)</li>
<li>Added a return break <code>⏎</code> as a Stop Sequence to limit the results to one paragraph</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>These are just the results of one week of experimentation with OpenAI. Pros and cons are other areas to explore.</p>
<p>These are the pros and cons results for MKBHD’s Samsung Galaxy S21 review:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Pros:
– Great display
– Great performance
– Great cameras
– Great battery life
– Great design
– Great value

Cons:
– No expandable storage
– No MST
– No S Pen
– No wireless charging</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m hoping to add these insights to <a href="https://recorank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RecoRank</a> soon.</p>
<p>My friend Adrian Krebs has a <a href="https://www.buyforlife.com/blog/548RijnkRdPwn1cAI5RDjw/make-better-and-faster-purchasing-decisions-with-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about his trials in this area for his business, <a href="https://buyforlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuyForLife.com</a>. Definitely worth a read.</p>
<p>Have an idea of how OpenAI could be applied for review analysis and summarization? I’d love to hear from you. Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/tavislochhead" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> or send me an email @ tavislochhead [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com.</p></div><p><img src="https://tavis.cc/static/headshot-37e68c3c90409f03180397ce570be16e.jpeg" alt="profile pic"><strong><a href="https://tavis.cc/about">Tavis Lochhead</a></strong> <!-- -->is a seasoned marketer who loves tech and data.

                <div><p>
                    First of all, I hope the title isn't too catchy or misleading. There are no magic secrets here, actually, it's all pretty common stuff for anyone that has some experience with any DBMS. But that is, in itself, part of point of this article: that sometimes the basic stuff can be overlooked. </p><p>

<i>(Editorial note: For privacy reasons I changed the names of several things in order to keep the client identity and industry as less-evident as possible)</i></p><p>

I won a contract to build a platform for a client. This was to be used internally but also as a way for the client's clients to access and analyze data. They had a pretty old platform in place that was aging quite fast and lacked useful features. So they hired a company to get them a more modern platform with a flashy UI. Unfortunately, this company didn't build anything new, rather they used something they already had and made lots of tweaks here and there to try and fit a round peg in a square hole. The end product was interesting at first, but in a short period of time it began to show its weaknesses. So again the need came to actually get something built from the ground up that met the needs of the present and was ready for the future. This is when I come in. </p><p>

The main table of the database holds millions and millions of rows. Although the users are not that many, the amount of data being stored every hour is huge. This means the database grows a couple of Gb every single month. But the main problem of the database was not the storage space it needed - I was told - but that it was so big that needed to be as performant as possible.  </p><p>

The main queries that are done, which retrieve data to be analyzed or compared over spans of time, could take anywhere from 30 to 180seconds, depending on the time span of the query. You read that right, seconds. It was painful to use it. </p><p>

Because they were still maintaining the old platform plus the current one, they had a mixture of MySQL and Postgres running. When I proposed to get a fresh start and merge everything together in just one MySQL database I felt some doubts were raised as if I really knew what I was doing. After all, when performance is an issue postgres is the answer. Right? Not necessarily! </p><p>

<b>Step 1 – Actually utilize the resources you have</b></p><p>

Early on in the development process I got access to the current server so I could look at how things were running. The server had a nice 24Gb of RAM, a recent upgrade was done (I was told) from 16Gb, in order to try and improve things. There was so much of stuff being ran at the same time for this platform to work! I never got to understand properly the whole architecture of it but there was a lot of java everywhere. In spite of the RAM increase, there was no noticeable difference in performance. </p><p>

Upon some looking here and there, I noticed that about 90% of the RAM was free. Does that mean that the recent upgrade was totally mislead and unnecessary? Yes, it does! </p><p>

Worse than that, I ended up finding out that the company that installed the server and platform didn't even bother to do a proper setup of the MySql server. That means that it was using default values! For instance, <b>innodb buffer pool size</b> was 128Mb! No one wonder MySql wasn't touching all that available RAM. It was basically a very costly and nonsense server upgrade. Mainly because the server doesn't even get that many requests .</p><p>

<b>Step 2 – Can you believe it?</b></p><p>

I got a partial dump of the database so that I could run some tests on my dev machine. I had the queries that were run most of the time, in order to make sure I was targeting a good performance increase. </p><p>

On my machine I could get slightly faster query results, but still in the order of about 1min, on average. </p><p>

My second shock of horror was when I discover that this table that holds all the important data had the usual auto-incremented primary key, but no indexes whatsoever. No wonder the queries were taking too long! </p><p>

The queries were most of the time something similar to  </p><p>

<b>SELECT [cols...] FROM [datatable] WHERE user_id = ? AND location_id = ? AND datestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?</b><br>
This was the way to fetch all relevant data from a specific location, from a user, during a span of time. But sometimes, for another kind of analysis, it would drop the location and filter only by user and datetime. </p><p>

The priority for using an index was then <b>User_id 🠖 datestamp 🠖 location_id</b></p><p>

Of course you can create an index for all of these columns, but in a table this big it is also important to keep in mind that indexes can take up a lot of space so you don't want too many of them. </p><p>

I ended up creating a composite index, taking into consideration the priority above and that MySql uses the keys from left to right. </p><p>

That means if the index is <b>[user_id, location_id, datestamp]</b> but location_id is not part of the query, then MySql won't be able to use this index even if datestamp is part of the query. </p><p>

The composite index ended up as <b>[user_id, datestamp, location_id]</b> which is somewhat complex but is able to match exactly the kind of queries the platform needs to do. In the event of wanting to retrieve all data from a user in a certain span of time (ignoring location_id), MySql can ignore the last key because it is on the right side of the index. And because data is never fetched without specifying a clear time period, the first two keys are always used. </p><p>
 
After changing the table accordingly I ran a couple of tests with some of the most demanding queries. Data was now fetched always under 1 second! It was like night and day. </p><p>

I decided to give this a try in a very weak server. I created a new VPS in Digital Ocean and opted from the lowest of the lowest: 1vCPU, 1Gb Ram. Actually faced some troubles to get npm to work due to memory constraints (sigh), but after that was done, everything was still blazing fast. </p><p>

This was only used for demos and eventually the client created their own new VPS to host the new platform once it was done, at a 90% reduced yearly-cost, compared to the current one.  </p><p>

So this is my lesson learnt, coming straight from the trenches: never overlook the simple stuff, and never think that others have done the simple stuff too!</p><p>

<b>So, to conclude</b><br>
- Don't assume the basics have been taking into consideration when you are handling work done by someone else<br>
- Check all the default values and adjust accordingly to your server and needs<br>
- Plan your indexes according to the queries you are supposed to execute

		<p><span>TL;DR:</span> Ada is an extremely interesting and robust programming language that has a lot to offer modern developers of system 
	and bare-metal software. At very least, Ada presents many interesting ideas that designers of modern programming languages could stand to learn much from. If you want a 30 second version of this article, check out the 
	<a href="#practical_example">practical example</a> that I provide for a comparison of Ada with C.</p>

<p>
	Much of the technical material presented in this article is available as part of <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Ajxs">my contributions</a> to <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">osdev.org</a>
</p>
<p>
	I consider myself a rational man. While I may believe in an entirely deterministic model of the universe, I certainly
	do not believe it to be guided by any conscious process.
	I do not believe in destiny. This absence of guidance makes such fortuitous occurrences as the one I will discuss all
	the more extraordinary, and for this I am all the more grateful.
</p>

<h2>A Chance Collision</h2>
<p>
	By no deliberate design of my own, I happen to live close to a university. Not in the kind of ‘University town’ common
	to much of Europe or the United States, but in the densely packed suburban sprawl of the inner-city. My regular walk
	to and from the local shopping centre takes me past several of the buildings belonging to the highly regarded
	engineering faculty of the aforementioned University.
</p>
<p>
	Making my way home one serendipitous afternoon, I happened across a sizeable stack of books sitting on the curb
	outside one of the University’s engineering buildings. The university was ostensibly in the process of liquidating its stockpile
	of old engineering books, and had left them in a pile for the local council to collect. Amongst material covering a
	wide variety of academic disciplines, two books in particular caught my eye: <i>Building Parallel, Embedded, and
	Real-Time Applications with Ada</i>, and <i>Concurrent and Real-Time Programming in Ada</i>.
</p>
<p>
	I had heard of Ada before. I understood that it came from a pedigree of languages developed for the United States
	military, and that it still occupied a niche in the development of safety-critical applications, nothing more.
	Curious, I threw the books in my bag and off I went.
</p>


<h2>Exceeding My Expectations</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I had pictured Ada’s syntax resembling the uncompromising verbosity and rigid construction of COBOL, or
	perhaps the Lovecraftian hieroglyphics of Fortran’s various eldritch incarnations. Turning the pages, I was pleasantly
	surprised by modern constructs associated with modern high-level languages such as ranges, slicing and
	exception-handling. The syntax — Admittedly verbose by modern standards<sup><a href="#footnote_3">3</a></sup> — seemed deliberately and purposefully
	constructed to make the language comprehensible at a glance.</p>
<p>The fact that Ada was designed with embedded-software in mind was of particular interest to me. I already had some
	limited experience with bare-metal development on the x86 and ARM platforms using C and assembly, so the prospect of
	using higher-level constructs on bare-metal seemed promising to me.</p>

<h2>Not the Camel You Expected</h2>
<p>A common pejorative refrain directed at Ada by its many detractors is that it is a language “designed by committee”,
	or even worse, a language “designed by committee <i>for the military</i>”<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. The implication of which being that (so-called)
	design by committee precludes it from any real-world practicality. I contend that it is better to design a language to fit an
	existing problem domain than to pick your weapon of choice and set out in search of new problem domains to apply it
	to<sup><a href="#footnote_2">2</a></sup>. I will spare readers a detailed retelling of Ada’s conception within the Department of Defence’s <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/history/holwg-93/holwg-93.htm">‘High Order
	Language Working Group’</a>, save to say that the Ada programming language was born of the need for single, unified
	higher-level language suitable for use in the multitude of Real-Time Embedded systems developed by the DoD<sup><a href="#footnote_4">4</a></sup>. In the
	wise words of the working-group’s chair, Colonel William A. Whitaker: “It was concluded that no existing language
	could be adopted as a single common high order language for the DoD, but that a single language meeting essentially
	all the requirements was both feasible and desirable.”. If such a thing was indeed feasible, the DoD’s deep pockets
	would help it bring it into existence. Ironically, given its status as the de-facto standard language of modern embedded-system development, the C language was considered unsuitable for this purpose: “When Bell Labs were
	invited to evaluate C against the DoD requirements, they said that there was no chance of C meeting the requirements
	of readability, safety, etc.” (Whitaker, 1993). After its successful implementation, in what would prove a controversial decision, the DoD would go so far as to mandate 
	the use of Ada for all in-house software engineering.</p>

<h2>So What Makes It Special?</h2>
<p>
	Ada has many useful features that are of particular interest for low-level programming and operating-system development. One
	feature in particular that impressed me greatly was Ada’s <i>representation clauses</i> (see below). They provide a highly granular way to define the
	in-memory representation of low-level data structures. I was very quickly able to adapt my own long suffering operating-system development project to Ada, improving the
	quality of my codebase greatly in the process. The following section details some of Ada’s features:
</p>

<h3>Custom Types</h3>
<p>
	In addition to being a strongly typed language, Ada allows for the definition of new scalar, enumerated and record types.
	Custom primitive types can also be constrained to a predefined range of values.
	The example below demonstrates the definition of a new integer type based upon Ada’s native <code>Natural</code> type, restricted
	to a predefined range.
	The use of the subtype directive informs the compiler that other variables of the <code>Natural</code> type are compatible with
	the newly defined subtype.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
<span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>24</span><span>;</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Col</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_COL_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>subtype</span> <span>Row</span> <span>is</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>VGA_ROW_COUNT</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The below example illustrates the creation of incompatible custom integer types. While their base type and range
	constraints are identical, Ada treats both as separate, incompatible types. An assignment of a variable of one type
	to the value of another is illegal, and will trigger a compile-time error.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>is</span> <span>range</span> <span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>A</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_1</span> <span>:=</span> <span>8</span><span>;</span>
<span>B</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer_2</span> <span>:=</span> <span>A</span><span>;</span> <span>-- illegal!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The following example demonstrates the creation of a custom enumerated type. It also demonstrates a subtype of an enumerated type with a constrained range of values.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span><span>Monday</span><span>,</span> <span>Tuesday</span><span>,</span>
  <span>Wednesday</span><span>,</span> <span>Thursday</span><span>,</span> <span>Friday</span><span>,</span> <span>Saturday</span><span>,</span> <span>Sunday</span><span>);</span>

<span>subtype</span> <span>Work_Day</span> <span>is</span> <span>Day_Of_Week</span> <span>range</span> <span>Monday</span> <span>..</span> <span>Friday</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	A variable with the type of <code>Work_Day</code> is restricted to its constrained range. Any attempt to assign a value outside
	of this range to a variable of this type will raise a <code>Constraint_Error</code> exception at runtime.
</p>

<h2>Representation Clauses</h2>
<p>
	Ada allows for explicitly defining the in-memory representation of scalar and compound types. The following example
	demonstrates the definition of a record type (equivalent to structures in C), as well as its associated
	representation in memory.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The format of the System Table Descriptor pointer used by the processor</span>
<span>--  to load descriptor tables like the GDT and IDT.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>is</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>:</span> <span>Unsigned_16</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>:</span> <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Address</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end record</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>48</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>System_Table_Descriptor</span> <span>use</span>
   <span>record</span>
      <span>Size</span>   <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>0</span>  <span>..</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Offset</span> <span>at</span> <span>0</span> <span>range</span> <span>16</span> <span>..</span> <span>47</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>record</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>System_Table_Descriptor</code> type must be 48 bits in size. The
	record representation clause instructs the compiler as to the required layout of this record type in memory. This
	example specifies that the <code>Size</code> member should occupy bits 0 to 15, and the <code>Offset</code> member should occupy bits 16 to
	47. This feature is analogous to C’s bit-fields. The following example demonstrates defining the in-memory
	representation of an enumerated type.
</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>--  The privilege level for a particular descriptor.</span>
<span>--  These correspond to the 'protection ring' that this descriptor is</span>
<span>--  accessible from.</span>
<span>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>is</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>with</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</span> <span>use</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>Ring_0</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_1</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_2</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Ring_3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>3</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
	The <code>Size</code> aspect specifier instructs the compiler that the <code>Descriptor_Privilege_Level</code> type must be 2 bits in size.
	The representation clause instructs the compiler as to required representation of each possible value of the
	enumerated type in memory. In this example the value of <code>Ring_0</code> will be represented by a value of <code>0x0</code> in memory, the
	value of <code>Ring_1</code> will be represented by <code>0x1</code>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	The following example, and accompanying comparison with C, demonstrates the configuration of a hypothetical UART device by interfacing with an 8-bit memory-mapped configuration register.

<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Sometimes you do your best to get your web application ready in time and you actually do, but then you are challenged by its performance. It works, but it takes time to respond, it challenges the user’s patience, meaning, that’s a problem you need to take care of. The question is, how do you get around that?</p>
<p>There are different techniques that help us get around this and I’m writing this article to share my experience with the few I know and have tried, but, before we dive into the techniques pool, Let me state that this article is not meant to be the “definitive guide of web applications navigation speed optimizations” and it doesn’t also cover back-end specific optimization techniques.</p>
<p>Shall we begin?</p>
<h3>Http Resources caching</h3>
<p>The web sits on top of the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol is <strong>Request-Response</strong> based, where Requests and Responses have<strong> headers</strong> and <strong>content</strong>. Headers are used to pass meta-data and trigger certain behaviour, both on the server and client-side. So headers present in a Http request are read and interpreted by the server and headers present in a Http response are read and interpreted by the client. There is something very peculiar to be told about Http headers, is that, they must be sent before the content. Why? because as we said before they serve as some sort of meta-data or behaviour triggers regarding the HTTP content.</p>
<p><em>HTTP Caching is implemented via HTTP headers</em>. We basically add a few headers to the HTTP Response and tell the browser that it must cache the HTTP Response for a specific period.</p>
<p>The thing about the HTTP caching is that it caches data on the client-side (a browser most of the times) and it does require the client to make contact to the server in the first time, so it improves further requests, the initial load requests still not optimized by this technique. There is another peculiarity regarding this method: <em>how do you update content that was cached on the client-side?</em></p>
<h3>Versioned resources</h3>
<p>Let me describe the problem once again so that I can be sure we are both in the same boat: <strong>we want the client to cache content and avoid trips (requests) to the server, but at the same time, we want to have control over that same cached content</strong>. <em>What do I mean by “control”</em>? I mean: How do we update the cached content? Lets first dive into “how the whole caching thing works”. The client makes an initial GET request to the server and the server replies with the page content. The page content has references to other resources like scripts, style sheets and images. So, the client makes another GET requests in order to retrieve the referenced resources and that’s where the caching kicks in: before the client contact the server to retrieve the resource, it checks if the resource is not cached. This verification is based on the resource’s path. The path is our key to control the content cached on the client side. We just need to use a dynamic path. Because, once we change the path, even if it’s a minimum difference, the client will have to contact the server and retrieve the last version of the resource. You don’t need to be renaming the resource file. You can make the URL dynamic by adding a prefix or suffix to it and making such suffix change on each build of your application. I’m sure <strong>webpack</strong> can help you on this.</p>
<h3>Server output caching</h3>
<p>Web applications are pages with dynamic content, in other words: dynamically generated HTML. There currently two approaches to build web pages with dynamic content. Or we trust the browser (a JavaScript enabled one) to make the content dynamic by simply going to the server to fetch JSON data then perform DOM manipulation using JavaScript – a.k.a AJAX OOOOR we can go Naïve and let the server provide the full HTML . This technique is best suited to situations where full HTML is Being fetched from sever. But why? Because it has more enhancement impact in such situations. HTML is a lot more verbose than JSON, plus, generating HTML on the server side will likely involve a trip to a data source plus template engine processing, which means fetching JSON is in theory faster than fetching full HTML. Server output caching is to store the HTML generated by the server on a caching storage so that the it can be served the next time the page is requested. Let’s make a little sketch on this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202232%201312'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG8X9huNm1FFw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520236761939?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=WnhnlbREZwoVtEKyD2wpNf--3z2OuW6YC5Ld4kNouuE" width="2232" height="1312"></p>
<p>Seems awesome right? But there is a non answered question yet: when is the cache going to be updated? <strong>Adding an output caching layer creates the possibility of displaying out of date content to users.</strong></p>
<h4>Cache invalidation</h4>
<p>The path to find the right cache invalidation approach is to ask yourself the following question: Where is the data that is making your HTML dynamic, coming from? Most of the times, the answer for this question will be: a database. But it doesn’t matter the answer. The point is that you must invalidate a cached page when the data that was used to generate that page is updated. When I say “when the data is updated”, I mean it. It has to be right on the moment if you don’t want to be serving pages with out of dated content. You will need some messaging or event system to address this. You will end up with a design like this one:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202232%201253'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFLdE9r3UMKUQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1520508894649?e=1619654400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=I6ZzZPFuBXIYGF_3KYz1EfEWa2KbiorZWSTmavoO604" width="2232" height="1253"></p>
<h4>Resources Minification</h4>
<p>This one sits on top of basic concept: The smaller the data you ship from the server to the client, the faster the page load gets. Minification consists of reducing size of stylesheets and scripts by removing spaces, line breaks and performing some additional processing to put the file as small as possible. Nowadays, you don’t need to minify your assets outside of your project, you can integrate a minifier directly in your build process. Ask WebPack and Maven about it. These are just examples, of course. The caveat of minification is code readability when debugging the web application in production, it will drive you crazy.</p>
<h4>Load assets from CDN</h4>
<p>CDN stands for: Content download network. What is to load an asset from a CDN? Why load assets from CDN? Where else would the assets be loaded from? A CDN is responsible for caching web content and serve it from the server that is closer to the user requesting the content. CDNs are prepared to handle a high load of requests, meaning, you can rely on them. You may load libraries like jquery, angular and others from a CDN and be sure that it will get loaded as fast as possible. On the other hand, you don’t have to download the libraries into your web applications directory structure. You are simply pointing to a web content using a URL. Take Facebook as an example: they use their own CDN to load photos (<a href="https://fbcdn.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fbcdn.net</a> ) you can check it yourself by inspecting the facebook web app.</p>
<p>The caveat of this method is: potential incompatibility with production environment policies. Sometimes you a web app that is being server in a VPN with very strict firewall rules and users aren’t allowed to fetch content from external servers (Internet).</p>
<h4>Stylesheets and script Concatenation (webpack)</h4>
<p>You might be tempted to believe this is the same with Minification but it’s not. Concatenation is the act of joining multiple files into one. What are the advantages of this? When you have multiple resources to load, you have multiple requests to be fired and you will have the DNS lookup overhead for each of the requests and then you also have the connection establishment overhead (although keep-alive can minimize this one) and the number of resources to be simultaneously loaded from the same domain is limited and varies from browser to browser. Instead of having the browser trying to fetch for example jquery and bootstrap in separated request, why not concatenate them into one single file (during the build process would be the right moment). Webpack is very good to setup a concatenation pipeline, and it’s simple to use (right now I sound like some Webpack activist). The caveat of the concatenation is the possibility of loading content that the current user won’t even be accessing: JavaScript based applications are the most vulnerable to this, but fortunately it’s an issue that developers can easily get around. Concatenate the right assets and you will get performance improvement, concatenate the wrong ones and you will damage the user experience.</p>
<h4>Multiple domain names for faster assets loading</h4>
<p>Each Browser defines a maximum number of requests to be done concurrently to the same domain name.</p>
<p>This limit affects your web application performance obviously and if you are sure that you will need to concurrently load more content than most of the browsers allow you, then, it’s time for you to create multiple sub-domains for you web application and use each of the sub-domains to load a specific set or type of content. For example, in Youtube, the images that we see as video thumbnails, are being fetched from a different domain which is <a href="https://ytimg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ytimg.com</a>. You can see it by yourself, by simply inspecting the youtube website. Facebook also uses the same technique (photos CDN, remember?), LinkedIn and Twitter all embrace this technique because it really makes the difference. Remember that each browser imposes its own limit, and if I were you, I would work based in the lowest limit because pre-processing the content differently to each of the browsers will also bring some overhead and may even kill the optimization you will be trying to get. This technique requires you to pay some attention regarding the cookies. Make sure they point to the domain an not to a specific sub domain, unless you know what you are doing.</p>
<h4>GZIP compression</h4>
<p>This optimization is the cheaper one, because nowadays, most of the web servers offer some config way to get the GZIP compression in place. But wait? What is GZIP Compression? It’s a data compression algorithm. Would it require you to include some lib into your web application? No. The content compression should be handled in the infrastructure level because it’s directly related to the communication protocol, which is HTTP. The thing about data compression on the web, is that the server …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>SolidRun has a new development in their NXP Layerscape LX2160A based systems this week. The new SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server packages two of their familiar HoneyComb LX2K boards into a single chassis. This includes a power supply and accommodations for 2.5″ or 3.5″ SATA storage. While the board at the core of this system is not a new part this does mark a milestone for deploy-ability of Arm systems at a tier that does not have a lot of other attention.<span id="more-51095"></span></p>
<h2>SolidRun HoneyComb LX2 Server Background</h2>
<p>To take a step back and look at where this system lands, the Arm ecosystem currently has a lot of activity at the top and bottom of the price and performance spectrum, with not a lot of options in the middle. That is where SolidRun’s new dual-node server aims to compete.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi systems between $5 and $100 have shipped over 30 million units. Developer kits such as these have earned a level of ubiquity in learning and DIY spaces for making it really easy to try out new concepts in programming or “physical computing.” While the Raspberry Pi Foundation has demonstrated using the Raspberry Pi 4 in production, including running Raspberry Pi 4s to serve their website for the launch of the Pi 4, that is not quite what they are designed for. In that example, the Foundation included their own hardware between more performant load balancers and database machines as a demonstration of their very capable new devices, not quite as a shot across the bow to the Xeons they may have replaced.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, several orders of magnitude away, Ampere Altra is making a case for permanently replacing some of those Xeons for certain customers. Ampere’s price-to-performance numbers are impressive, as are figures like 160 cores for a 2 socket server and 128 lanes of PCIe Gen4 per socket. This underscores that this is a platform designed for cloud providers and hyperscalers.

<p>There is enough intrigue over the top-of-line Arm servers that developers wonder if there is not a better workstation-level/ or entry/mid-range server system. A prospective Arm developer would want something between $100 for a dev board and $4000 per socket for a screaming 2U. (Apologies to the $800 32-core 1.7GHz SKU at the other end of the Ampere Altra line.)</p>
<p>SolidRun has been positioning itself in this space for several years. Its LX2 products continue in active development. HoneyComb’s maturity dovetails with the work SolidRun has been doing on two fronts. It is servicing its niche and driving specific development (for example their high bandwidth networking) but return their development work to benefit the ease of adoption from mainline Linux.</p>

<p>The HoneyComb LX2K is a COM Express Type 7 carrier for an NXP Layerscape LX2160A System-on-Chip with 16x Arm A72 cores running up to 2GHz. The COM Express Type 7 module has dual-channel DDR4 in SODIMMs for up to 64GB total. The carrier board exposes 4x SATA, one M.2 and one Micro SD slot for storage, four SFP+ (directly from the SoC) and one RJ45 at 1Gb for networking, dual USB 3.0 ports, and an open-ended PCIe x8 slot on a standard mini ITX form factor using standard ATX power. There is even the ATX standard power indicator and reset button header. The goal seems to be to create a platform that is easy to integrate into existing chassis and systems.</p>

<p>In the context of running highly deployable servers to replace Xeons, this may not be quite the same level of hardware maturity. On the other hand, having a dual-node 1U platform that one can deploy in racks and do Arm development is a big step forward. Not only do we get a bigger CPU, but we also get the ability to use a lot of standard components which will help boost the ecosystem as well. Adding a chassis with cooling and power may not seem like a big deal, but there is a large segment of the market that does not want to search for or cobble together these solutions. Instead, if the nodes are already in a 1U chassis, that lowers the friction and barriers to entry for development. This is still not a $400-500 PC or Atom server. Still, it is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>SolidRun’s HoneyComb LX2K is a platform that is accessible and capable for development on 64-bit Arm architecture as a workstation. It is also becoming more deployment-ready for appliance-type power-conscious edge applications with the 1U chassis. Developers interested in using the HoneyComb board in production have faced the challenge of trying to rack-mount an ITX board. Bamboo Systems in the UK have an answer for developers ready to deploy an 8-node 1U, but that raises the bar back up the scale of Ampere Altra. The challenge with small server nodes is that as one scales, it tends to be more efficient having larger nodes. AWS Gravition2 is an important product for the industry, but it is also tied to the AWS ecosystem. The new availability to deploy two nodes in 1U targets the intersection of accessibility and capability for those interested to kick the tires on Arm in the wild.</p>
<p>We look forward to getting our hands on the dual sled system and doing an in-depth review. We will also pair that with approaching the HoneyComb Board as a workstation for daily-driver use. Leave a comment if you would like to see specific applications explored for either system.</p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The following article is a technical deep dive into how genetic algorithms can be leveraged to create superhuman XSS
polyglot payloads. </p>
<p>We start by highlighting the importance of detecting XSS vulnerabilities, the challenges
faced by automated solutions to fully test real-life applications in a reasonable time, and then we goe into a
technical deep dive on the use of genetic algorithms to create polyglot payloads. </p>
<p>The final part of the article shows examples of the generated payloads and discusses areas for future improvements.</p>
<h2>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h2>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability class that affects Web Applications. It concerns also Mobile Applications built
using javascript multi-platform Frameworks, like Cordova or Ionic and browser embedded applications.</p>
<p><img alt="H1" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/polyglot_xss/image2.png" title="Hacker One Stats"></p>
<p>According to Hacker One’s "Trends and Security report", XSS is the most reported vulnerability. It has also been
listed in the OWASP Top 10 Security Risk since its start in 2003.</p>
<p><img alt="OWSP" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/polyglot_xss/image6.png" title="OWASP Top 10"></p>
<p>Besides the widespread of XSS vulnerabilities, their impact can have severe consequences. For instance, an XSS in Cloud
Console, like AWS can lead to remote code execution in an EC2 instance. An XSS on Google Playstore can lead to malicious
application installation on the targetted user’s mobile device.</p>
<p>XSS has also been used by state-sponsored attackers and criminal organizations to track dissidents and whistleblowers’
locations or to unmask their real identities.</p>
<p>Sources: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3329296/twitter-bug-may-have-been-exploited-by-state-sponsored-hackers.html">Twitter XSS exploited by state-sponsored attackers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-deprecates-xss-auditor-for-chrome">XSS Auditor deprecation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, exploitation of XSS is hard to detect. Protection solutions like WAF or RASP are ineffective, to the
point where Chrome XSS Auditor was eventually deprecated because of the prevalence of known bypasses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/TuYw-EZhO9g/m/blGViehIAwAJ?pli=1">XSS Auditor Bypasses</a></li>
</ul>
<p>XSS are not only common, but its impact can be devastating and real-life exploitation is hard to detect.</p>
<h2>Spotting XSS</h2>
<p>XSS happens in different forms and shapes. There are reflected XSS, persistent, DOM-based, postMessage-based.</p>
<p>The input of an XSS can come from the path, the parameters, the URL fragment, the cookie, the referrer. It can be
injected from a parent frame or from a child iframe.</p>
<p>Static approaches to detect XSS vulnerabilities are rarely effective due to the highly dynamic nature of the Javascript
language. This fact is exacerbated by Javascript transpiler, minifier, and uglifier that leverage the dynamic nature of
the language for performance and obfuscation reasons.</p>
<p><img alt="JS" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/polyglot_xss/image1.png" title="Minified JS"></p>
<p>The most effective way to identify XSS vulnerabilities is using dynamic analysis, which can be further enhanced by different
forms of execution tracing, like trusted-types taint tracing, function hooking, or low-level chrome String tracing.</p>
<p>Detecting XSS with dynamic analysis is simple. It consists of injecting a working payload that would trigger a
callback indicating the success of the injection.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Detection</h2>
<p>Ostorlab’s implementation relies on Chrome to render and test the XSS. Using a full-blown browser allows out-of-the-box
support of the javascript heavy application, like SPA built using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.</p>
<p>Chrome is started in headless mode with a long list of flags for performance optimization, like disabling certain
human-friendly features, as well as disabling certain security features that could affect the result of the analysis.</p>
<p>Below an example of some of the flags passed to chrome:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>'--no-default-browser-check'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--no-first-run'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-client-side-phishing-detection'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-default-apps'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-extensions'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--mute-audio'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-background-timer-throttling'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-features=ScriptStreaming'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-hang-monitor'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-ipc-flooding-protection'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-notifications'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-popup-blocking'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-prompt-on-repost'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-renderer-backgrounding'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--js-flags=--random-seed=XXXXX,</span>
<span>'--use-gl=swiftshader'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-background-networking'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-breakpad'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-component-update'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-domain-reliability'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--disable-sync'</span><span>,</span>
<span>'--metrics-recording-only'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once chrome is running, many test sessions start simultaneously injecting each target input with a payload.</p>
<p>A payload takes a form similar to <code>&lt;svg onload={callback}&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The callback can have multiple implementations, it can be a Javascript function that can send a request to the server, 
it can be an alert box or console message.</p>
<p>Ostorlab implementation relies on console events to notify of the presence of an XSS. Other approaches have shown
quirks when overloading the callback with any javascript logic, which can lead the code to be hoisted, added to the
bottom of the javascript queue.</p>
<p>The queue is generally overloaded with events caused by the XSS fuzzer and can cause the XSS to be missed if the page
is exited before fully clearing the queue.</p>
<p>Console messages are sent directly by Chrome and can be intercepted using the Chrome Debug protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Console/">Chrome Debug Protocol: Console</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The console has however been deprecated in favor of a more powerful replacement, that provides a long-awaited
functionality, stack tracing: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Log/">Chrome Debug Protocol: Log</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Million Payload Dilemma</h2>
<p>The Achilles heel of XSS dynamic testing the million payload dilemma.</p>
<p>XSS also happens in different contexts on the client-side, it can happen in an <code>a</code> tag, a <code>div</code> tag, in an attribute,
in its content. It can have a size limitation, a character limitation, or it can be caused by injecting a specialized JSON
object and can come from different input sources.
Example of contexts:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>@app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>"/test_bed/html_element"</span><span>)</span>

<p>Let’s do some basic math to understand the scope of the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we would like to test 30 injection contexts (Ostorlab’s testbed has over 50 injection contexts and we
keep adding new ones) and we would on average test for 20 injection points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path <code>/{here}/{here2}/{here3}</code></li>
<li>URL Argument <code>/a/b/c?q={here}&amp;{here}=test</code></li>
<li>Fragment <code>a/b/c#{here}</code></li>
<li>Cookies <code>Cookile: {here}={here}</code></li>
<li>Headers <code>{here}: {here}\r\n</code></li>
<li>Body parameters <code>{here}={here}&amp;{here}={here}</code></li>
<li>Referer <code>Referer: {here}</code></li>
<li>Iframe parent injection</li>
</ul>
<p>And we would like to test every page, a web application like Uber, unauthenticated parts only has over 120k page, the
institutional web site of a bank like ING has over 7k pages.</p>
<p>The test with high performances parallel VM would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 payloads</li>
<li>20 injection points</li>
<li>20 seconds per test between loading, execution, click event triggering, and callback execution</li>
<li>100 parallel instances</li>
</ul>
<p>Uber test would take 72M payload and 166 days to complete, ING would require 4.2 M requests would take 9 days to
complete.</p>
<p><img alt="req" src="https://blog.ostorlab.co/static/img/polyglot_xss/image4.jpg" title="Request"></p>
<p>Testing every page, in every input, for every vulnerability, covering every context, needs millions of requests, which
requires days, if not weeks to complete.</p>
<h2>Polyglot Payloads</h2>
<p>In order to lower the number of requests needed to fully test an application, combining multiple injection contexts
with a single payload is a very beneficial optimization.</p>
<p>For instance, replacing 30 contexts with a single payload will allow us to go from 166 days of testing to 5 days for
Uber and from 9 days of testing to 7 hours.</p>

<p>Discussions of abstraction in programming often feel pointless. I've started to think that the participants have different models of abstraction. However, it's been hard for me to say distinguish them clearly. Some ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Abstraction as deduplication</em>: everywhere</li>
<li><em>Abstraction as indirection</em>: enterprise Java</li>
<li><em>Abstraction as generality</em>: Haskell typeclasses</li>
</ul>
<p>There is substantial overlap, but each model of abstraction has different talking points, for and against:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't repeat yourself</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">duplication is better than the wrong abstraction</a></li>
<li>avoid coupling</li>
<li>it should easy to find out what the code does</li>
<li>keep code concrete</li>
<li>laws<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Does one of these models have a claim to be <em>the</em> definition of abstraction? What other models are there? What, if anything, makes it fruitful to discuss "abstraction", without specifying a model?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't remember when I heard that, but it stuck. When a quip "clicks" for me, I can't rest until I find a framing in which it's disproved. But it's been 6 years now, and I'm still unable to muster a reply to the above other than "Yeah, yeah, it seems so".</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure cache invalidation is the harder of the two, because of some underlying OCD most of us have about picking two arbitrary constants that dictate sweep frequency and TTL. I'd even go as far as to speculate most of the evolution of programming has been a weird spiritual exercise around trying not to pick those two arbitrary numbers. Functional programming as a whole can even be understood as a set of taboos around this, because what good is shared OCD if it doesn't lead to religion.</p>
<p>I digress, I'm neither old, wise nor crazy enough to talk about cache invalidation, so I'll talk about the second hardest thing in programming instead, naming things.</p>
<h2>i - Naming necessity</h2>
<p>Maybe I'm being vague here, but please bear with me, I am trying to introduce the practice that leads to the creation of civilization and distinguishes us from apes</p>
<p>Naming helps one make sense of code.</p>
<p>That's not quite right... naming <em>gives</em> sense to code.</p>
<p>In theory, names could be arbitrary, at the ASM level it's more than reasonable to replace names with addresses. Yet names are so useful, that they persist even when code is compiled, presumably because they help preserve sanity when one is forced to look at the generate ASM.</p>
<p>In so far as names help make sense of code, they operate at different levels.</p>
<p>Names help connect the developer with the end goal of the software. I think the main reason OO became popular as a paradigm for teaching was a culture of example programs that used names referencing the "real world". Using words like "Shop" and "Transaction" and "buy" and "transfer_to", that give the student's bored brain some bit of reality to hang on to.</p>
<p>Names help in building a mental map of software. In this regard, names function much like <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">any other arbitrary category we instil upon the world</a>, be it those that we use to refer to animals, other people, the night's sky or, to make the similarity to code more obvious, the content of one's bowel movement. In this sense, names should optimize for a map of the code that makes sense to the one writing it, you.</p>
<p>I'm just kidding though, the "you" here is really "a team" and the "a team" here is really "a team with people coming and going, people which have imperfect memory and ever-changing minds with which they read that map".</p>
<p>We can already see some tradeoffs here. Names that will help you now are not necessarily ones that will help the team 5 years from now. Maybe <code>let IHateThisFingLoop</code> is a useful outlet for one's anger or <code>val steves_moms = FAT32()</code> provided some much needed comedic relief. But naming for the moment can often backfire. Not only when naming for catharsis. We have such a good map of the code we're working on <strong>now</strong> that an "obvious" name can be a horrible choice in hindsight. Depending on our mental context, the name <code>trx</code> might be a much-welcomed shorthand for <code>write_new_credentials_transaction</code>, or it might be the cause of a security error that makes the news.</p>
<p>Names aren't there just to express the concepts we already have, once a name is chosen, if encountered often enough, it becomes its own concept. One need only looks at the old sciences to see arbitrary variable names that are now rooted in people's mindsdb as describing the fundamental nature of reality in an irreducible way. <code>pi</code> and <code>e</code> as representations of the circle, <code>x</code> as describing the concept of unkown, <code>c</code> as describing the maximum speed an object can travel with if Maxwell's equations are to hold... etc).</p>
<p>If a perfectly-named codebase were to exist, it would provide the reader with an amazing understanding of the things it's used for, in addition to being easy to grok. The sad thing is that "perfectly-named" is something that varies between people and even within people (over time).</p>
<p>I also think that the "experience" people have with names might vary greatly based on the codebases they worked on. Working in a large codebase with loads of existing names and naming standards provides a completely different naming-experience from building something from scratch.</p>
<p>Indeed, understanding a codebase or even a language can probably be boiled down to being familiar with all of its names and naming convention.</p>
<p>There might be a type of person that can remember all the names of the functions in a stdlib and yet know nothing about a language. But, in spite of our education system trying to optimize for the psychiatric illness which would allow this, for the vast majority of people understanding a language still boils down to knowing the vocabulary.</p>
<h2>ii - Naming convention</h2>
<p>The foreplay to naming things is coming up with conventions about naming things. A convention dictates the boundaries of what names one can give in various situations. For example, the conventions I usually impose are:</p>
<ul>
<li>class and struct names should be CammelCase</li>
<li>function and variable names should be snake_case</li>
<li>constants (in the constexpr sense), enum members and global aliases should be ALL_CAPS_SANKE_CASE</li>
<li>function only used inside the file they are in have names starting with <code>_</code></li>
<li>names should be &gt;1 and &lt;20 letters, &gt;0 and &lt;5 words, exceptions are allowed</li>
<li>If the type of a variable is not obvious from usage, have a name that implies the type (e.g. <code>customer_arr</code>, <code>equation_dict</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of it is written down in our coding guidelines, people just sort of "catch onto it", even first-time contributors, I find this fascinating.</p>
<p>There are many things new people seem to miss that I have to re-iterate time and time again, but naming is never one of them. Nor was it ever a problem for me when joining a new team to pick up on their conventions.</p>
<p>Though maybe this ease of adoption would disappear if the conventions were too niche or too many?</p>
<p>Conventions are useful for two major reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They reduce the thought space when searching for a good name.</li>
<li>They add meaning to existing names without making them longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to understand naming go digging for conventions, but due to the above issue (people catch onto them instinctively), good conventions are hard to find. Some conventions were so good they got codified into language syntax.</p>
<p>Did you know <code>const</code> (i.e. immutability) wasn't a thing in any popular programming language until the early 80s when C++ came along? People (presumably) used to write it as part of variable names and hope that it would be respected by convention.</p>
<p>The idea of objects and classes are essentially a mix of naming and file-placement conventions that got mixed, at least in imperative land.</p>
<p>Even more so, one suspects that "types" were originally a mere naming convention, though the asteroid destroyed most of the evidence that could be used to conclude that with certainty. But nowadays "types" seem to be used as part of names in language lacking a type system.</p>
<h2>iii - Naming history</h2>
<p>But, asks the reader of 2050, I heard that back in your days there as a field called "mathematics", a thing humans did before computers, where they tried (and often failed miserably) to <a href="https://blog.cerebralab.com/Neural_networks_as_non-leaky_mathematical_abstraction">use their brains to execute formal logic</a>.</p>
<p>You are quite perceptive in remaking that, and I agree we can't understand naming in programming while ignoring 3000 years of naming in mathematics. The most basic names in programming, those shared between most languages, those of the operators (+,-,*,/,^,&amp; ...etc) are pulled out or inspired from math.</p>
<p>In my arbitrarily chosen view of the world, mathematics was an imperfect tool with imperfect creators built in a time before modern brains and modern machines, thus it's riddled with <a href="https://cerebralab.com/Named_Distributions_as_Artifacts">flaws and limitations</a>. One of the most obvious flaws in the way things were named.</p>
<p>When using "math notation" people tended to prefer very short names, namely 1 symbol long. A programmer might write something akin to:</p>
<pre><code>function calc_quarterly_interest(principal, rate, quarters):
    return principal*rate*time
</code></pre>
<p>Though the most obsessive might go all the way to writing:</p>
<pre><code>function calculate_quarterly_interest(principal, rate, quarters):
    quarterly_returns = multiply(principal, rate)
    return multiply(quarterly_returns, time)
</code></pre>
<p>However, in math notation, it would be considered bad form to write anything longer or more expressive than</p>
<pre><code>i(p,r,q)=p*r*q

</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this, I presume, boils down to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving paper, which could often be quite expensive and impossible to erase.</li>
<li>Reducing the amount of writing in materials like sand or clay, which are cheap and easy to erase, but difficult to write in.</li>
</ol>
<p>This didn't cause many issues because our brains are not very good at executing formal logic. So a given mathematical construct might have included 2, 3, 5 maybe 10 entities playing around. But to postulate an equation with thousands of variable probably seemed like madness even to a genius like Euler or grand curator like Euclid.</p>
<p>Of course, we live in an age where a mildly talented 8-year-old can pick up a toy language like Scratch and construct such an equation incidentally while writing a web app. Nowadays we need only write the equations, historically our brains were also responsible for executing them. This restricted the realm of possibilities to one so tiny I shudders to think about the lamentable condition of the poor souls that helped us get to where we could build computers.</p>
<p>Still, the reason why the previously mentioned interest computing function would work is that the writer could simply specify beforehand: "p stands for principal, r for rate, q for number of quarters".</p>
<p>This is a practice that remained with us until the 80s in a weird way, the name of variables used to be declared at the beginning of a file before they were initialized. Though it may seem crazy to you, C and C++ allow you to compile the following code:</p>
<pre><code>int a;</code></pre></div></div>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator">Parser combinators</a> are
sets of functions for building parsers in a composable fashion. Haskell’s
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec">Parsec library</a> and OCaml’s
<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a> are two examples.
Both of these libraries expose <em>monadic</em> interfaces for
describing context-sensitive grammars. This post looks at implementing a more
restricted parsing library, structured around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor">applicative
functors</a> rather
than monads.</p>

<p>What could justify giving up on monads? Depending on the design, one may get
a few things in return. In this exercise, the aim is for an API with the following
features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ability to extract all valid symbols from a parser.</li>
  <li>Allow some form of pretty printing.</li>
  <li>Support multiple evaluation strategies (e.g. backtracking and non-backtracking).</li>
</ol>

<p>To see why (1) is not possible to accomplish with monads, consider a parser
constructed using the monadic <em>bind-operator</em>:</p>



<p>Here, <code>f</code> is a function of the form <code>'a -&gt; 'b parser</code>; that means we don’t
know what sort of parser it produces until it’s provided with a value. Therefore,
we cannot infer all possible symbols consumed by those parsers. The same
reasoning applies to pretty printing.</p>

<h3 id="designing-a-parser-type">Designing a parser type</h3>

<p>The essence of a parser is a function with a type analogous to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span> <span>option</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A parser takes a list of characters as input, and, when successful, returns a
parsed value along with the remaining input.</p>

<p>This representation, however, falls short of supporting symbol
extraction, pretty printing, or allowing for multiple evaluation strategies.
To accommodate for those we’d have to embellish the type with more context.
The problem is we don’t necessarily know the complete feature set upfront.
Every time a request for some new capability comes in – be it error reporting,
logging or something else – we would have to go back and change the definition
to accommodate for the new functionality.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to anticipate all use cases upfront, an alternative
approach is to choose a representation that preserves as much structure as
possible, so that alternative interpreters may be added later on. To do that,
we’re effectively going to enumerate the set of parsers, and ways of
combining them, by defining a type for representing an abstract syntax tree
(AST). To this purpose, we’ll use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>, that
also expresses that different parsers are indexed by different types. The
initial constructors are split into two sets – primitive ones (the
leaf nodes of the tree), and combinators for composing parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>(* Primitive parsers *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fail</span>      <span>:</span> <span>string</span>            <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Empty</span>     <span>:</span>                       <span>unit</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Return</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>                <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Symbol</span>    <span>:</span> <span>char</span>              <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - applicative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Map</span>       <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Product</span>   <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span>
  <span>(* Composition - alternative *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Either</span>    <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The primitive parsers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Fail msg</code> - a parser that always fails.</li>
  <li><code>Empty</code> - a parser that succeeds when given empty input.</li>
  <li><code>Return x</code> - a parser that does not consume any input and always returns <code>x</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Symbol c</code> - a parser that matches input when the first character is <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicative interface is what provides sequential composition, as in:
first parse <code>x</code> with parser <code>p1</code>, then parse <code>y</code> with parser <code>p2</code> and combine
their results.</p>

<p>The <code>Either</code> constructor makes it possible to provide alternative execution
paths, i.e. parsers that succeed on different types of input.</p>

<p>As we don’t want to give users direct access to the type, we’ll mechanically
add some smart constructors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fail</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fail</span> <span>m</span>

<span>let</span> <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Return</span> <span>x</span>

<span>let</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>c</span>

<span>let</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Product</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>Either</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>q</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having an applicative interface means that it is also possible to leverage
the new syntax extension – the <code>let+ .. and+</code> notation – which I’ve described
<a href="http://jobjo.github.io//2019/04/24/ocaml-has-some-new-shiny-syntax.html">here</a>.
Assuming OCaml 4.08 or the dune
<a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/let-syntax-backported-to-ocaml-4-02/3447">future_syntax stanza</a>
, we can add a syntax module, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>and</span><span>+</span><span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>product</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to these, we’ll include an <code>Ops</code> module with infix versions
and some derived combinators:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Ops</span> <span>=</span> <span>struct</span>
  <span>open</span> <span>Syntax</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>   <span>=</span> <span>map</span> <span>f</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;|&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>pf</span> <span>px</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>pf</span> <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>px</span> <span>in</span> <span>f</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>*&gt;</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>(</span> <span>&lt;*</span>  <span>)</span> <span>p</span> <span>q</span>   <span>=</span> <span>const</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>q</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before moving on, some of the code examples also assume a few general
utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Identity *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>id</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Const *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>const</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span>

<span>(* Forward composition *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>(</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>b</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>c</span>

<span>(* Converting a char list to a string *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>:</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span>

<span>(* And back again *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>list_of_string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>char</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Their implementation, along with the complete code is available
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jobjo/13376aaea1151100dd7915dedb35d9d7">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="building-simple-parsers">Building simple parsers</h3>

<p>How can we use the API to build actual parsers? Let’s consider a few simple
examples. First, a parser that parses a specific string, i.e. a function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>string</span> <span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To implement the <code>string</code> parser, we can use the <code>symbol</code> primitive and fold over the
given string to combine the parsers using applicative (<code>let+ .. and+)</code> syntax:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>string</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>accum</span> <span>c</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>(* Parse 'x' using the 'symbol c' parser *)</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>c</span>
    <span>(* Then parse 'xs' using the 'p' parser *)</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>(* Combine 'x' and 'xs' in a string *)</span>
    <span>Printf</span><span>.</span><span>sprintf</span> <span>"%c%s"</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_right</span> <span>accum</span> <span>(</span><span>list_of_string</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s attempt a parser for parsing digits. A version that
detects a single digit may be defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>list_of_string</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Choosing between a list of parsers is a natural generalization of the binary <code>either</code>
combinator, and deserves its own version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>choose</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>fold_left</span> <span>either</span> <span>fail</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We may also generalize the <code>digit</code> definition to take a list of symbols as an argument:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>cs</span> <span>=</span> <span>choose</span> <span>@@</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>symbol</span> <span>cs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <code>digit</code> is achieved by:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span> <span>one_of</span> <span>"0123456789"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="hitting-the-boundaries">Hitting the boundaries</h3>

<p>Next, consider a parser that recognizes arbitrary integers? An integer
consists of at least one digit but we don’t know exactly how many. How can we
define a parser that captures this semantics? As a first try:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>digits</span> <span>()</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>map</span> <span>(</span><span>string_of_list</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>int_of_string</span><span>)</span> <span>@@</span> <span>digits</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can you spot the problem with the above definition? If not, just try running
it and you’ll find it throwing a <em>stack-overflow</em> exception. The problem is
that the recursive call is never conditional on any base case and is always
eagerly evaluated. We need a way to describe parsers that may consume
arbitrarily large inputs without constructing infinite parsing expressions!
To generalize from the <code>int</code> example, we’re aiming for a combinator with the
following signature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>many</span> <span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One solution would be to introduce a constructor, say <code>Delay</code>,
for representing lazy parsers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>delay</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Delay</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a parser with delayed construction. We may use <code>delay</code> to define
<code>many</code>, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
    <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>delay</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, each step of the recursion is evaluated on demand rather than upfront.
This solution would work well if it weren’t for the more ambitious set of constraints
having to do with pretty printing and symbol extraction. The problem is that
in order to extract all possible symbols of a delayed parser, we’d need to evaluate
it; this would unroll the infinite recursion expressed in the <code>many</code> definition, and
once again kill the stack.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-the-parser-definition"><em>Fixing</em> the parser definition</h3>

<p>Is there any fix for the problem of simultaneously having a finite
traversable representation, and providing sufficient expressive power for
describing infinite parsers? The clue is in the question. A way of expressing
recursive structures without recursion is exactly what is offered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">fixed-point
combinator</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s extend the parser type with a fixed-point constructor (and also get rid of <code>Delay</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>a</span> <span>t</span>

<span>let</span> <span>fix</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fix</span> <span>f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then use <code>fix</code> as a remedy for the recursiveness of the definition of <code>many</code>,
from above:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span>  <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
      <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>in</span>
      <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
    <span>in</span>
    <span>either</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that there is <em>no</em> <code>rec</code> keyword in sight. The function <code>fix</code> is just a
handy tool for allowing us to mimic recursive functions. You may be left
wondering how exactly this solves the problem of symbol extraction, given
that we still end up with <code>Fix</code> nodes – functions of type <code>('a t -&gt; 'a t)</code>
– that need to be evaluated. Hopefully, the next sections on interpreting
parsers will bring some clarity on that matter.</p>

<p>Coming back to the example of integer-parsing, here’s how <code>int</code> may be defined
in terms of <code>many</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>d</span>  <span>=</span> <span>digit</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>ds</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>digit</span> <span>in</span>
  <span>int_of_string</span> <span>@@</span> <span>string_of_list</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>::</span> <span>ds</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, we may extract the common pattern of parsing one or more times using the same
parser (one or more digits in the example above) by adding a new combinator, as in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>and</span><span>+</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a parser <code>p</code>, the parser <code>many p</code> succeeds if it can apply <code>p</code> <em>at least</em> one
time on its input.</p>

<p>As a side note, the code generously makes use of the new applicative syntax to
demonstrate how it may be used to write declarative code that also avoids
infix operators. As an alternative, we can define the same functions
without relying on the syntax extension; for instance:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(* Requires Ops module to be open *)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>fix</span> <span>@@</span> <span>fun</span> <span>many</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>either</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>

<span>let</span> <span>many_one</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>List</span><span>.</span><span>cons</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>p</span> <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> <span>many</span>…</code></pre></div></div></section></div>

      <p>Someone was silly enough to upload a
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6461d0988c835e91eb534757a9fa3ab35afe010bec7d5406d4dfb30ea767a62c">working spectre (CVE-2017-5753) exploit</a>
for Linux (there is also a
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ecc0f2aa29b102bf8d67b7d7173e8698c0341ddfdf9757be17595460fbf1791a">Windows one</a> with symbols that I didn't look at.)
on VirusTotal last month, so here is my quick Sunday afternoon lazy analysis.</p>
<p>The binary has its <code>-h</code> option stripped, likely behind a <code>#define</code> to avoid
detection, but some of its parameters are obvious, like specifying
what file to leak, or the kernel base address. The authors didn't check (or care)
that the logging function hasn't been entirely optimized out, leaving a bunch
of strings helping in the reversing process.</p>
<p>The exploit works in four stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the <a href="https://www.halolinux.us/kernel-reference/inode-objects.html">superblock</a>,</li>
<li>Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">inode</a> of the file to dump</li>
<li>Find the corresponding page address</li>
<li>Dumps the content of the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of <code>/etc/shadow</code>, the default option, the content of the
file is shoved in memory by running the following command in the
background: <code>return system("echo \"whatever\n\" | su - 2&gt; /dev/null")</code>.
In my lab, on a vulnerable Fedora, the exploit is successfully dumping <code>/etc/shadow</code> in a couple of minutes.
Interestingly, there are checks to detect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention">SMAP</a>
and abort if it's present. I didn't manage to understand why the exploit was
failing in its presence.</p>
<p>edit: Andrew Cooper from citrix was kind enough to reach out and solve the riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The covert channel is
(presumably FLUSH+RELOAD) a userspace pointer, which is accessed
speculatively in kernel context, causing a cacheline fill, and recovered
later by.
SMAP prevents supervisor code from accessing user memory operands
outside of explicitly permitted areas.  This is enough to prevent the
cacheline fill (of a userspace pointer) and break the covert channel.
A more sophisticated attack could use EVICT+RELOAD on a supervisor
pointer (or one of a multitude of other covert channels) to transmit the
same data, which is a higher barrier, but definitely not impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crux of the exploit is at <code>0x4092f0</code>, using <code>cpuid</code> as a serializing
instruction, <code>rdtsc</code> for timing, and <code>mfence</code>/<code>lfence</code> as barrier, as
documented in the paper. It's also using some tricks to minimize the amount of
readings, like type-specific functions, for example a kernel address has a
specific <em>format</em>.
Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/spendergrsec">spender</a> for confirming that the gadget used is likely <code>get_user()</code> in the <code>FIOASYNC ioctl</code>,
which was <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/kernel-hardening/patch/20180209133935.811950747@linuxfoundation.org/">fixed in 2018</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASLR">KASLR</a> is bypassed when present either by
looking at <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> when available to unprivileged users like it used
to be the case on Fedora until ~recently, or by using the generic
bypass from the <a href="https://gruss.cc/files/prefetch.pdf">prefetch side-channel</a> by Gruss and al.
originating from a library called <code>libkaslr</code>. Amusingly, this method is still
working on an up to date Linux, proving again that <a href="https://grsecurity.net/kaslr_an_exercise_in_cargo_cult_security">KASLR is useless at
best</a>.
For systems that don't have the <code>/proc/kallsym</code> file accessible, the exploit
relies on hardcoded offsets, and while only Fedora, ArchLinux and Ubuntu are currently
supported, there are functions to check for Debian and CentOS. It's a bit
surprising to see hardcoded offsets in an exploit with arbitrary read in
2021.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it had a

    <p>If you’re reading this, I’m pretty sure you’ve seen the following pattern over and over again:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creative nonfiction pioneer John McPhee distilled decades of experience and first-hand learnings in a series of essays. (The best of them are now available in a book called “Draft No. 4”.)</li>
  <li>A savvy entrepreneur repackages the advice in a $1000+ cohort-based course.</li>
  <li>Someone takes the course and summarizes what he learned.</li>
  <li>People on Twitter start creating threads summarizing the student’s summaries.</li>
  <li>At some point, the guy who summarized the student’s summaries will get invited to a podcast to summarize his summary of the student’s summary.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I was kidding.</p>

<p>This is a picture-perfect example of what Sean Blanda calls the <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/55974/the-creative-worlds-bullshit-industrial-complex">Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex</a>. But my goal here is not to dunk on anyone. Instead I want to focus on something far more important.</p>

<p>The Bullshit Complex is just a symptom. What’s the underlying cause?</p>

<p>First, let me clarify one thing. While I’m convinced that remixed content is largely a waste of time for writers and readers, it’s a free world out there. Do whatever makes you happy. If you focus on remixed or “curated” content I’ll probably not follow you on Twitter or read your blog, but there’s no reason why you should care about that. Ultimately, it’s your own responsibility to decide how you spend your time and what kind of content you consume.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s talk about entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In recent years one of the most common pieces of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs has become that you should focus on building an audience. Everyone is screaming it from the rooftops.</p>

<p>So when I started to get into entrepreneurship a few months ago, that’s exactly what I did. I spent a lot of time researching what kind of tweets get attention and set the goal for myself to post at least two tweets per week and two blog posts per month. After all, churning out content regularly is key if you want to build an audience, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=67&amp;v=cubPiuD7_dA&amp;feature=youtu.be">right</a>?</p>

<p>If you need any evidence how serious I was about the whole building an audience thing, here it is: I created a <a href="https://whattotweet.com/">What to Tweet</a> tool because I was struggling to stick to my Twitter schedule.</p>

<p>Looking back at it now I think I largely wasted my time. And more importantly I see so many people falling into the exact same trap.</p>

<p>Their goal is to become entrepreneurs. But instead of building products, they create content. Or even worse, they do research and take courses on how to create content.</p>

<p>But this doesn’t bring them one inch closer to their goal. It’s just a form of procrastination.</p>

<p>While charging money for something you created is <a href="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/free">scary</a>, there is almost zero risk in putting out free content. And if you’re just remixing other people’s content, the intellectual risk is effectively zero. After all, you can always reply “hey, don’t shoot the messenger”.</p>

<p>This trap is particularly dangerous because it feels like you’re making progress while really you don’t.</p>

<p>Aspiring entrepreneurs are not just wasting a lot of time but also lots of money this way. They spend thousands of dollars on courses that teach them how to remix other people’s content more effectively. They buy the latest hyped-up courses that teach them how to craft more effective tweets, blog posts and Youtube videos.</p>

<p>But don’t get me wrong. <em>Having</em> an audience is awesome and I love great content.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that too many beginners have their priorities backwards and fall into the “build an audience!” trap.</p>

<p>An exemplary plan looks as follows: “I don’t know what product I should create. So I’m planning to create articles or carousels on Linkedin to find my voice and build an audience.” That’s almost verbatim a paragraph from an email I received two days ago.</p>

<p>You can certainly get a lot of followers by churning out remixed content and feel-good platitudes. But everyone seems to forget that not all audiences are alike.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have 2000 followers that you got by posting feel-good platitudes, whereas I only have two followers called Elon Musk and Paul Graham. Would you swap accounts?</p>

<p>With feel-good platitudes and remixed content you’ll only attract fellow beginners. Everyone else recognizes the content immediately for what it is. Hence, the primary value of your much larger audience is that you’re able to sell them a “How to grow your Twitter following” Gumroad course for $47.</p>

<p>A high-quality audience is an endless source of opportunities. A low quality one is at most a Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>Many people <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1364334719970721793">learn</a> this the hard way. They get lured by the promise that they’ll be able to create content effortlessly and build an audience this way. This is exactly what beginners want to hear and hence what gurus are preaching. “Everything is a remix”. So just progressively summarize a bunch of books and then start sharing pieces you remixed from your summaries.</p>

<p>Students of these courses spent months recording videos and writing thousands of words only to discover that they never said anything meaningful.</p>

<p>Valuable content that truly advances the conversation and gets the attention of people you really want to connect with is never effortless. It’s painful. And I’m not talking about some kind of sophisticated editing process, but the writing itself.</p>

<p>In fact, this is how you know that you’re creating valuable content. You should at least be a little scared before you hit the publish button.</p>

<p>Publishing content online is the best way to become visible so that opportunities can find you. But please don’t try to improve your ability to come up with interesting things by reading and connecting ideas just so that you have something to write about.</p>

<p>If you ever notice that you’re trying to “say something interesting”, stop. You’re just going to feed the Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>Your main priority always should be to <em>do</em> meaningful things, to solve real-world problems, to be the man in the arena. And if you share what you learn along the way, people will start to listen. Write when you have something meaningful to say, and not to stick to some self-imposed writing schedule.</p>

<p>A hidden benefit of this strategy is that your writing skills become largely irrelevant. It’s certainly true that great writers like John McPhee can make a topic as boring as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54983.Oranges">Oranges</a> exciting. But if you have a great story to tell or learned something important, people will pay attention no matter how bad your writing is. Not convinced? Just look at the essay you’re reading right now.</p>

<p>Save yourself thousands of dollars. Here’s all the writing advice you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share meaningful first-hand experiences.</li>
  <li>Write as if you were emailing a friend, not to impress an imaginary teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I’m definitely scared to publish this essay. This is exactly why I’ll do it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="fsdocs-content">
            
<p>F#+ is a base library that aims to take F# to the next level of functional
programming.</p>
<p><em>What if we imagine F# as more than it is?</em></p>
<p>F#+ builds upon FSharp, using generic programming techniques to help
you avoid boiler plate code.  However, by naming conventions and signatures
it can be seen to 'enhance' rather than 'replace' existing patterns as much
as possible.</p>
<p>The additions can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/extensions.html">Extensions</a> to core types, such as <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/reference/fsharpplus-string.html"><code>String.toLower</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/generic-doc.html">Generic Functions and Operators</a> like <code>map</code>, which can be extended to support other types</p></li>
<li>
<p>Generic and customizable <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/computation-expressions.html">Computation Expressions</a>,
like <code>monad</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>A generic <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/numerics.html">Math Module</a></p></li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/abstractions.html">Abstractions</a> that capture common FP patterns, such as
the standard monads Cont, Reader, Writer, State and their Monad Transformers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some new types that work well with the abstractions, such as NonEmptyList,
DList and Validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A polymorphic <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/tutorial.html#Lens">Lenses/Optics</a> to easily read and update
parts of immutable data</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generic methods that help you with <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/parsing.html">parsing</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that F#+ does not go into solving a specific thing for a specific
technology, such as JSON parsing.</p>
<p>Some functions are available as <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus/extension-methods.html">extension methods</a>
so are callable from C#. Note that this is not complete, or currently considered high priority.</p>
<p>Getting started is easy since you can start with enjoying some of the extensions
and generic functions, but you will find other parts of F#+ unfold before you
and become useful the deeper in you get.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working at Materialize for almost a year now, and I have really enjoyed learning about and using <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a> (hereafter just Differential) in my day-to-day work. In this post, I’ll introduce Differential and talk through implementing a few common programming problems like list intersection and everyone’s favorite, FizzBuzz, as dataflow programs. Finally, I’ll build a simple version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> (hereafter just Life) in Differential. My main goal is to describe how to write algorithms in Differential and give some intuition for when that’s a good idea. This post requires some knowledge of Rust to read the examples but otherwise assumes no prior background. All the example code lives in a <a href="https://github.com/ruchirK/life-differential">repository</a>; you’ll just need to be able to build and run Rust programs to follow along!</p>
<p>Differential is a declarative, data-parallel, dataflow, incremental framework for performing computations over changing data. This is quite a jargon-y sentence so lets dress it down a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Declarative” means that you don’t get to specify as much about <em>how</em> to implement an algorithm, vs <em>what</em> the algorithm does (and leave the <em>how</em> to the framework). In particular, you don’t get to make decisions like “should I use a hash table, binary tree or linked list here?” (a blessing and a curse). Instead, users are only allowed to think in terms of collections. Collections are generalized, multi-versioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset">multisets</a> that store information in terms of <code>(data, time, multiplicity)</code> triples which means “at some discrete <code>time</code> we added <code>multiplicity</code> copies of <code>data</code> in our bag. <code>multiplicity</code> is allowed to be negative. Differential uses collections to represent changes over time, and thus positive multiplicities denote inserts and negative multiplicities denote deletes. If you’re still confused about collections there’s a more detailed explanation in the appendix.</li>
<li>“Data-parallel” means the framework parallelizes computations by slicing and dicing data to different workers (when possible). Each worker gets a local copy of the data it needs and is then free to do its computation as if it were the only one. As the programmer you are free to write code and can be blissfully unaware of having multiple threads (most of the time). </li>
<li>“Dataflow” means that you can’t think of your program as a single thread of control, where there are a sequence of instructions and some abstract-Turing-machine equivalent processor executes them one at a time<sup id="fnref-2113-1"><a href="#fn-2113-1">1</a></sup>. Throw that model out. Instead, you have various functional operators, like <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> or <code>join</code> (among others). Each operator takes one or more collections as input, and spits out a new collection as output.  All you can do to write programs is stitch these operators together into a dataflow graph by sending the outputs of some operators into the inputs of others. The actual code for this looks a lot like code you might write with iterators, except Differential lets you write loops where you connect some outputs back to earlier inputs. The similarity with iterators is deceptive, as all the Differential code we’ll write merely sets up the dataflows and their operators. A separate scheduler then invokes operators based on which ones have inputs that are ready to be used.</li>
<li>“Incremental” means that as you send more data into your program, Differential will not recompute answers from scratch. Instead, Differential can re-use previously computed results to figure out new answers for changing inputs. In some cases, such as maintaining an average over a list of integers, this is already quite easy. In other cases, such as most graph algorithms, doing this by hand is quite hard. Differential dataflow makes this part automatic, and in my opinion, incremental computation is the most compelling reason to use Differential.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot of words! Don’t worry if it doesn’t all make sense immediately it will (hopefully) get better as we dip our toes into some code.</p>
<h2>Intersecting Lists</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a common interview problem: find the intersection (set of common elements) of two arrays of integers. This is probably one that most readers have seen before but still, let’s lay down a sketch of a fairly standard solution.</p>
<pre><code>use std::collections::HashSet;

fn intersection(first: &amp;[i32], second: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; Vec&lt;i32&gt; {
    let mut output = Vec::new();

    let first_set: HashSet&lt;_&gt; = first.iter().cloned().collect();
    let second_set: HashSet&lt;_&gt; = second.iter().cloned().collect();

    for element in first_set.iter() {
        if second_set.contains(element) {
            output.push(*element);
        }
    }

    output
}
</code></pre>
<p>There’s some minor Rust specific things here but by and large this should feel familiar to everyone who has written code in an imperative language. We take two arrays of integers as input, transform them both into sets, and then go through the integers in one set to see if they’re also in the second. If so, we add them to our output. Pretty simple. Let’s take a minute to appreciate two things: first, maintaining correct results over time while <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> changed arbitrarily would be hard, and second, we can’t reuse any of these pieces in Differential. We can’t convert arrays into hashsets because we only get collections, and we don’t have access to for loops because we don’t have access to control flow primitives.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to figure out a way to use dataflow operators. After digging around the docs for a bit, we can see that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Semijoin_(%E2%8B%89)(%E2%8B%8A)">semijoin</a> <a href="https://docs.rs/differential-dataflow/0.11.0/differential_dataflow/operators/join/trait.Join.html#tymethod.semijoin">operator</a> looks very promising. <code>semijoin</code> takes two collections, one of type <code>(Key, Value)</code> and one of type <code>(Key)</code> and produces a collection of type <code>(Key, Value)</code> that contains all <code>(k, v)</code> pairs for keys with nonzero multiplicities in both collections. That’s not exactly the intersection we want but it’s awfully close. Unfortunately, we aren’t fully out of the woods yet. It’s clear that we can use <code>i32</code> as the key in both collections, but we don’t have any values. Thankfully, this is not a problem because we can use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/tuple.html?highlight=unit#tuple-types">unit type</a> to simulate a value. We can use a <a href="https://docs.rs/differential-dataflow/0.11.0/differential_dataflow/collection/struct.Collection.html#method.map"><code>map</code></a> operator to turn a collection of type <code>T</code> into <code>(T, ())</code>. Similarly, we can use another <code>map</code> to convert back from type <code>(T, ())</code> to <code>T</code>.  At this point, the output will be almost exactly what want, except that multiplicities in the output might be greater than one but we specifically want the intersection set. We can give the collection set semantics with the <a href="https://docs.rs/differential-dataflow/0.11.0/differential_dataflow/operators/reduce/trait.Threshold.html#method.distinct"><code>distinct</code></a> operator. This implementation corresponds to the following dataflow graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect.png" alt="" width="710" height="800" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect.png 710w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect-266x300.png 266w" data-sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect.png 710w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/integer-intersect-266x300.png 266w"></p>
<p>Here, edges represent collections, and blue rectangles represent dataflow operators. I’ve labelled <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> with yellow ovals to indicate that they are input collections that get data from external inputs, rather than from another operator’s output. I’ve also annotated each collection with its type to make the intent of the <code>map</code>s more clear. The Differential version of this graph looks like the following code:</p>
<pre><code>// Assume `first` and `second` are two input collections defined elswhere.
let output = first
    .map(|x| (x, ()))
    .semijoin(&amp;second)
    .map(|(x, _)| x)
    .distinct();
</code></pre>
<p>Before we go any further, I want to call out three things. First, this is one of many possible Differential solutions. For example, we could have used <code>distinct</code> on each of the inputs before we called <code>semijoin</code>. Alternatively, we could have used the <code>join</code> operator instead of the <code>semijoin</code> operator. All of these choices have various trade-offs that are unfortunately out of scope for this post but I want to highlight that it’s not as if Differential is so strongly “declarative” that there’s only one canonical way to express a program. Second, I want to be really explicit about the relationship between the visual dataflow graph and the actual code. Every operator (blue rectangle) corresponds to one of the operator function calls in the code. Every incoming edge corresponds to one of the arguments to those functions, and every outgoing edge corresponds to one of the outputs of those functions. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we still don’t have the ability to send inputs to our dataflow operators and use all of this logic. We’ll need a bit more Differential and <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow">Timely</a> (the underlying framework for distributed computation that Differential is built on) to get things going and the final result looks like:</p>
<pre><code>timely::execute_directly(move |worker| {
    let (mut first, mut second) = worker.dataflow(|scope| {
        let (first_handle, first) = scope.new_collection();
        let (second_handle, second) = scope.new_collection();
        let output = first
            .map(|x| (x, ()))
            .semijoin(&amp;second)
            .map(|(x, _)| x)
            .distinct();
        output
            .inspect(|(x, time, m)| println!("x: {} time: {} multiplicity: {}", x, time, m));
        (first_handle, second_handle)
    });

    // Send some sample data to our dataflow
    for i in 0..10 {
        // Advance time to i
        first.advance_to(i);
        second.advance_to(i);

        for x in i..(i + 10) {
            first.insert(x);
            second.insert(x + 5);
        }
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>We need to set up some Timely and Differential boilerplate here to get our computation going. We tell Timely to create a new dataflow graph with the <code>dataflow</code> method and can define our input collections with the <code>new_collection</code> method. <code>new_collection</code> gives us a “handle” which is basically like a pipe that we can use from elsewhere to send data into this collection, and a reference to the collection, that we can use within the closure to implement the actual graph (it’s the same logic as before). The only other novel bit in the closure is the <code>inspect</code> call which lets us print the contents of our collection to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<p>The rest of the code outside of the closure deals with setting up an example. It’s sending integers to <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> at various logical times (based on when we <a href="https://docs.rs/timely/0.11.1/timely/dataflow/operators/input/struct.Handle.html#method.advance_to"><code>advance_to</code></a>) so that we can test out the logic. It’s not immediately obvious from the nested loop but <code>first</code> gets everything in <code>[0, 19)</code> (some of them …</p></div></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There are a ton of free comment widgets available- Facebook comments, Disqus, Livefyre and many more. They're outnumbered by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=using+github+issues+for+blog+comments">blog posts</a> on replacing these bloated, privacy destroyers with a custom systems that use GitHub issues as a backing data store.</p>
<p>Enter <strong><a href="https://utteranc.es/">https://utteranc.es</a></strong>, my take on hosting blog comments on GitHub issues. Lightweight, easy to configure and secure. No need to worry about GitHub API rate limits, managing server-side code, manually linking blog posts to issues or forcing users to leave your site to post a comment.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun building this app, it served as the POC for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs">GitHub issue integration in Microsoft Docs</a>. Much of the GitHub API and OAuth related code is shared. There are some features that haven't made it into docs <em>yet</em> like markdown preview. On the other hand, we've implemented reactions in docs, which hasn't been backported to utterances yet. As of this writing, users have opened <em><a href="https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E%3D2017-12-15+is%3Apublic+in%3Abody+%22Version+Independent+ID%22+-repo%3AMicrosoftDocs%2FSamplesPages+-repo%3Ajdanyow%2Ftest2">more than 2,250 issues</a></em> via the GitHub based feedback system in Microsoft Docs. Pretty crazy. Kudos to the content teams that are keeping up with all the issues!</p>

For the record, at the time of writing, I have published <a href="https://codsen.com/os/#cli-apps">a dozen of CLI's</a>, and while half of them use a colourization helper, the other half does not. Out of those that do, one uses <code>colorette</code>, and 5 are using <code>chalk</code>.</p><p>In my opinion, what matters when choosing one is fundamentals — particularly, do unused "colours" (or any other cruft) end up in your bundle. When you import blue, bold and underline from <code>colorette</code>:</p><div><pre rel="js"><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> blue<span>,</span> bold<span>,</span> underline <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"colorette"</span></code></pre></div><p>only those end up in your bundle.</p><p>But whole <code>chalk</code> will end up in your bundle:</p><div><pre rel="js"><code><span>import</span> chalk <span>from</span> <span>'chalk'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>On the other hand, a) I don't transpile or bundle CLI's at all; and b) <code>chalk</code> seems more developer-friendly. Chained methods get code suggestion hints, compare:</p><div><pre rel="js"><code>chalk<span>.</span>blue<span>.</span>underline<span>.</span><span>bold</span><span>(</span><span>'hi'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><br><span>underline</span><span>(</span><span>bold</span><span>(</span><span>blue</span><span>(</span><span>"hi"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>For the record, there's also <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-red" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>ansi-red</code>&nbsp;<svg height="10" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="m38 30h-38v60h60v-38m-20-52v10l10 10-30 30 20 20 30-30 10 10h10v-50z" fill="none" stroke="#807e79" stroke-width="10" transform="translate(5 5)"></path><title>opens in a new tab</title></svg></a> and bunch, but it seems a bad idea to split colourization wrappers into standalone libraries. What if you change your mind, to use not <code>red</code> but <code>green</code>? Would you replace one dependency with another? In that light, <code>ansi-*</code> group, in my opinion, will never outcompete <code>chalk</code> or <code>colorette</code>.</p><h3 id="colorizing-helpers-are-optional"><a href="#colorizing-helpers-are-optional">§</a> Colorizing helpers are optional</h3><p>It's crucial to dispel any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FUD&nbsp;<svg height="10" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="m38 30h-38v60h60v-38m-20-52v10l10 10-30 30 20 20 30-30 10 10h10v-50z" fill="none" stroke="#807e79" stroke-width="10" transform="translate(5 5)"></path><title>opens in a new tab</title></svg></a> around the terminal colourization subject.</p><p>All it takes to colourize the text in the terminal is to wrap it with two special chunks of text.</p><p>No magic here.</p><p>The frontal part contains a colour code (<code>31</code> for red, <code>32</code> for green and so on), ending part is always <code>39</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Some books are like mirrors. By that I mean that reading them involves a great deal of looking at oneself, both for praise and loathing. Taking a look back in time, reflecting on all those times we thought we were right and we were wrong, bringing back memories of times long gone, some of them painful, most hopefully fun and joyful.</p>
<p>“The Psychology of Computer Programming” is one of those. In every one of its chapters, Dr. Weinberg reflects on the human aspects of programming. It is, most probably, the first book ever written on the subject of the personality, the interactions and the characteristics of software developers. Let me be clear: this book has been written in 1971, and it has been continuously in print until at least the end of the twentieth century, for almost 30 years. This is the stuff of classics.</p>
<p>There has even been a reviewed “anniversary” edition published in 1999, but I bought a copy of the first edition of the book, and besides the delightful look and feel of the pages, representatives of the typography and design of the seventies, the structure, the flow and the discussion of this book make it stand in a class of its own, and represent a hallmark in our field.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Weinberg analyzes programming from both individual and collective points of view, including the issues of education, human resources management, and even programming language design. The author actually devotes a section of his book to explain how the design of a programming language impacts the readability and the subsequent maintainability (or lack thereof) of the programs written in it.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>Regarding team interactions, the author highlights the issues brought from scaling up programming teams: do small teams face the same issues as larger ones? How do communication patterns emerge and evolve? The author takes pleasure in debunking common myths and misconceptions, some of them still held today by managers all over the world: what are the factors that can cause a project to break down in pieces? The answers will surprise you, and you will wonder why nobody had ever told you to read this book first.</p>
<p>Dr. Weinberg also pays close attention to the individual characteristics of programmers. What defines a good programmer? Why do they take pride in their jobs? What kind of incentives should a company offer to their developers? Nice offices or challenging problems? (I think you can guess the answer to that last question.)</p>
<p>In the humble opinion of the author of these lines, software is primarily a social process, and only later a technical feat. Software is no more a technical product than a book is just a printed object. Software is the result of interactions among people, and as such it will reflect all the contradictions, the failures, the wonders and the joy of the people involved in it. Every single piece of software ever written by humans reflects the underlying moods, psyche and interactions of a group of people. As such, studying the psychology of a programmer yields naturally in a process in which, invariably, the software will be better at the end.</p>
<p>I once saw a joke on Twitter, saying that managing programmers was subject to Heisenberg’s Principle, in that observing programmers changes their behavior. I do not think it is a joke, for I believe that all social systems are, actually, quantum-like systems subject to this principle; the actions of the observer will invariably alter the behavior of the observed. And that is OK, as far as I am concerned. If managers are conscious of this fact, and if they can use this to their advantage, they will be able to build sustainable teams.</p>
<p>Maybe Dr. Weinberg took some inspiration from Melvin Conway, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1967 stated</a> that “organizations design systems mirroring their own communication structures”. Now you start to understand why your microservice architecture is a mess, and no, neither Istio nor Prometheus is going to help you with that.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding recruiting: we all know how hard it is to find and recruit software developers, yet I am appalled to see how many companies do as much as they can to destroy the teams they spent so much time and money to build. Why is this? I can only recommend all human resources managers, all project managers, and all developers as well, to get a copy of this book and, as I said at the beginning of this chapter, to take a good look at ourselves in the mirror. We all need a little bit of introspection, and Dr. Weinberg can help.</p>
<p>Legacy buzzword warning: this book is mostly accessible to general audiences, but there are a few sections where the author assumes a certain experience with programming languages, compilers, hardware design or even project management; and in some cases, with the 1971 versions of those.</p>

      <p><img src="https://justanman.org/images/aol-instant-messenger-shuts-down.png" alt="AOL Instant Messenger ‘Running Man’ waving goodbye"></p>
<p>In the early 2000s social media sites like Facebook and Twitter weren’t commonplace yet. Even text messages, at ten cents each, were something to be rationed. For many teenagers the primary means of communication outside school was AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). So when it was announced in October that they were shutting down AIM after 20 years, I felt a wave of nostalgia for the messaging app of my youth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear when they would be pulling the plug for good, but a high school friend and I planned to be online for the occasion. Their website indicated that AIM would continue to work until the morning of December 15, 2017. Assuming this meant UTC time, that put it going offline sometime after 7:00 PM EST on the 14th.</p>
<p>I wondered: Could I be the last person to sign off? The last person to send a message? Would I have anything profound to say?</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I decided to research famous last words. First stop: the Book of Revelation. Final chapter, final verse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Last words are for fools who haven’t said enough!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too cantankerous. And as a somewhat libertarian leaning person, I wasn’t going to let Karl Marx have the last word.</p>
<p>I’d figure out what to say later and in the meantime started reading about the technology behind AIM. I learned about OSCAR, the proprietary protocol used by AIM and ICQ. Parts of the protocol were documented by AOL in an official SDK. This is what made third-party AIM clients possible. I had used Gaim (now Pidgin) on Linux machines before and indeed, there was even BSFlite, an AIM client for the command line.</p>
<p>AOL’s desktop client no longer worked for me. They had already pulled the iOS app from the App Store. Ditto for Android. Fortunately browser sign on still worked. I was greeted by a familiar interface that supported new features like embedded media and SMS.</p>
<p>I sent a couple test messages from the browser to my phone. Monitoring outbound activity in the Chrome network panel revealed the structure of a request: a simple HTTP POST to a url, with what appeared to be a session ID in the query string and a message body. I tried to send a message using <code>curl</code> and it worked. As long as I was signed on in the browser the request was accepted.</p>
<p>There were several paths to automating this but given the time constraint, something quick and easy would probably suffice. All I had to do was keep sending messages until the server stopped responding.</p>
<p><strong>December 14, 2017: The final countdown</strong></p>
<p>It was almost midnight UTC time. It would be the 15th soon and I didn’t want to miss the shutdown, so I set up a Bash script to run the <code>curl</code> command at one second intervals. Every now and then I had to manually reauthenticate in the browser. It wasn’t elegant but it worked. Now I had to wait…</p>
<p>To pass time I searched Twitter for mentions of AIM’s last day. Plenty of people were reminiscing about their old screen names, but only a handful were actually signing on one last time. I added them to my buddy list and we talked for a bit. One lived in DC, one in Toledo. Another somewhere in Maryland. Two were engineers, one was a wrestling announcer! I made dinner and watched <em>The Office</em> while occasionally checking on the script.</p>
<p>It ran for another six hours until 1:21 AM EST. I witnessed the drama play out in HTTP status codes:</p>
<pre><code>200 OK
200 OK
200 OK
408 Request Timeout
408 Request Timeout
401 Unauthorized
</code></pre><p>And like that, AIM was gone. Requests to aim.com returned an Invalid URL status page. <code>curl</code> returned nothing but 401s.</p>
<p><strong>Epitaph</strong></p>
<p>I examined the script logs and found it – the last message sent on AIM. [1] It was timestamped Fri Dec 15 01:21:42 EST 2017. From me, to me. (I didn’t want to spam anyone.)</p>
<p>I had borrowed the words from Leonard Nimoy’s final tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🖖</p>

                    <h3>The curious case of CVE-2020-14381</h3>                    
                    <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of this interesting kernel bug I worked
on last year with <a href="https://twitter.com/bluec0re" target="_blank">@bluec0re</a>,
and as it turns out I wrote something about it during one of these lockdown
weekends so I thought I'd release it. <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2015" target="_blank" title="CVE-2020-14381 get_futex_key use-after-free">The bug itself</a>
was discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">Jann Horn</a>
of Project Zero. While I touch most of the elements required to exploit the
bug, I stay superficial here since the exploit itself is not particularly
exciting. What makes this bug interesting to me is its lifecycle, in particular
how unevenly the patch was applied to the various distributions. I also talk
briefly about hardware side-channels since it was the first time I had ever
used one.</p>

<p><strong>The bug</strong></p><p>It’s already well-described in the bug tracker, but here is another summary.
The <span>futex</span> syscall's main parameter is a userland address, and this address
may belong to a file-backed mapping. In that case, the futex key kernel object
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L707" target="_blank">held</a>
and <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/kernel/futex.c#L724" target="_blank">kept</a>
a reference to the inode object, but didn’t hold a reference to the file’s mountpoint.
If the mountpoint were to go away, its associated kernel structures would be
freed, but the inode wouldn’t. That’s an issue because the inode itself has
fields that point to some of these structures, such as its <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L641" target="_blank">super_block</a>
struct.</p>

<p>Further use of the inode by <span>futex</span> code paths may therefore trigger
use-after-frees. One particular code path highlighted by Jann in the bug happens
when the <span>futex</span> is destroyed: the last reference to the inode is released
and the inode needs to be freed. This is done in <span>iput</span> which then calls
<span>iput_final</span>. <span>iput_final</span> and its subcalls will then call inode
management functions stored in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1942" target="_blank">super_operations</a>
struct accessed <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1533" target="_blank">from the super_block</a>
object. The first instance happens right at the beginning of <span>iput_final</span> with
a call to the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/inode.c#L1539" target="_blank">drop_inode</a>
function.</p>

<p>Exploiting this bug requires being able to:
</p><ul>
  <li>Successfully <span>umount</span> a mountpoint. A no-go a few years ago, but
  possible nowadays with the normalization of unprivileged user namespaces.
  It’s a good example that this feature was never a trivial security tradeoff
  (unprivileged sandboxes v. augmented kernel attack surface) which in turn
  makes it somewhat surprising that all mainstream distributions enabled them by default
  without much debate</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode()</span> execution (non-SMEP or a KASLR bypass)</li>
  <li>Survive the <span>op-&gt;drop_inode</span> indirection just before that (non-SMAP
  or a stack/heap leak)</li>
  <li>Do everything in one call, because with an incorrect inode state, a corrupted
  super_block and some linked lists unlinks to do in the remainder of <span>iput_final</span>,
  it’s doubtful we can even get as far as the second <span>super_operations</span>
  function pointer call (<span>evict_inode</span>)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p><p>The first exploitation pathway that comes to mind goes as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li>wait for the <span>super_block</span> to be freed. It’s done in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/fs/super.c#L299" target="_blank">an RCU callback</a>
  so one way or another you need to wait for the end of the RCU grace period
  after <span>umount</span> returns, e.g. with <span>membarrier</span>. For a PoC, spraying
  allocs for the duration of the expedited grace period works well enough since
  the <span>super_block</span> slab, <span>kmalloc-2k</span>, is not super busy.</li>
  <li>overwrite the freed <span>super_block</span> via a dynamic heap allocation primitive
  (e.g. <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4.7/source/net/socket.c#L2264" target="_blank">sendmsg ancillary data</a>).</li>
  <li>point <span>s_op</span> to an attacker-controlled buffer</li>
  <li>point <span>drop_inode</span> to a chain of gadgets that pivot the stack to
  either the <span>super_block</span> or <span>super_operations</span> bufffers (which
  are both necessarily in registers and almost fully controlled). Example of
  common gadgets that would work in this situation would be <span>push reg; jmp/call [reg+x]</span>
  that can then be chained with a <span>pop rsp; ret</span> gadget placed at <span>[reg+x]</span></li>
  <li>do whatever with your unconstrained ROP, fixup the stack and return</li>
</ul>


<p>This would be a sucky exploit to maintain as it relies on precise knowledge
of the kernel image, but that’s as good as it gets for a raw function pointer
execution without a read primitive in kernel space. The portability issues
for exploits like this are in themselves a significant bonus of SMEP: it rarely
prevents exploitation but makes many candidates much less appealing for weaponization.</p>

<p>We can take SMEP for granted. It’s only one CPU generation / 2 years older
than SMAP, but not having it is getting really rare. Plus if your exploit does
rely on no-SMEP but your target ends up having software SMEP enabled, which
you sometimes can't really tell at runtime, you've just turned a privesc attempt into
a lost foothold. No-SMAP however is still a thing for the time being. As a
random example the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/intel/" target="_blank" title="AWS EC2 intel CPUs">AWS EC2 CPU roster</a>
shows some CPUs that do not support SMAP.</p>

<p><strong>On infoleak bugs</strong></p><p>In any case, to exploit this bug one needs at least one infoleak. The most
important is to get kernel base for gadgets, and then we could use a heap leak
or similar to support SMAP-capable CPUs (to have our "attacker-controlled
buffer" in point 3 above in kernel space). A heap/stack leak can often yield
a .text address as well so having one would kill two birds with one stone.
But, not everyone has the right infoleak in their stash ready to go, contrary
to a common anti-KASLR argument. And even when you do have an infoleak bug,
it doesn't mean that it will help with your current exploit.</p>

<p>For instance, a good infoleak candidate which was released around the same
time last year would be the one with uninitialized memory in coredumps, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10732" target="_blank">CVE-2020-10732</a>.
But short of a public proof-of-concept, one needs to understand the coredump
generation code, then find an object in that slab that allows us to get
.text, and another one to deduce a heap address you control. In short, at least
as much work as the rest of the exploit we are looking at. And that's without
considering that using two bugs in one exploit also means that you need to
take into account both bugs limitations. Unprivileged user namespaces for the
main bug we are looking at (not a thing on e.g. RHEL 7), and for the coredump,
well the ability to retrieve the core files, i.e. not running in a container.
Luckily for our project, we already knew we were targeting non-SMAP containers
so we were able to avoid spending all that effort on an infoleak bug that
would have ended up being worthless; a luxury that real exploit developpers
preparing capabilities ahead of time do not have. But if we were targeting
SMAP containers, well that would have been it since more effort would have
exceeded our resource budget for this project.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware side-channels</strong></p><p>For kernel .text however, the situation is different since there are generic,
publicly-documented ways to obtain kernel base: hardware vulns. I personally
hadn’t ever used any and even saw them as a niche exploitation technique
relying on opaque CPU heuristics that don’t hold across models - not something
to be considered for resilient exploits. I was simply wrong, but thankfully
had access to many specialists (<a href="https://twitter.com/tehjh" target="_blank">@tehjh</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/_fel1x" target="_blank">@_fel1x</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_tsuro" target="_blank">@_tsuro</a>)
who knew better.</p>

<p>While side-channels that allow leaking memory across security boundaries
are hopefully bound to be mitigated, there are many side-channels that leak
addresses and which we haven’t heard much about since Spectre and friends.
These ones are probably here to stay even longer. For this project I used <a href="https://github.com/tpn/pdfs/blob/master/Jump%20Over%20ASLR%20-%20Attacking%20Branch%20Predictors%20to%20Bypass%20ASLR%20-%202016%20(micro16).pdf" target="_blank" title="jump over aslr paper">Jump Over ASLR</a>,
which was published before Spectre in 2016. It’s simple to understand (especially
with access to the aforementioned people) and there are PoCs that are just
waiting to be adjusted to your own scenario (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/felixwilhelm/mario_baslr" target="_blank" title="mario_baslr jump over aslr">mario_baslr</a>
from @_fel1x). Jump Over ASLR relies on the inner workings of the Branch Target
Buffer where user and kernel branches may collide. When that happens, the CPU
has more work to do and that can be observed. This allows leaking kernel base 
as long as you have offsets of branches hit during a short kernel path you
can trigger at will: you can then leverage the low entropy of KASLR to try
all possible base addresses and find the one where the branches are hit.</p>

<p>For the parameters (the branches to measure) you can really use whatever
you want. I only tried the <span>creat</span> syscall with arguments that cause a
fast return to userland, and then measured whether the <span>sys_creat</span> and
<span>do_sys_open</span> offsets had been hit. The offsets need to be fairly precise
but not to the byte since there seems to be some aliasing going on in the branch
predictor: I originally used <span>__fentry__</span> as an additional branch target
at a +5 offset for both symbols which still worked even though I later learned
these calls get <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/747256/" target="_blank">dynamically patched out</a>.
</p>

<p>With proper filtering of both false negatives and false positives (essentially
double checking each address) this works like a charm on recent Intel CPUs,
and it’s one of many such techniques that have been published in the past
6 years or so. That makes it something we should be able to rely on as exploit
developers for the foreseeable future. So for a known kernel image at least,
we are essentially back to pre-KASLR times - and keep in mind that it’s a
field I know fairly poorly so other side-channels are probably even better.</p>

<p><strong>Patch gap</strong></p><p>Ok here is what I personally found really interesting because I had never
looked into kernel bug timelines before. This bug was initially reported on
February 28 2020, and fixed in tip on March 3. At this point it’s essentially
public for anyone keeping an eye out for interesting kernel patches - even
if you don’t spend too much time on it, a <span>reported-by</span> Jann Horn is
worth looking into. The main kernel lines were fixed either on March 25 or
April 2. If you’re thinking “oh wow one whole month”, please be seated for
what’s coming.</p>

<p>Some distros applied the patch almost immediately:
</p><ul>
  <li>Arch Linux: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Gentoo: Mar 25</li>
  <li>Fedora: Mar 26</li>
</ul>


<p>I know they are not supposed to target workstations specifically but outside
of personal servers I don't think I have ever seen them used otherwise. The
2nd batch of distributions that fixed the bug is arguably more server-ready:
</p><ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04 LTS: Apr 7</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: Apr 24</li>
  <li>Debian Buster …</li></ul></div></div>

I don’t expect you’ll be hearing from me less often. In fact, I’m hoping this will allow me to write more. But owing people weekly essays as a matter of business isn’t my tao.

    <p>
This is a big deal.
</p>

<p>
In my day job I work with images captured by cameras, using those images to
infer something about the geometry of the scene being observed. Naturally, to
get good results you need to have a good estimate of the behavior of the lens
(the "intrinsics"), and of the relative geometry of the cameras (the
"extrinsics"; if there's more than one camera).
</p>

<p>
The usual way to do this is to perform a "calibration" procedure to compute the
intrinsics and extrinsics, and then to use the resulting "camera model" to
process the subsequent images. Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_resectioning">an article</a>. And from experience,
the most common current toolkit to do this appears to be <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html">OpenCV</a>.
</p>

<p>
People have been doing this for a while, but for whatever reason the existing
tools <i>all</i> suck. They make basic questions like "how much data should I gather
for a calibration?" and "how good is this calibration I just computed?" and "how
different are these two models?" unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
This is clearly seen from the links above. The wikipedia article talks about
fitting a pinhole model to lenses, even though no real lenses follow this model
(telephoto lenses do somewhat; wider lenses don't at all).
</p>

<p>
And the OpenCV tutorial cheerfully says that
</p>

<pre>Re-projection error gives a good estimation of just how exact the found
parameters are. The closer the re-projection error is to zero, the more accurate
the parameters we found are.
</pre>

<p>
This statement is trivially proven false: throw away most of your calibration
data, and your reprojection error becomes very low. But we can all agree that a
calibration computed from less data is actually worse. Right?
</p>

<p>
All the various assumptions and hacks in the existing tooling are fine as long
as you don't need a whole lot of accuracy out of your results. I need a lot of
accuracy, however, so all the existing tools don't work for my applications.
</p>

<p>
So I built a new set of tools, and have been using them with great delight. I
just got the blessing to do a public release, so I'm announcing it here. The
tools are
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dkogan/mrgingham">mrgingham</a>: a chessboard corner finder. OpenCV has one, but as far as I can
tell, it doesn't work; and it is very slow to tell you that. mrgingham is
relatively quick, robust to all sorts of lens behaviors, and reports the
accuracy of its output. This is a C++ library with Python bindings, and a
commandline tool. 99% of the time the commandline tool is what I use.
</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dkogan/mrcal">mrcal</a>: a large toolkit to run calibrations, to manipulate images and camera
models in all sorts of ways, and to visualize stuff. This toolkit does a
<i>lot</i>. It's a C library and a Python library and a number of commandline
tools. Currently the C library exists primarily in the service of the other
two, but it's already very capable, and will become more so over time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
mrcal does a whole lot to produce calibrations that are as good as possible, and
it will tell you just how good they are, and it includes visualization
capabilities for extensive user feedback. An overview of the capabilities of the
toolkit (with lots of pretty pictures!) is at the <a href="http://mrcal.secretsauce.net/tour.html">tour of mrcal.</a>
</p>

<p>
There's a <i>lot</i> of documentation and examples, but up to now I have been the
primary user of the tools. So I expect this to be somewhat rough when others
look at it. Bug reports and patches are welcome.
</p>

<p>
mrcal is an excellent base, but it's nowhere near "done". The documentation has
some notes about the planned features and improvements, and I'm always reachable
by email.
</p>

<p>
Let me know if you try it out!
</p>

We will also learn how durable and efficient is photovoltaic (PV) technology in extreme weather conditions.</p><h3>Misconception #1: Solar panels don’t function well in winters or cold weather conditions.&nbsp;</h3><p>This is a common misbelief among Photovoltaic technology.  But the fact is, solar panels work fine in cold conditions as they depend upon the light not heat. They work well in cold-condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The low temperature in winters helps the panels to perform <em>better</em>.

As a result, they begin to generate less power from the same amount of sunlight.&nbsp;</p><p>On earth, some areas are vulnerable to freezing temperatures, but as long as the sunlight is falling on the panels, you’ll be generating energy.</p><h3>Misconception #2: Do Photovoltaic&nbsp;cell work in Snow?</h3><p>This is also a misbelief. Yes, they can be in working condition during the snowy season. The amount of power your solar panel generates in snowy regions entirely depends on the quality standard of your panels and how they’re installed.</p><p>The premium panels come with an anti-reflective layer that covers the silicon and helps to melt the snow faster. These premium panels are developed to be in working condition in extreme temperature variations both in hot and cold climates.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-1.png?fit=800%2C503&amp;ssl=1" alt="Solar Panels" height="503" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-1.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-1.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/robologiclab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Untitled-design-1.png?resize=768%2C375&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><h3>Misconception #3: Solar panels and wind don’t mix&nbsp;</h3><p>This is not true at all. A high-graded solar panel is installed so precisely that it should not be affected by strong winds.

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>For a long time, I’ve been curious about something. It is a truth I’ve
seen casually dropped in textbooks, package documentation, and tweets:
<strong>random effects and penalized smoothing splines are the same thing</strong>. 
It sounds so profound and enlightened. What does it mean? How are they
the same? What deep statistical <em>gnosis</em> was I missing out on?</p>

<p>I have spent months, off and on, trying to understand this equivalence.
I can’t give you the full mathematical treatment, but I have the gist of
it and I can point you to the equations. In this post, I will try to 
highlight the connections between the two.</p>

<p>Here are the main takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mixed effects models (a.k.a. hierarchical models or multilevel
models) use partial pooling to strike a balance between a grand
population mean (complete pooling) and individual group means (no
pooling).</li>
  <li>Smoothing splines work by penalizing model coefficients to reduce
the model degrees of freedom.</li>
  <li>You can use the computational machinery of one framework to estimate
the other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mixed-model-review">Mixed model review</h2>

<p>Let’s review what these things means. Mixed effects models,
<a href="https://www.tjmahr.com/another-mixed-effects-model-visualization/">apparently</a> the <a href="https://www.tjmahr.com/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/">main
focus</a> of <a href="https://www.tjmahr.com/iccbot-comes-online/">this
blog</a> over the years, are used to estimate
“random” or “varying” effects. Here is the classic equation set up:</p>

\[\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X\beta} + \mathbf{Zb} + \mathbf{\epsilon} \\
\mathbf{b} \sim \textsf{Normal}(0, \sigma_b) \\
\mathbf{\epsilon} \sim \textsf{Normal}(0, \sigma_y) \\
\mathbf{X}: \textrm{fixed effects model matrix} \\
\mathbf{Z}: \textrm{random effects model matrix} \\
\sigma_b, \sigma_y : \textrm{variance components} \\
\sigma_b : \textrm{where the magic happens} \\\]

<p>The magic here is the <em>σ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, as it ties all of the
individual effects in <strong>b</strong> under a common distribution. If
<em>σ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> were replaced with a fixed number like 10, then all
of the effects in <strong>b</strong> would be independent and unaware of each other:
There would be <em>no pooling</em> of information between the groups. If we
remove it from the model—replace <em>σ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> with 0, so to
speak—then all the group variability is ignored, and there is
<em>complete pooling</em> of information into a single mean effect. With 
<em>σ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> all the groups can contribute information about the 
distribution of plausible effects, and so, there can be 
<em>partial pooling</em> of information between groups.</p>

<p>Consider the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/rstanarm-datasets.html" title="Documentation on the radon dataset"><code>radon</code> dataset</a> example from <a href="https://amzn.to/3aVa9tB" title="An Amazon Affliate link to Gelman and Hill">Gelman and Hill
(2007)</a>. Radon measurements were taken in Minnesota
counties. We would like to estimate the average radon measurement for
each county. We have a repeated measures situation, and some counties
have more observations than others. We use a Bayesian mixed effects
model with <a href="https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms">brms</a> to estimate a
population distribution of county estimates, and the county-level
estimates are randomly varying effects. They are drawn from a random
distribution, the scale of which we estimate from the data.</p>

<p>Here <code>sd(Intercept)</code> corresponds to <em>σ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>.</p>

<p>We can plot the observed county means alongside the model estimated
ones. First, I do some wrangling so that the difference between observed
means and estimated means are computed for use later on.</p>

<p>We see a classic example of partial pooling. First note that model
estimates (blue circles) are less variable: None go above <em>y</em> = 2 and
only four go below <em>y</em> = 1. For counties with many observations (right
side), the estimated mean is hardly adjusted. There is less of a visual
gap between the observed mean and estimated mean. For counties with less
data (left side), the estimate is pulled towards the population mean
(<code>Intercept</code> in the summary above).</p>

<p>The following plot shows difference between the observed means and
the estimated means, subtracting the grey triangles from the blue squares
in the plot above.</p>

<p>The contention behind the <em>smooths = random effects</em> claim is that what we
just did is a case of <em>smoothing</em>. These random effects are, in a way, 
smoothed fixed effects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function <code>random()</code> can be seen as a smoother for use with factors
in <code>gamlss()</code>. It allows the fitted values for a factor predictor to
be shrunk towards the overall mean […]</p>

  <p>— <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/gamlss/man/random.html" title="random: Specify a random intercept model in a GAMLSS formula">GAMLSS documentation</a> describing a random intercept as a smoother</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-whats-smoothing">But what’s smoothing?</h2>

<p>Now let’s walk through a generalized additive model in
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html">mgcv</a> to
demonstrate a penalized smoothing spline. That was a mouth full, but
basically additive models are like the smoothing expansion pack for the
standard linear model. We’re still doing regression, but we have some
new syntax and our models can do nonlinear relationships more easily
now.</p>

<p>I will walk through a basic example of how a spline’s basis functions
are weighted to approximate a nonlinear trend, but this is not going to
be a full tutorial. Other people have made video introductions to
<a href="https://youtu.be/Zxokd_Eqrcg?t=506" title="Dr. Gavin Simpson - Learning When, Where, and by How Much, Things Change [Remote]">additive models</a> or the <a href="https://youtu.be/q4_t8jXcQgc" title="Noam Ross - Nonlinear Models in R: The Wonderful World of mgcv">mgcv package</a>. I first
learned them from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05339" title="Generalised additive mixed models for dynamic analysis in linguistics: a practical introduction">a tutorial for linguists</a> and then from
<a href="https://amzn.to/37PLa8W" title="An Amazon Affliate link to Simon Wood's GAM textbook">the mgcv textbook</a>, but there are <a href="https://github.com/noamross/gam-resources" title="Resources for Learning About and Using GAMs in R">other resources
online</a>.</p>

<p>We use the <a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/MASS/man/mcycle.html" title="Documentation on the mcycle dataset"><code>mcycle</code></a> dataset which gives the head
acceleration in a simulated motorcycle accident. We are going to fit a
model, plot the smooth from it, and then we are going to work through
what the model did.</p>

<p>So what happened here? We will cover it visually.</p>

<h3 id="splines-are-the-sums-of-weighted-wiggles">Splines are the sums of weighted wiggles</h3>

<p>Let’s look at the regression formula.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>formula</span><span>(</span><span>gam_20</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>#&gt; accel ~ 1 + s(times, bs = "cr", k = 20)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We told <code>gam()</code> to estimate <code>accel</code> using an intercept term and a smooth
term on the time predictor (<code>s(times, ...)</code>). Specifically, we created
our smooth using a cubic regression spline basis (<code>bs = "cr"</code>) with <code>k
= 20</code> - 1 curves. Our model is
estimating a function by adding up smaller components called <em>basis
functions</em>, and the space that defines those components is the <em>basis</em>.
These basis functions are weighted and summed together to produce a
smooth trend called a <em>spline</em>. The name <em>splines</em> is inspired by
drafting splines which are flexible strips of wood that can be weighted
and anchored in place to make a nice curve.</p>

<p>To reiterate, conceptually, we are decomposing the <code>times</code> predictor
into a bunch of individual wiggly lines (basis functions), and these are
weighted and summed together to approximate some nonlinear function. My
post on <a href="https://www.tjmahr.com/polypoly-package-released/">orthogonal polynomials</a>
illustrates the same principle but with polynomial basis functions.
Richard McElreath provides <a href="https://youtu.be/ENxTrFf9a7c?t=2226" title="Statistical Rethinking Winter 2019 Lecture 04">a friendly 30-minute introduction
splines</a> in a Bayesian model in his Statistical
Rethinking course. One line I appreciate from his description is that
with splines, we replace a predictor variable, like <code>times</code>, with a set
of “synthetic” predictor variables.</p>

        <p>With Chrome now supporting Animated PNG as of Chrome 59 we have two image formats that can supplant the old and tired GIF format. Varying posts and sites have different conclusions on when to use APNG versus an animated Webp. In all my findings (linked below where the source Gif comes from) animated webp beats apng in filesize each and every time. Sometimes by not very much. This of course is anecdotal and I'm not as familiar with apng as the creators and others may be so they may be able to squeeze more out of an apng than I can.</p>

<p>All that being said I've heard and read people say "APNG might be bigger but webp takes longer to decode in the browser". That assumes the larger APNG will load faster than the smaller webp. Is that the case though? I assume the smaller webp gets downloaded to the client faster then it'll start decoding faster. Thus animating faster. So lets actually test that instead of me spouting off haha. On to the source GIF.</p>

<p>The GIF I'm using for this post comes from my post on <a href="https://corydowdy.com/blog/converting-mp4-to-webm">Converting MP4 To Webm <span>&nbsp;</span></a>. That was a 1080p video stripped down to about 5 seconds and resized to a width of 800.</p>

<p>Here are the relevant details of the unoptimized GIF:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dimensions: 800x450</li>
    <li>Length: 5s</li>
    <li>Size: ≈37.9MB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Before we can even embark on this trip we have to convert the GIF above to an APNG and an Animated Webp. Maybe you can convert the GIF on this page to an APNG and get better results. Please try I don't want to dismiss APNG as much as I think I'm probably coming off as.</p>

<h3>Converting to an Animated PNG (apng)</h3>

<p>Gif2apng offers three different options for converting a GIF to an animated PNG. We have zlib, 7zip and Zopfli compression. Each compression option besides zlib allows you to set an iteration amount which defaults to 15.</p>

<p>I'm using gif2apng version 1.9 <a href="#footnotes-apng">[ 1 ] [ 2 ]</a>. For both 7zip and zopfli I'll use the "default" iterations of 15 and a more aggressive version of 100. Be warned if you want to do this. Depending on your server specs or locally on your own computer and it's specs Zopfli will take a long time. Increasing the iterations for either of the compression algorithms will also increase how long it takes to convert your image to an APNG. Be prepared to set aside a pretty big chunk of time if you do this on your computer :).</p>

<p>After converting the GIF to an Animated PNG I'll also run it through APNGOPT. This should "optimize" the Animated PNG. This too offers differing amount of iterations. I'll use the "default" of 15 for each apng that was converted with the defaults above and 100 for all the 100 iterations.</p>

<h4>APNG Filesize Results</h4>



<p>We can see that Zopfli compression saves the most before running these through apngopt. It's very CPU intensive though. After running these through apngopt things didn't change much or at all.</p>

<h5 id="apng-footnote-label">APNG Footnotes</h5>

<ol id="footnotes-apng">
<li>On a windows machine just use the GUI they package from sourceforge. It seems to be the most up to date. I haven't had the time to see if the GUI and CLI differ in anyway so that'll be up to you unless you're ok with the output of the GUI then keep on keepin on!</li>
    <li>If you install gif2apng through your OS's package manager (ie: apt-get/apt) depending on your OS's you'll more than likely get version 1.7.</li>
    <li>Depending on your OS again if you use the CLI version of apngopt you'll get versions ranging from 1.1 to 1.4.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Animated Webp</h2>

<p>The same reference gif was converted to a webp using three different options and WebP Encoder version: 0.6.0 (WebP Mux version: 0.4.0).</p>

<p>I didn't dive into the different CLI options available for gif2webp. Things such has <code> -kmin </code> , <code> -kmax </code> — which specify the minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key frames and can improve decoding performance — or adjust the deblocking filter <code> -f </code> from the docs suggested 50. These could with adjustments and tweaking produce smaller or in some instances bigger files. You'll have to test those out for specific images, or use the defaults such as I have.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/apngwebp/squirrel.default.webp">It's default settings (quality 75) <span>&nbsp;</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/apngwebp/squirrel.q70.m6.webp">quality of 70 and 6 (-m 6) for the compression mode. It's highest.<span>&nbsp;</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/apngwebp/squirrel.q70.webp">A quality of 70 with default compression of 4 (lossless)<span>&nbsp;</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/apngwebp/squirrel.q70.mixed.webp">an unfair mixed mode (lossless and lossy compression) with a quality of 70<span>&nbsp;</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pullzone1-corydowdywebdesi.netdna-ssl.com/assets/blog/apngwebp/squirrel.q70.m6.mixed.webp">another unfair Quality 70 with Commpression of 6 &amp; Mixed compression (lossy and lossles)<span>&nbsp;</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Webp at it's default settings beats (barely) each of the converted APNG's, 30.86MB for the Webp compared to 33.01MB using default APNG settings (zlib) and 30.87MB using zopfli compression @ 100 iterations.</p>

<p>Ok cool all the file size mumbo jumbo is out of the way. Does a few kb/mb matter when they are so close? The default webp settings gives us the same size file of an apng using apngout and zopfli @ 100 iterations.</p>

<p>Yep. The larger apng will in fact decode faster. But does that matter? Kind of.</p>
<!-- /#setup --><h2>Summoning the WebPageTest Gods!</h2>

<p>Typically in a situation like this I would use <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/video/">Webpagetest's "visual comparison" <span>&nbsp;</span></a> option that way we could see the pages load side by side. I'd run a desktop test and then I'd run a mobile test using the "emerging markets" settings. I can't right now since as mentioned above APNG support is in Chrome 59+. The visual comparison tool uses the current stable release of Chrome (which just happened to be updated while I was testing these out. Still to be sure I ran with the Canary version). What most everyone using a non dev/beta version of Chrome uses.</p>

<p>So I'm running these tests on Chrome Canary and will use the median from the first view as the comparison. I'll run each image option/type three (3) times on Chrome desktop using a cable connection — 5Mbps 28ms Latency — and three times using a Fourth Generation Moto G and their "Mobile 3g" connection — 768 Kbps 3G connection with 300ms of latency.</p>
<h3>Webp Defaults vs. Best Animated PNG</h3>

<p>The first comparison I ran is the default settings of gif2webp. As mentioned above this defaults to a quality of 75, compression mode of 4 and is lossless like APNG. You can download these animated images and run them yourself. You'll see which actually loads faster without even having to read haha.</p>

<p>Webp at it's default settings might in fact be smaller in file size (for this particular animation) than the APNG. It helps in the fact that we are sending less bytes down the wire but as for over all page load performance you can see below it's not helping much or if any at all.</p>

<p>Here we can see the visual differences between both of these formats.</p>



<p>These are large files. You're doing yourself and your users a disservice if you send these big honking things down the wire to them.</p>

<h3>Webp and APNG on Mobile 3g Connection</h3>

<p>Webp's defaults will help you out on a a slow 3g connection because it's sending less data. APNG gets frames faster to the screen since it decodes faster, hence the better speed index below.</p>

<p>So don't use APNG nor the Webp Defaults on a slow connection in my opinion. They are big files.</p>

<h2>Your Best Bet</h2>

<p>So is there a solution for smaller file size than gif and that actually helps your page performance? Yes if you don't mind a possible lossy compressed image.</p>

<p>We can take the Webp image converted with the defaults, the mixed compression (lossy &amp; lossless), the lossy converted webp, and a lossy compressed and filtered webp image and compare those to the "best" file size wise APNG and an unoptimized GIF.</p>

<p>Before I show you those here are the numbers from those runs on a desktop.</p>

<p>What I was most surprised by was how close a default settings animated webp and an unoptimized gif page load times and speed index were.</p>

<p>These aren't fair comparision to APNG either since there is lossy compression. There's also high variance in the load times. Much like you'd have in a real world scenario. So take these results with a grain of salt. I didn't put much effort into making them all variable free.</p>

<h3>APNG and Webp Mobile 3g</h3>

<p>Where you'll get the most benefit with this animated webp is on a slow 3g connection.</p>

<p>In 2019, when I left NVIDIA, I wrote <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2019/12/23/leaving-nvidia-lessons.html">Lessons learned after my first full-time job</a> about leaving a big company for a startup.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve left my first full-time job at a startup, I want to revisit the topic. This is based on some personal experience, but most come from friends’ experiences, including the intensive note on startups from a friend who had worked at 3 startups before and who would like to remain anonymous. I hope that it’ll give some pointers to those trying to decide whether to take the leap.</p>

<p>Some asked if this post is about Snorkel. It’s not. Snorkel is an exception. It’s a great startup, which is a reason why I joined in the first place, and I recommend it to all my friends who are looking to join a startup.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</p>

  <li>Each of the points below is true for many startups, but not for all startups, and it’s more true for early-stage startups (e.g. before series B). There are always exceptions, extreme exceptions, unreasonable exceptions, which make the startup world so exciting.</li>
  <li>A friend told me that these points are only true for bad startups. Most startups are, unfortunately, bad startups.</li>

<h2 id="why_not_join_a_startup">7 reasons not to join a startup</h2>

<h3 id="1_work_life_balance">Reason 1. Goodbye work-life balance</h3>

<p>A friend at a tech giant told me that he and his co-workers once mused about how long they could go on not working until someone noticed. The answers were between a week and two months. At an early-stage startup, the answer is likely a couple of hours.</p>

<p>My transition from NVIDIA to Snorkel was a culture shock. At NVIDIA, you can have a predictable schedule, e.g. coming in at 9am and leaving at 6pm every day. If you don’t finish something by Friday afternoon, just push the deadline to next week and go to happy hour. It’s okay, even expected, to not check emails or Slack for the entire weekend.</p>

<p>On my first day at Snorkel, when I left at 7pm, I was the first one to leave.</p>

<p>Nobody told me how to spend my time, but when everyone else worked over the weekend and responded to my Slack messages any time of the night, I wanted to do the same. Nobody forced me to take on a hefty task that would require me to cancel plans with friends, but I also knew that everybody else had their hands full and if I didn’t do it, we wouldn’t be able to finish this feature on time and the company would lose a contract or even die.</p>

<p>By the time that I left, the work-life balance had got a lot more balanced. Snorkel had hired a ton more people to share the workload and we had worked out processes to speed things up.</p>

<p>In general, I’ve observed that the bigger the startup, the better the work-life balance. Possible explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The earlier the startup, the more precarious its survival, and the harder everyone has to push.</li>
  <li>In very early-stage startups, the working culture is dominated by those with high ownership in the company (the founding team), who are incentivized to work harder. Later on, the working culture is dominated by people with much lower ownership in the company (e.g. 0.1% over 4 years for the 20th engineer vs. 20% for the founder), who are more incentivized to keep a work-life balance.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: The work-life balance at an early-stage startup depends a lot on how much the existing team members work. When interviewing at a startup, don’t ask the founders how much they value work-life balance (they’ll say “A lot”), but ask every team member you can talk to how much they work. If all of them work during evenings and weekends, you might likely feel pressured to do the same.</p>

<h3 id="2_bad_engineering">Reason 2. You’ll pick up bad engineering practices</h3>

<p>Consider the following scenario. A customer requires a new feature and you have to deliver it in a week. This feature is similar to one of your existing features, so the best solution is to refactor the existing code to allow some of it to be reused.</p>

<p>However, refactoring alone would require a week. Your tech lead decides that you should just duplicate the existing code and turn it into a new feature. Now you have two massive code structures that are similar but not quite. When making changes to one structure, you have to remember to change the other too.</p>

<p>Then, somebody forgets and a wild bug appears. The person assigned to fix it isn’t given a lot of time, so instead of investigating the duplicate code, they write a hacky function on top.</p>

<p>Startups build 1 from 0, something from nothing. <em>Adding new things fast</em> takes precedence over both <em>adding good things slow</em> and <em>fixing existing things</em>. You might get used to writing quick and dirty code, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult programming</a>, merging code that has no tests, merging before tests complete, committing without comments, spaghetti code, magic numbers.</p>

<p>Bad practices might be a mere dissatisfaction at first, but can gradually become a habit, then become the only way you know how to work.</p>

<h3 id="3_mentorship">Reason 3. Less mentorship</h3>

<p>The thing I missed the most when leaving NVIDIA was mentorship. Large companies, by virtue of having a lot of employees, tend to have many people whose diverse life experience can provide you invaluable advice. At NVIDIA, I could come to my mentors for questions from general career dilemmas to obscure engineering knowledge. Once in a while, I browsed the org chart of tens of thousands of employees, identified people I want to learn from, and asked them to meet at the coffee machine, which they usually accepted.</p>

<p>Startups don’t have that many people for you to reach out to in the first place. Your handful of coworkers might have backgrounds and experiences similar to yours (cue founders who say they prefer hiring from their existing networks) and are unlikely to give you dramatically different perspectives. Even if there are people who could mentor you, given the pace at which startups move, they might not have the time for it.</p>

<p>To be clear, you can still learn a lot from your coworkers at startups, just a different kind of learning.</p>

<h3 id="4_equity">Reason 4. You won’t get rich</h3>

<p>Despite a plethora of articles warning people that joining startups is a bad way to get rich (<a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">1</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">2</a>, <a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/sorry-startup-employee-100-your-equity-probably-won-t-make-you-rich-d6549ece71bd">3</a>), many people still think joining a startup is a get-rich-quick scheme. Here’s the gist of the math. Imagine you’re an <strong>engineer with 2-3 years of experience</strong>.</p>

<p>If you join a startup as the <strong>15th engineer</strong> (not executive), your compensation might look like the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Base salary</strong>: Your base salary is usually lower than you would have got at a big company (e.g. <strong>$120K instead of $160K</strong>) because at startups, equity makes a large chunk of your compensation.</li>
  <li><strong>Equity</strong>: You might get <strong>0.05% - 0.25%</strong> equity vested over <strong>4 years</strong>. After subsequent fundraising rounds, this amount of equity is diluted to <strong>0.02% - 0.1% for 4 years</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<strong>If you join late at the startup (say employee number 100+), even if the company succeeds wildly, your equity will be worth very little.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to get rich, join a big company and climb their rank. You can find the detailed analysis of compensations for 19,000 FAAAM-dominated tech workers <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/01/18/tech-workers-19k-compensation-details.html">here</a>, but below is a plausible, even conservative, scenario if you join a company like Google with 2-3 years of experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st year, L4 $250K/year.</li>
  <li>2nd year, L4, $280K/year.</li>
  <li>3rd year, L4, $320K/year.</li>
  <li>4th year, L5, $360K/year.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the first 4 years at Google, you’ve already made over $1 million, not counting “perks” like work-life balance.</p>

<h3 id="5_management">Reason 5. Bad management</h3>

<p>There’s a trend among startups to not fixate on titles until they have to. Some avoid “manager” to not endanger the “everyone is equal” mindset (protip: everyone isn’t equal at startups – some have much more equity than others). In the early stage of a startup (e.g. before the 20th employee), there might not be anyone with “manager” in their title. If you join during that phase, you’re expected to get things done with little to no guidance.</p>

<p>Even if your startup has managers, they are likely bad managers. A startup’s first managers are likely its founding team who might have little to no real-world working experience, let alone managerial experience (e.g. recent dropouts, recent graduates). It doesn’t mean that people without working experience can’t be good managers (I know a few), it’s just more rare.</p>

<p>Bad management can manifest in the lack of feedback. At startups, you might get a lot of work-specific feedback – demos, design docs, even code (though it might not be good feedback) – because people at startups are generally more invested in the company. However, you won’t get much you-specific feedback that can help you grow such as what skills you’re lacking or what you need to do to get to the level you want to get to.</p>

<p>Even if there are processes in place for feedback, everyone might be too caught up in sprinting to think about you, what you want, or what opportunities they can give you to grow.</p>

<p>Bad management can be especially frustrating during conflicts, which will inevitably arise when you work in a high-stress environment (e.g. you’re all trying to push a feature at 11pm on a Saturday, everyone is tired and snappy). When something bothers you, you might feel like there’s no one you can talk to because you either …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>
    Kernel density estimation is a really useful statistical tool
    with an intimidating name.
    Often shortened to <strong>KDE</strong>, it’s a technique
    that let’s you create a smooth curve given a set of data.</p><p>This can be useful if you want to visualize just the
    “shape” of some data, as a kind of continuous replacement for the discrete histogram.
    It can also be used to generate points that
    <em>look like they came from a certain dataset</em> - this behavior can power simple
    simulations, where simulated objects are modeled off of real data.</p><p>I hope this article provides some intuition for how KDE works.
  </p></div><div><p>
    To understand how KDE is used in practice, lets start with some points. The white circles on
    your screen were sampled from some unknown distribution.</p><p>As more points build up, their silhouette will roughly correspond to that distribution, however
    we have no way of knowing its true value.
  </p></div><div><p>
    The <span>blue line</span> shows an estimate of the underlying distribution, this is what KDE produces.</p><p>The KDE algorithm takes a parameter, <em>bandwidth</em>, that affects how “smooth” the resulting
    curve is. Use the control below to modify bandwidth, and notice how the estimate changes.</p><p>Bandwidth: <span>0.05</span></p></div><div><p>
    The KDE is calculated by weighting the distances of all the data points we’ve seen
    for each location on the <span>blue line</span>. If we’ve seen more points nearby, the estimate is
    higher, indicating that probability of seeing a point at that location.</p><p>Move your mouse over the graphic to see how the data points contribute to the estimation —
    the “brighter” a selection is, the more likely that location is.
    The <span>red curve</span> indicates how the point distances are weighted, and is called the <em>kernel function</em>. The points are colored according to this function.</p><p><em>Click to lock the kernel function to a particular location.</em>
  </p></div><div><p>
    Changing the bandwidth changes the shape of the kernel: a lower bandwidth means only points very close to the current position are given any weight, which leads to the <span>estimate</span> looking squiggly; a higher bandwidth means a shallow kernel where distant points can contribute.</p><p>Bandwidth: <span>0.05</span></p><p>Next we’ll see how different kernel functions affect the estimate.
  </p></div><div><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h5>Austen Allred is the CEO and founder of Lambda School, a unique coding school that pioneered the ‘income-sharing agreement’ (ISA) model, whereby students only pay if they’re hired in their field of study. Lambda came out of incubator Y Combinator, before which he lived in his two-door Honda Civic and scalped soccer tickets at Stanford Stadium to get by. Prior to Bay Area entrepreneurship, he did a two-year mission to the Ukraine where he learned Russian and knocked on lots of doors. The interview was conducted via Zoom with Austen in Southern Utah, from where he routinely tweets out enviable photography of Utah’s stunning landscape.</h5><p><strong>Your posts are some of the most uplifting things in my feed. They’re either screenshots from an internal Slack or a retweet, and it’s a Lambda student saying: I went from making $20,000 in some service job, and now I'm making $80,000/year doing something technical at (say) Cisco, and you've totally changed my life. </strong></p><p><strong>One thing you often post that I think isn’t obvious to people who don't run a socio-economic escalator is all the necessary polish and look-and-feel of being part of the bougie techie class. For example, how you have this email protocol to set up a meeting. Or that if you think you're underpaid, you go in and you say, </strong><em><strong>screw you, pay me more or I leave</strong></em><strong>. It's intriguing that you don’t only have to educate them to turn them into front end engineers, you also have to teach them the social skills around that to become that bougie techie person.</strong></p><p>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. It's very clear in all these protocols that we have in tech that you and I understand, you have to learn them the hard way. I'll give you a couple of examples. When I was in sixth grade, I was selling stuff on eBay. I was just this kid trying to hustle, and I had this mentor/entrepreneur who came into high school every now and then and just talked with us. And I was like, okay, real talk! What do I need to do to be taken seriously, because nobody takes me seriously because I'm a 15-year-old kid? And he sat me down and he said: <em>We are going to start using this thing called Gmail</em>. <em>I'm going to send you an invite, and you're going to set up firstname.lastname@gmail.com, no numbers, no nonsense, nothing else, you're going to have no signature, and you're only ever going to send text emails for the rest of your life.</em> <em>That's step one</em>. He just walked me through all this really, really basic stuff. </p><p>There was this other time I was in college…I was hustling and trying to get into startups and there was this guy at a conference I wanted to work with, so I went up and talked to him. And I said <em>what can I do to be like you? </em>He gave me his business card and said <em>just ping me next week</em>. </p><p>I spent hours and hours and hours looking up what <em>ping me</em> meant. I couldn't find anything. So eventually I called somebody and said <em>hey, this guy said ping me. What does that mean?</em> <em>How do I ping? </em>And that person was like, <em>no, no, it’s a call or an email or anything really, just reach out to them. Doesn’t matter how.</em> <em>That's all that ping means</em>. <em>You know, like a cell tower. Ping!</em> I was like, <em>ohhhhhhhh!</em> There's so much little stuff like that. Another classic example is intros, right? Or using Google Calendar. I didn't know how to use Google Calendar until I showed up in my first job. Someone tells me, <em>I am gonna put some time on your calendar</em>. And I think: <em>Oh, I guess I have a calendar</em>. That's not obvious if you don't come from, frankly, a certain class. But all of those things are important; if you don't intro somebody the right way to a VC, they know you're a dunce, automatically. There’s nobody that sits you down and says <em>hey, you're gonna say thank you so-and-so, moving you to BCC</em>. It's not hard, but nobody ever tells you that anywhere.</p><h4>I've heard it described as ‘the bottom 1000 universities’: Assume there's some algorithm that spits out the combination of <em>is expensive</em> and <em>is ineffective</em>. There are at least 1000 universities in the US that should cease to exist. There are many universities that net do more harm than good.</h4><p><strong>There's no tech charm school that teaches you how to do all that stuff.</strong></p><p>Totally. And I'm sure there's more stuff. When one of our first students got hired at Uber, he showed up with his laptop. They tell him: <em>you're a mobile developer</em>. And he's like, <em>I can't be a mobile developer, I don't have a phone</em>. He didn't have a smartphone. So he called me freaking out: <em>What am I gonna do!? Uber wants to hire me. I don't have a smartphone.</em> I told him: <em>Uber does not care about that, Uber’s gonna have a thousand phones, that's the least of Uber’s worries. They're gonna give you a laptop too.</em> </p><p>Then he shows up to work on day one and they tell him: <em>Alright, you know, put in your bank account information here to get direct deposit.</em> He's like, <em>no just cut me a check and I’ll run to the check-cashing store.</em> </p><p>The Uber people reached out to me and said: <em>We don’t know if this is going to work.</em> I was like, <em>he's a smart guy, it’s just that he doesn't have a bank account</em>. So now we set up bank accounts for every student that doesn't have a bank account. The best way I think to describe Lambda School is the American-Dream-as-a-service. </p><p><strong>Wow. That’s the corporate anthem right there.</strong></p><p>(Laughs.)</p><p><strong>There so much cultural encoding in an interview which, as you said, is just filtering for class. But…as these are technical people, there’s actually an objective standard of merit. </strong></p><p>There are a whole swath of white collar jobs that the interview process literally is like, <em>Hey, I'm gonna play a little verbal tennis with you and see if you can stand your ground and if you can, you get the job</em>. That's probably the average white collar job.</p><h4>That's one of the really weird things: The hiring process is not just a filter for skills, it's also a filter for class. And people don't talk about or acknowledge that. </h4><p><strong>Speaking of other jobs, do you see Lambda expanding to other fields? Is that even possible? </strong></p><p><strong>The thing that obviously aligns incentives is to look at education as a hard-nosed business proposition. I'm sure you personally care, but the reason why you care as a business owner is because you want them to get the job because otherwise you're not gonna get paid, right? You’ve invested a year and a half in this person, and they can't blow it up because they don’t know about direct deposits, so you fix that. Which is good, and certainly a lot better than the business model universities have. But that model only works if there's some pretty predictable future stream of income along with pretty predictable employment demand. Can you imagine non-technical professions like trucking and nursing that have high demand and high wages? </strong></p><p>The cool thing about the incentive alignment is that we're not going to train you to be a sociologist, because it just doesn't work. A common critique of the ISA model is: <em>oh, now people aren't going to study poetry anymore.</em> And my response to that is: <em>yeah, we're not a university, we're a trade school</em>. The university has 18 million things that it does for you, and we cut cut off a tiny sliver of that, which is: we're going to help you get a better job, we're going to help you improve your state in life. That's all we do. </p><p>There are actually more high-paying jobs available than there are people to fill those roles. And that's true all over the place. I think about it as an optimization problem. You've got all this latent human potential, and it's just kind of bouncing around. Sometimes it goes to school, and it picks stuff at random to study, and you know what you know because of who you’re surrounded by.</p><p>One aspect of Lambda School that I think is underappreciated is a whole lot of people come in having no idea of what software is, having no idea that there's such a thing as a software engineer. We have people who join and think it's like, <em>I'm gonna fix printers</em>. They know that tech is a high-paying field, but they're not surrounded it. If you're in the inner city, or in a rural area, you don't know a computer programmer. </p><p>One way to think about Lambda is like fintech: You have all these transactions that are moving all over the place, but what makes it all work is a clearinghouse that moves all the money to where it needs to go. I think of Lambda as kind of an economic clearinghouse: Here's all of the untapped human potential, here's all the would-be labor, and over here’s all the jobs that need to be done. There's nothing connecting the two right now other than sheer happenstance and going to university, or maybe you hear that there's a good job over here somewhere.</p><p>But right now the situation is not: <em>I'm making $50k, here's my skill set and my interest, I want to make $90k</em>. Somebody should be able to tell you how to do that, and right now, nobody can. That’s crazy. More than half of GDP is just people working, and that's completely unoptimized. </p><p><strong>Right. Even I, who came from a middle-class background and went to the university track, it seemed like a recently poorly-managed process and I only ended up in science and technology by sheer happenstance…</strong></p><p>You stumbled in, yeah? I feel the same way, and the interesting thing now is, depending on which way you happen to stumble, you can end up fabulously rich or destitute based on your stumblings. </p><h4>The other broken piece is the notion that you go to school once for 10 years when you're 18, and you'll be able to ride that for the rest of your career. That’s probably false for a whole lot of people.</h4><p><strong>So this model you’re describing, where you basically connect people from one income level to another higher one via various different processes. I’m curious what other connections you can imagine existing. </strong></p><p>The way to answer that is to see where all the shortages are, where are people trying to hire and those people don’t exist? Tech is an obvious one, but it’s all over the place in …</p></div></div>

producing cells in my pancreas. Insulin is what helps your body use the energy (glucose) in the food you eat. To manage
this disease I use some extremely cool pieces of technology. One is a continuous glucose monitor called a <strong>Dexcom</strong>
CGM. I wear this CGM on my body, and it measures the amount of glucose in my interstitial fluid (also known as the
fluid between cells) every 5 minutes. That data is then sent to my phone (even allowing me to view my real time
glucose on my Apple Watch!) as well as my insulin pump. This data, as well as other information is used to help manage
my Diabetes.</p><p>It has been my personal experience, that when I exercise, I tend to have higher insulin sensitivity, usually meaning
better blood glucose numbers throughout the day. Your blood glucose is what your body automatically regulates on its
own with insulin, but must be done manually as a type 1 diabetic.</p><p>The goal of this exercise is to see if I can pull that correlation out with data, and possibly see if I can use a
Machine Learning Model to predict which days I exercised, based only off my glucose data.</p><hr><p>The source of the exercise data will be Apple HealthKit. Apple HealthKit automatically has my exercise data in it from when I
track workouts on my Apple Watch. It also can be configured to sync with the Dexcom iOS app. So now lets see if we can download and load
that data.</p><h2 id="export-data-from-phone">Export data from phone:</h2><ul><li>Navigate to health app</li><li>click on your profile icon</li><li>scroll to bottom and click export all health data</li><li>this may take a few minutes</li><li>download zip</li><li>expand zip</li><li>this data is pretty sensitive, so don’t commit it to git!</li></ul><pre><code>import sys

                <section id="post-body">
                    <h2 id="non-reasons">Non reasons</h2>
<p>Let me first mention reasons that <em>aren’t</em> why I’m writing posts on this blog</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming a thought leader. My readership is pretty low, unless it reaches the top of HN/reddit. That has only happened a couple of times, so I’m not sure I can replicate it.</li>
<li>Becoming a paid writer. No one is paying for my opinions on things. Especially not when there isn’t a clear theme to my writing other “whatever is on my mind right now”</li>
<li>My social circle thinking of me as “well read” or “intelligent”. I’m honest enough to admit that the opinions of my peers matter to me, but few friends read this blog so it doesn’t make a difference.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h2>
<ol>
<li>To stop ideas rattling in my head. Most of these posts start as half formed abstract ideas. I keep dwelling on them till they become more corporeal. I can’t control this. This bouncing does refine the ideas, but slower than if I had gone through the writing process. When I’m done writing, I’m able to set the idea aside and stop thinking about it. That’s a relief sometimes, especially if it’s a subject that has been upsetting me.</li>
<li>These ideas aren’t fleshed out or even coherent. Sometimes they’re a feeling, a conviction that something has to be so without any words backing it up. Writing forces me to state the hypothesis, gather the evidence and make the case for it.</li>
<li>I edit the posts a couple of times, removing unnecessary words, sentences and phrases. I rewrite unclear passages and remove superfluous ones. I force myself to use simple language because that makes me think clearly. Only when there is nothing left to delete am I satisfied. I can edit written words in a way that thoughts can’t be. I find Orwell’s <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/">recommendations</a> and <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway’s style guide</a> helpful here.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="potential-benefits">Potential benefits</h2>
<p>Apart from immediate peace of mind there are some benefits to this I could reap.</p>
<ul>
<li>My memory is unreliable and malleable. I know why I believe the things I do today, but I don’t remember how those views evolved. What conversations led to them? What books, articles and people influenced my thinking? I didn’t keep a record, and can only vaguely recall answers to those questions. For example, I used to oppose reservation (aka affirmitive action) when I was younger. Now I support it. I don’t know when I changed my opinion or what triggered the change.</li>
<li>In 10 years, I’ll be surprised if my views on some things hasn’t changed. In 20 years, I’ll be disappointed if nothing has changed. It would mean that I’ve stagnated intellectually, learned nothing new that forced me to re-evaluate my beliefs. A written record makes it easier to chart this evolution.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>Instead of writing, I could keep a journal that would achieve most of the same effect. However, I put more effort into posts I publish. I spend time editing them, which I never do with notes. That’s why the quality of posts is higher than my notes, even though I put out the occasional turd.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="potential-downsides">Potential downsides</h2>
<p>It could ossify my thoughts. I mentioned earlier that I stop thinking about topics I’ve already written about. That might not be a good thing if it means my views on that topic stop evolving. I might also be reluctant to change my views from something I’ve publicly soft committed to on a post, to avoid looking like I’m flip flopping.</p>
<p>With any luck, my awful memory will help here. I’ll forget the posts I’ve written so I can think about them anew from fresh angles.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope I keep writing and reading. I hope I keep changing my mind as I learn new things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the facts change I change my mind. What do you do?</p>

<p>The Lisp Machine manual describes both the language and the operating system

is completely documented
by this manual.  The software environment and operating-system-like parts of
the system contain many things which are still in a state of flux.
This manual confines itself primarily to the stabler parts of the
system.  It describes how to program, but not for the most part how to
operate the machine.  The window system is documented separately in
the Lisp Machine Window System manual.

<p>The Lisp Machine is a product of the efforts of many people too
numerous to list here and of the former unique unbureaucratic,
free-wheeling and cooperative environment of the M.I.T. Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory.  I believe that the commercialization of
computer software has harmed the spirit which enabled such systems to
be developed.  Now I am attempting to build a software-sharing movement to
revive that spirit from near oblivion.
</p>

<p>Since January 1984 I have been working primarily on the development of
GNU, a complete Unix-compatible software system for standard hardware
architectures, to be shared freely with everyone just like EMACS.
This will enable people to use computers and be good neighbors legally
(a good neighbor allows his neighbors to copy any generally useful
software he has a copy of).  This project has inspired a growing
movement of enthusiastic supporters.  Just recently the first free
portable C compiler compiled itself.  If you would like to contribute
to GNU, write to me at the address above.  Restrain social decay--help
get programmers sharing again.

<p>Conceptually, if we want two computer systems to communicate with each other,
all we need is a data link over which we can send a series of bits. This is
exactly what serial interfaces do. You can probably quickly imagine a simple
and effective scheme to send a series of bits in order, which is precisely why
there are a thousand different standards, many of them are confusingly similar
to each other, and the most popular are remarkably complex.</p>
<p>So, in this message, I will try to break down what exactly a "serial port" is.
I will only be talking about the hardware standards in this case, not the
software side of a COM port in Windows or a tty device in Unix derivatives.
That's an interesting topic, and I hope to write about it some time, but it
will be A Whole Thing. The software situation is at least as complicated as the
hardware side.</p>
<p>With that warning in place, let's look at this strictly from a consumer
perspective. Most computer users, or at least those with experience working
with serial ports, are familiar with serial in the form of a DE9[1] connector,
and often as opposed to a parallel port, which uses a truly enormous DB25
connector in order to send eight bits at a time. These were the two primary
peripheral interfaces of old computers. Actually, that's not quite true; it's
more accurate to say that these two were the primary peripheral interfaces
of early personal computers that managed to survive into the modern era,
basically because they were adopted by various iterations of the IBM PC, which
is the platonic ideal of a personal computer.</p>
<p>To simplify the history somewhat, the pseudo-standard parallel port was
designed in order to simplify the construction of printers. Although that
advantage basically disappeared as printer technology changed, parallel ports
remained conventional for printers for many years after. In practice they had
few advantages over serial connectors and so basically died out with the
printers that used them. We should all be glad, the time it took to send a
rasterized page to a laser printer over a parallel interface was truly
infuriating.</p>
<p>It would be surprising to run into a parallel interface in use these days,
although I'm sure there are a few out there. It is quite common, though, to
find serial ports today. They're remarkably durable. This is partially because
they are extremely simple, and thus inexpensive to implement. It is mostly
because they are predominantly used by the kind of industries that love to
have weird proprietary connectors, and serial is the ultimate way to have a
weird proprietary connector, because it is one of the least standardized
standards I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Serial ports on computers are vaguely related to an EIA/TIA standard called
RS-232. In fact, a number of computers and other devices label these ports
RS-232, which is a bold move because they are almost universally non-compliant
with that specification. There are usually several ways that they violate the
standard, but the most obvious is that RS-232 specifies the use of a DB25
connector, with, you guessed it, 25 pins. "Good god, 25 pins for a simple
serial connection?" you say. That's right, 25 pins. It is precisely because of
that bourgeois excess of pins that personal computer manufacturers, as an
industry, decided to trash the standard and use the smaller DE9 connector
instead.</p>
<p>In order to understand RS-232 and it's amusingly large connector specification
better, we need to understand a bit about the history of the standard.
Fortunately, that will also help a bit in understanding the baffling complexity
of actually making serial interfaces work today.</p>
<p>RS-232 was originally introduced to connect a terminal (originally a TTY) to a
modem. The specification was actually rather specific to that purpose, which
shows when we look at all the bonus pins. More generically, RS-232 is designed
to connect "data terminal equipment" (DTE) to "data communications equipment"
(DCE). As you often run into with these sorts of cabling, the TX pin of one
computer needs to connect to the RX pin of the other, and vice versa. For this
reason, the two devices on a serial connection should have their RX and TX pins
reversed compared to each other. </p>
<p>The terms DTE and DCE are usually used to identify these two different
configurations. That said, it was sometimes necessary to, for example, connect
two computers to each other, when both used the same interface. Further, some
manufacturers made (and continue to make) inconsistent decisions about whether
the computer or peripheral should be DCE or DTE. This necessitates using a
"null modem" cable, which is the equivalent of "crossover" for Ethernet before
GbE specified a far more flexible MDI.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out whether you should use a null modem or straight through
cable, which is usually easiest to do by experimentation, is just the first of
the many fun steps in successfully using a serial device.</p>
<p>Conceptually, RS-232 functions in an extremely simple way. To transmit a one,
you put a high (positive) voltage on the TX pin. To transmit a zero, you put a
low (negative) voltage on the TX pin. This is in reference to a ground pin,
which is usually connected right to local ground.</p>
<p>This gets us to our second bit of serial complexity, after figuring out whether
or not we need to add an extra swap in the RX and TX wires: clock recovery. In
most cases (we'll get to the exceptions later maybe), there is no explicit
clock information provided by a serial connection. Instead, the receiving
device must heuristically recover the clock rate. Some serial devices work this
out by expecting the transmitter to always send a certain preamble (common in
some industrial control and other situations), but the problem is solved more
generally by the convention of sending a "start bit" and "stop bit" of one and
zero successively, before and after each byte. This ensures at least one
transition and helps with detecting the timing of the whole byte.</p>
<p>Most devices expect one and one bit. Some devices expect two of each. Some
devices expect none at all (although they then usually use a protocol that
expects a preamble).</p>
<p>From this mess, you might think that the RS-232 standard does not specify any
method of clock synchronization. In fact, it does. It's just not implemented
on PC serial interfaces.</p>
<p>So I said 25 pins. Now we know what our first five are: we have ground, tx,
rx, and two pins that are used for synchronization, one in each direction.
That's 5. What about the other twenty?</p>
<p>Well, some are just for stuff that no one uses any more. There's a pin to
select the data rate (rarely used and unimplemented on PCs). There's a pin for
a transceiver self-test feature (rarely used and unimplemented on PCs). But
most of all, there is telephone modem arcana.</p>
<p>Remember, RS-232 was designed fairly specifically for a terminal to communicate
with its modem. Modems at the time had some fairly peculiar requirements and
restrictions. An obvious one is that the modem needs to signal the terminal
when it is ringing (in the sense of a phone), and there's a pin for that.
There's also a pin to indicate that the DCE has established a connection with
a remote DCE. There are two pins that the DTE can use to essentially conduct
a handshake with the DCE in preparation for sending data, a requirement due to
the half-duplex nature of modems. There are two pins for similar, but different
readiness negotiation in the other direction.</p>
<p>Most entertaining of all, there is <em>an entire second serial connection.</em> That's
right, the RS-232 standard specifies pins on the cable for a complete second
data path with its own data pins and control pins.</p>
<p>Add all this up and you get somewhere near 25, but not quite, because there are
a few unused.</p>
<p>When early PC manufacturers (but mostly IBM) were hunting around for a fairly
general-purpose interface to connect peripherals, RS-232 looked like a pretty
good solution because it was fairly simple to implement and provided a good
data rate. The problem is that it was over complicated. So, they just took the
parts they didn't like and threw them in the trash. The result is "RS-232
lite," a loosely specified standard that carried RS-232-esque signaling over a
smaller DE9 connector.</p>
<p>Here are the pins of the DE9 connector:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data carrier detect (DCD)</li>
<li>Rx</li>
<li>Tx</li>
<li>Data terminal ready (DTR)</li>
<li>Ground</li>
<li>Data set ready (DSR)</li>
<li>Request to send (RTS)</li>
<li>Clear to send (CTS)</li>
<li>Ring indicator</li>
</ol>
<p>This has the ground and two signal pins that we know we need, and then many,
but not all, of the control pins specified by RS-232. Notably, no clock pins,
meaning that properly synchronous serial standards (like several early computer
network standards) cannot be carried on these RS-232 interfaces. Don't worry,
this didn't stop anyone from trying to do general-purpose networking with these
things.</p>
<p>Quick sidebar: I said positive and negative voltage earlier. The RS-232
standard is really unspecific about these and in newer revisions they can range
from 3 to 25 volts, either positive or negative. As a de facto norm, most
computer "RS-232-ish" interfaces use 13 volts, but there are exceptions. The
standard requires that all interfaces tolerate up to the full 25 volts, but
I would not trust this too far.</p>
<p>So what about all the control pins that PC serial interfaces retain... well,
this gets us into the world of flow control. Often, when communicating with a
peripheral or another computer, it is necessary to somehow signal when you are
capable of receiving data (e.g. room in buffer). This is conventionally done on
serial ports by using the RTS and CTS pins to indicate readiness to receive
data by the DTE and DCE respectively, which is consistent with which ends of
the connection "own" those pins in the proper RS-232 specification. This is all
fine and good.</p>
<p>Except for it's not, because there are a number of serial devices out there
which do not implement the RTS/CTS pins for whatever reason (mostly money
reasons, I assume). So, a second convention …</p></article></div>

  <p>I love working with the command line. Seriously, I think there’s hardly any more productive and more versatile tool for a software developer than the terminal. Maybe it’s the hacker/wizard/neckbeard kind of feeling I get when using a terminal, I don’t know.</p>

<p>At work we do <em>lots</em> of pair programming. Everyone’s got their own laptop and can set it up the way they like. And since I love working with the command line I’ve spent quite some time doing (only sane! I swear!) modifications to my terminal environment that make working with the command line more pleasant and streamlined. This is why my pair usually will be greeted by something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hamvocke.com/assets/img/uploads/tmux.png" alt="tmux in action"></p>

<p>If they’ve worked with me before they know what they are up to. But every once in a while there will be a new team member who doesn’t know my environment. Usually this is the point where they will ask something like “WTF am I looking at?” and it’s my time to shine!</p>

<p>Because what they’re looking at is nothing less than the best thing since sliced bread. It’s <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a>, a so-called <em>terminal multiplexer</em>. Simply speaking, tmux acts as a window manager within your terminal<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and allows you to create multiple windows and panes within a single terminal window.</p>

<p>I’ll proceed to give them a two minute tour about what you can do with tmux. After that they’re either hooked and want to try it themselves or they tell me to go away with my ancient neckbeard tools and just use iTerm2. In the former case I’ll usually end up helping them installing tmux on their machine and will give them a 10 minute guide to learn the most important basics.</p>

<p>This post will give you the same two minute introduction about tmux and its possibilities, followed by the typical 10 minute hands-on guide to set up and get to know tmux yourself. If you’ve got 10 minutes to spare and finally want to be more proficient with tmux: read on!</p>

<h2 id="whats-tmux">What’s tmux?</h2>
<p>tmux’s authors describe it as a <em>terminal multiplexer</em>. Behind this fancy term hides a simple concept: Within one terminal window you can open multiple windows and split-views (called <em>“panes”</em> in tmux lingo). Each pane will contain its own, independently running terminal instance. This allows you to have multiple terminal commands and applications running visually next to each other without the need to open multiple terminal emulator windows.</p>

<p>On top of that tmux keeps these windows and panes in a session. You can exit a session at any point. This is called <em>“detaching”</em>. tmux will keep this session alive until you kill the tmux server (e.g. when you reboot)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is incredibly useful because at any later point in time you can pick that session up exactly from where you left it by simply <em>“attaching”</em> to that session.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with remote servers or a Raspberry Pi over ssh you can guess where this will be useful: When you lose your ssh connection the tmux session will simply be detached but will keep running on the server in the background including all the processes that run within your session. To continue your session simply ssh to the server again and attach to the running session.</p>

<p>But tmux is not only helpful when working on a remote machine. Not only for its window management features but also for the session handling. Personally I find myself detaching from sessions when I’m switching context. I’ll just start a new session for my new task and attach to the old session whenever I want to continue with my old task.</p>

<p>You see that tmux basically offers two big features: Window management in your terminal and session management. If you are familiar with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen">GNU Screen</a> this is nothing new. Think of tmux as an easier-to-use and a little more powerful alternative to Screen (obviously I’m being opinionated here).</p>

<p>Enough with the talking already. Let’s get our hands ready in the hands-on guide!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>This hands-on guide will get you up and running with tmux pretty quickly. It will only cover the basic features which should be more than enough to get started and be productive with tmux. Simply open your terminal and follow the instructions.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Fortunately installing tmux is pretty straightforward on most distributions a simple <code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code> (Ubuntu and derivatives) or <code>brew install tmux</code> (Mac) should be sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="starting-your-first-session">Starting Your First Session</h3>
<p>For your first session simply start tmux with a new session:</p>



<p>This will create a new tmux session with a nice all-green status bar at the bottom:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hamvocke.com/assets/img/uploads/tmux_blank.png" alt="vanilla tmux on startup"></p>

<p>The status bar is an important part of tmux. Apart from the currently opened windows (on the left) it also shows some system information like date and time (on the right). The status bar can also be customized and I’ve seen some really fancy stuff around (upcoming calendar events, battery status, to name a few) but this is something we’ll leave for later.</p>

<h3 id="splitting-panes">Splitting Panes</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve created our first session we can get a feeling for panes. When you create a new session, tmux will by default start with one window and a single panel inside. We want a nice split-screen, so let’s split this bad boy.</p>

<p>All commands in tmux are triggered by a <strong>prefix key</strong> followed by a <strong>command key</strong> (quite similar to emacs). By default, tmux uses <code>C-b</code> as prefix key. This notation might read a little weird if you’re not used to it. In this emacs notation <code>C-</code> means “press and hold the <code>Ctrl</code> key”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Thus <code>C-b</code> simply means press the <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>b</code> keys at the same time.</p>

<p>The shortcut to split panes into a left and a right pane is <code>C-b %</code>. Remembering what I’ve just told you about tmux’s sequence of <strong>prefix</strong> and <strong>command key</strong> this means to split your single pane into a left and a right pane you press <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>b</code> at the same time, release both, and then type the <code>%</code> key. Voilà! You’ve just invoked your first tmux command and split your pane in two.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hamvocke.com/assets/img/uploads/tmux_split.png" alt="tmux with two split panes"></p>

<p>Where there’s a split into left and right, there’s also a split into top and bottom pane. To split a pane into top and bottom panes use the <code>C-b "</code> shortcut.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-panes">Navigating Panes</h3>
<p>Right now we’re trapped in the newly created pane. But we really really want to go back to the left one. Easy peasy: Switching to a different pane uses the <code>C-b &lt;arrow key&gt;</code> shortcut, where &lt;arrow key&gt; is the arrow key pointing to the pane you want to switch to. In our case we want to switch to the panel on the left so it’s <code>C-b left</code> for us. Just once more, so that we fully understand this: This means you press <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>b</code> (your prefix) followed by the <code>left</code> arrow key to get to the pane on the left.</p>

<p>You can now go ahead and split each of your new panels even further. Feel free to experiment and split your panes like a maniac to get a feeling for it.</p>

<h3 id="closing-panes">Closing Panes</h3>
<p>Closing a pane is as simple as closing a regular terminal session. Either type <code>exit</code> or hit <code>Ctrl-d</code> and it’s gone.</p>

<h3 id="creating-windows">Creating Windows</h3>
<p>Windows in tmux can be compared to creating new virtual desktops; if you’ve ever worked with one of the major Linux deskop environments (KDE, Gnome) you’ll hopefully find this analogy helpful.</p>

<p>Creating new windows is as easy as typing <code>C-b c</code> (one last time: that’s <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>b</code> at once, then <code>c</code>). The new window will then be presented to you in tmux’s status bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hamvocke.com/assets/img/uploads/tmux_window.png" alt="tmux with two windows"></p>

<p>You can now divide the pane in your new window as you like. Or don’t. That’s up to you.</p>

<p>To switch to the <em>previous</em> window (according to the order in your status bar) use <code>C-b p</code>, to switch to the <em>next</em> window use <code>C-b n</code>. If you’ve created many windows you might find it useful to go to a window directly by typing its number (the status bar will tell you which window has which number), just use <code>C-b &lt;number&gt;</code> where &lt;number&gt; is the number in front of the window’s name in your status bar.</p>

<h3 id="session-handling">Session Handling</h3>
<p>If you’re done with your session you can either get rid of it by simply exiting all the panes inside or you can keep the session in the background for later reuse.</p>

<p>To detach your current session use <code>C-b d</code>. You can also use <code>C-b D</code> to have tmux give you a choice which of your sessions you want to detach. This will detach your session but will leave you’re doing in that session running in the background.</p>

<p>Now that your session is detached you can pick it up from where you left it at any later point in time. To re-attach to a session you need to figure out which session you want to attach to first. Figure out which sessions are running by using</p>



<p>This will give you a list of all running sessions, which in our example should be something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0: 2 windows (created Sat Aug 15 17:55:34 2015) [199x44] (detached)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To connect to that session you start tmux again but this time tell it which session to attach to:</p>



<p>Note that the <code>-t 0</code> is the parameter that tells tmux which session to attach to. “0” is the first part of your <code>tmux ls</code> output.</p>

<p>If you prefer to give your sessions a more meaningful name (instead of a numerical one starting with 0) you can create your next session using</p>



<p>This will create a new session with the name “database”.</p>

<p>You could also rename your existing session:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tmux rename-session -t 0 database
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next time you attach to that session you simply use <code>tmux attach -t database</code>. If you’re using multiple sessions at once this can become an essential feature.</p>

<p>And that’s it! Congratulations, you’ve just completed your first tmux session and got your hands dirty with its window and session management. Yes, there’s more stuff tmux can do. But what you’ve just learned should be everything to start using tmux in the future.</p>

<h2 id="why-tmux">Why tmux?</h2>
<p>A response that I get quite often is: “Great, I get it. But why should I use tmux and its weird key combinations instead of just using iTerm2?”</p>

<p>And you’re right, when it’s only basic window management, <a href="http://iterm2.com/">iTerm</a> for Mac supports tabs and panes as well. For Linux there’s <a href="http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html">Terminator</a>. So why would anyone feel the urge to learn some archaic technology in this day and age?</p>

<p>But you’re missing out. There are a couple of reasons why I favor tmux over iTerm et al.:</p>

<ul>
  <li>session handling: detaching from and attaching to sessions helps me with context switching and remote working</li>
  <li>platform independence: I can …</li></ul></div></div>

This is for users that are at least already familiar with the Blender UI as I will not be sharing details about scene setup, shortcuts or render settings.</p><p>My scene setup is fairly simple consisting of a few models, a plane with an added displacement/height map (terrain), a sun light and a spot light (for the antenna). As we can see from the screenshots below, the lightning looks very harsh because it illuminates the scene without any diffusion from small particles in the scene such as air/pollution. The scene looks rather plain and boring with no exciting photon action.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-1200x669.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="669" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-1200x669.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-744x415.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-420x234.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-768x428.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-560x312.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01-1536x857.jpg 1536w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/scene-setup-01.jpg 1581w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>Here is another look on the 3D environment. On the left side we can see the shader editor screen with the node configuration applied to the main plane to achieve the displaced terrain using a height map. All the view-port rendering is done in Cycles.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-1200x640.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="640" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-1200x640.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-744x397.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-420x224.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-768x409.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-560x298.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement-1536x819.jpg 1536w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/displacement.jpg 1576w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>Next, insert a plain cube into the scene and resize it to match the scene and visible area that will be rendered. We are going to make this cube look as it is made from fog. A foggy cube.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-1200x637.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="637" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-1200x637.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-744x395.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-420x223.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-768x407.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-560x297.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02-1536x815.jpg 1536w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/add-volume-shader-02.jpg 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>Once we are finished adjusting the cube size, go to the shader editor and apply a “Principled Volume” shader to the cube. Adjust the “Density” and “Emission Strength” values as well as corresponding colors to get the desired fog/atmosphere effect. You can also play with the strength of the sun light that’s illuminating the entire scene to see how it will interact with this newly added volume. You may want to adjust the Prinicpled Volume values depending on the sun strength.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-1200x628.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-1200x628.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-744x390.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-420x220.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-768x402.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-560x293.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03-1536x804.jpg 1536w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/set-shader-03.jpg 1579w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>Once we are done tweaking and adjusting the volume options and lightning position, we can set up the camera for that perfect angle and wait a couple of minutes for our render to finish. Although by using this method you will get way longer rendering times, the final result is much better and has a more natural look and feel. The light is soft and diffused thanks to the added volume, which makes the scene alive and more present.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1.jpg 1200w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-744x496.jpg 744w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-420x280.jpg 420w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-560x373.jpg 560w, https://petarpetkovski.net/wp-content/uploads/final-render-04-1-930x620.jpg 930w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p><p>That’s all for now, and I hope someone gets inspired by this :)</p><p>Read other stuff <a title="Blog" href="https://petarpetkovski.net/blog/">here</a>.</p></div></article></div></div></main></div></div>]]>
