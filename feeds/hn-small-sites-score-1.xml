<p><strong>Link</strong>: https://logolix.com/</p>



<p><strong>Founder</strong>: Joven Babovic</p>



<p><strong>Revenue</strong>: $4k MRR</p>



<p><strong>Product</strong>: “Free logo design for your projects.”</p>



<p><strong>Who is Joven Babovic and what business he started?</strong></p>



<p>Joven Babovic is a brand designer from Belgrade, Serbia. He is working on a productized logo design agency for tech founders, called Logolix, which starts three years ago.</p>



<p><strong>What is the backstory behind logolix and how he comes up with the idea?</strong></p>



<p>Back from 2012 to 2017, Joven is doing freelancing and participating in the design competition. But the competition on this platform is rapidly increasing, so he decided to start his agency. Logo design is a passion for Joven. But the problem is that compony only need new look ones every few years. That’s why he needs to find a new client after every work done. But he needs a steady stream of leads.</p>



<p>He analyzed the market and start plan what to do next and came up with an idea to give his some logo design for free. As he was designing the logo for three years and every client need 3-4 logos to choose the good one. However, after taking the best logos, the other logo is still unused, so he used that logos for people who were testing their ideas but don’t have money to spend on good looking logo’s. And give it free for them, hoping that they would come back and order a custom design later.</p>



<p>And this work for Joven is a stream of clients for three years without any additional marketing.</p>



<p><strong>How Joven came up with the prototype of his idea?</strong></p>



<p>Joven takes two weeks to create it’s the initial product.<br>He used a theme from ThemeForest as he is not a developer, but he has a good knowledge of customizing ThemeForest themes. Other then theme he purchased a domain and hosting which cost him around $100.</p>



<p>Here are the full steps involved in the two weeks of making initial product<br>1 Sort out best logos and package them for easy download.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>Write down landing page copy and created three different pricing packages</li><li>Customize the theme to match Logolix branding and add all of the logos</li><li>Create the design brief and integrate Typeform into the website.</li><li>Upload the website and make sure everything is functioning correctly (Google Analytics, Typeform, Download feature, Contact form, etc.)</li><li>Prepare the images and copy to launch on Product Hunt</li><li>Launch!</li></ol>



<p>He didn’t spend too much time on MVP and focused on the product’s back end and delivering exceptional service.</p>



<p><strong>Since launch what worked for Jovan to attract customers for logolix</strong>.</p>



<p>Joven knows the importance of freemium model people wanted to try something before they purchased it and that realize Joven that founders didn’t want to spend money on a new logo when just testing their ideas.</p>



<p>For getting customers, he researched where tech founders spend their time online, and that’s when he found product hunt. He saw many products are launching on product hunt, but the competition for logo design category didn’t have much competition.</p>



<p>And after a few days later Joven launched Logolix on Producthunt<br>And go to sleep after wake up he saw 11 new inquiries and Logolix got #1 product of the day with 780 upvotes. Logolix got 12000 visits, but the traffic is slowly died off in the next month.</p>



<p>Other then that referral is the most significant source of new clients for logolix.</p>



<p>Logolix started as a side hustle, and Joven doesn’t have any plan to scale it as it only provides additional income and allow him to work on projects that he likes to enjoy.</p>



<p><strong>Joven future plans with logolix</strong></p>



<p>Joven wants to write a guest post for getting extra exposure for logolix.</p>



<p>Other than that Joven wants to start a unique productized service soon.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what challenges Joven faced. And how he overcome those.</strong></p>



<p>The first mistake Joven did is that he get too excited after launch and after checking 12 orders, as he gets one to three clients per month, after seeing 12 orders at once, he gets a burden. He cancelled some order and worked with good earning potential orders if he takes all order and finds a good designer of its level to scale logolix to a different story.</p>



<p>The second mistake was to redesigning logolix landing page several time, which got him to bounce rate.<br>Here Is the lesson: don’t make massive changes if something is already working, just because you think it will work even better. Follow the data and try to improve your product step-by-step slowly.</p>



<p><strong>Through starting Logolix what Joven learn which is particularly helpful or advantages for him?</strong></p>



<p>I can’t pinpoint specific advice that helped me, but immersing myself in digital marketing content and the SaaS world gave me many insights. I wouldn’t have even thought of promoting my logos by giving them away for free if there wasn’t a SaaS article about freemiums.</p>



<p><strong>Advice from Joven for future entrepreneurs who were starting?</strong></p>



<p>Just start something. You don’t learn until you launch and nothing will be as you planned. You might fail bad, but take it as a lesson. You might also succeed beyond your wildest predictions.<br>Everything is about the mindset, and this cannot be overstated. I used to be a wantrepreneur and never thought that I could somehow scale my skills beyond selling $200 logos. Start believing in yourself and follow what people on the next level are doing. Don’t copy, but emulate.</p>



<p>One more piece of advice for anyone in the creative profession is to read Steven Pressfield’s work. I used to continually battle with procrastination until his books showed me a way out. If you struggle to start a new project or wait until the deadline to complete a task, resistance beats you. You have to learn how to overcome it if you want to achieve something great. Anyways, he’ll explain it much better than me.</p>

      <p><a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>
      
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy,
      not performance, usability, or anything else. </p><p>

    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to

                                <p><strong>What does the trait bound <code>'static</code> mean in Rust?</strong></p>
<p>After a few weeks of programming in Rust we should have a pretty good idea of what a <code>'static</code> reference is, but a <code>'static</code> trait bound can seem a bit more mysterious.</p>
<p>The first time I had to add a <code>'static</code> trait bound to my code. I didn't feel like I understood what was happening, because there were no references involved. In fact, the only data involved were function arguments being passed by ownership, which is usually a pretty reliable way of avoiding borrow checker problems.</p>
<p>In many cases, the rust compiler will suggest a <code>'static</code> trait bound to address a problem. The compiler is probably right, but let's explore what it really means so we can be confident that we understand the solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://codeandbitters.com/images/rust_logo_hand_drawn_1b.png" alt="Rust Logo" width="320" height="256"></p>
<h4 id="part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it">Part 1: We introduce a bug and the compiler helps us fix it.<a href="#part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-1-we-introduce-a-bug-and-the-compiler-helps-us-fix-it">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Let's use this code as our example:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: File) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That function works fine. However, I would like to be able to test the code but don't want my tests to actually create real files. Tests sometimes crash, after all, and it's a pain to ensure that tests always clean up after themselves. It's also no fun to debug unreliable test automation because the box ran out of scratch space due to tests leaking temporary files.</p>
<p>Instead, let's make <code>read_in_background</code> generic across a broader set of types:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This change makes the compiler sad, though:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0277]: `T` cannot be sent between threads safely
   --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
    |
6   |       thread::spawn(move || {
    |  _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^_-
    | |     |
    | |     `T` cannot be sent between threads safely
7   | |         let mut buf = Vec::&lt;u8&gt;::new();
8   | |         if let Ok(count) = f.read_to_end(&amp;mut buf) {
9   | |             println!("read {} bytes from file.", count);
10  | |         }
11  | |     });
    | |_____- within this `[closure@src/lib.rs:6:19: 11:6]`
</span></code></pre>
<p>The Rust compiler has a suggestion to improve our function: because we're calling <code>thread::spawn</code>, it would like our data to be safe to send between threads.</p>
<pre><code><span>help: consider further restricting this bound
    |
5   | pub fn read_in_background&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(mut f: T) {
</span></code></pre>
<p>That suggestion seems sensible. Let's do what it says; we'll add a <code>Send</code> bound to our generic type.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The compiler is still unsatisfied, though:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0310]: the parameter type `T` may not live long enough
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
  |
5 | pub fn read_in_background&lt;T: Read + Send&gt;(mut f: T) {
  |                           -- help: consider adding an explicit lifetime bound...: `T: 'static +`
6 |     thread::spawn(move || {
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ...so that the type `[closure@src/lib.rs:6:19: 11:6]` will meet its required lifetime bounds
</span></code></pre>
<p>The compiler is unhappy about lifetimes, and suggests we add a trait bound <code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler's <code>help</code> message has suggested the right thing (though it's not yet clear how or why). First, let's do what it says, just to see that it does work:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>&lt;T: Read + Send + </span><span>'static</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>mut </span><span>f</span><span>: T) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And the compiler is happy! I can write tests that use <code>std::io::Cursor</code> instead of <code>File</code>, and now my tests don't need to write things to the filesystem.</p>
<h4 id="part-2-what-just-happened-anyway">Part 2: What just happened, anyway?<a href="#part-2-what-just-happened-anyway" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-2-what-just-happened-anyway">🔗</a></h4>
<p>That <code>'static</code> nags at me. I passed the <code>T</code> (<code>File</code> or <code>Cursor</code> or whatever) by transferring ownership. There were no references in use, so why is a lifetime bound needed?</p>
<p>The answer is that when we create a generic type <code>T</code>, we need to convince the compiler that our function must work for all possible types (that satisfy the bounds <code>Read + Send</code>). Some of those types <strong>might be references!</strong> Or might include references internally.</p>
<p>Let's build an alternate universe version of our function, before we made it generic:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> File) {
    thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
        </span><span>let mut</span><span> buf = Vec::&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;::new();
        </span><span>if let </span><span>Ok(count) = f.</span><span>read_to_end</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> buf) {
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from file.</span><span>", count);
        }
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The only thing I changed is that the argument is now type <code>&amp;mut File</code> instead of <code>File</code>, so we're passing in a reference with an un-specified lifetime.</p>
<p>The compiler dislikes this, and expresses itself with a familiar message:</p>
<pre><code><span>error[E0621]: explicit lifetime required in the type of `f`
 --&gt; src/lib.rs:6:5
  |
5 | pub fn read_in_background(f: &amp;mut File) {
  |                              --------- help: add explicit lifetime `'static` to the type of `f`: `&amp;'static mut std::fs::File`
6 |     thread::spawn(move || {
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ lifetime `'static` required
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code could have worked, except that anything sent through the wormhole into <code>thread::spawn</code> may need to live for an arbitrary amount of time. The only solution available to us is to tag that reference with <code>'static</code> to ensure we don't violate memory safety rules. (Alternatively, we could go looking for a <a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.8.0/crossbeam/thread/index.html">scoped thread implementation</a>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an interesting fact: the <code>Read</code> trait is implemented for <code>&amp;File</code>! Had the compiler not forced us to add a <code>'static</code> bound, our generic implementation with <code>T: Read + Send</code> could accept <code>&amp;File</code> without being able to prove a correct lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way that I often think about the <code>'static</code> trait bound is:</p>
<p><em><strong>"I don't want my generic type <code>T</code> to permit reference types."</strong></em></p>
<p>That's not strictly true, because we know it will allow references that can live forever. But for the sake of simplicity, when I want to pass ownership of a real value, I don't want to think about the compiler allowing references under certain peculiar conditions. Instead I am going to use a lazy mental shortcut, and allow myself to believe that <code>'static</code> means "don't allow references".</p>
<p>There's another possible case, which is a type that has internal references. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyCursor&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>data</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>],
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; Read </span><span>for </span><span>MyCursor&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>buf</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; std::result::Result&lt;</span><span>usize</span><span>, std::io::Error&gt; {
        </span><span>let</span><span> size = </span><span>min</span><span>(buf.</span><span>len</span><span>(), </span><span>self</span><span>.data.</span><span>len</span><span>());
        buf[..size].</span><span>copy_from_slice</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.data[..size]);
        Ok(size)
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is perhaps a bit silly, because <code>std::io::Cursor&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;</code> already exists. But it illustrates the point: even if we try to pass ownership of <code>MyCursor</code> to our generic <code>read_in_background</code>, the compiler should prevent us.</p>
<p>This provides a slightly less lazy way of thinking about the <code>T: 'static</code> trait bound: imagine that any potential <code>T</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Thing&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; {
    ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We are using the bound <code>T: 'static</code> to restrict <code>Thing&lt;'a&gt;</code> to <code>Thing&lt;'static&gt;</code>. If the type doesn't have any generic lifetime parameters, then that bound is automatically satisfied. It's as though every data structure without a generic lifetime parameter has an implicit <code>&lt;'static&gt;</code> attached.</p>
<h4 id="part-3-doing-the-same-thing-with-a-custom-trait">Part 3: Doing the same thing, with a custom trait.<a href="#part-3-doing-the-same-thing-with-a-custom-trait" aria-label="Anchor link for: part-3-doing-the-same-thing-with-a-custom-trait">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The same basic principle applies if I want <code>read_in_background</code> to be part of a trait.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BgRead {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>);
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; BgRead </span><span>for </span><span>T
</span><span>where</span><span>
    T: Read + Send + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// ...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works fine. It's also possible to attach some or all of the trait bounds to the trait definition itself:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>BgRead: Send + 'static {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>);
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Why attach the trait bounds to the trait definition, if it's not necessary to make the code work? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe BgRead would never make sense for reference types, and we want to convey that expectation to humans reading the code.</li>
<li>The compiler will complain right away if we accidentally allow a reference type. This might save us a little time when adding new <code>impl</code>s, by making the mistake obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate this, imagine we decide to implement the <code>BgRead</code> trait for any type <code>Into&lt;String&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; BgRead </span><span>for </span><span>T
</span><span>where</span><span>
    T: Into&lt;String&gt;,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>read_in_background</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        thread::spawn(</span><span>move </span><span>|| {
            </span><span>let</span><span> s: String = </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>into</span><span>();
            println!("</span><span>read </span><span>{}</span><span> bytes from string.</span><span>", s.</span><span>len</span><span>());
        });
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We won't get very far with this code, because we try to send <code>self</code> to another thread (which will require <code>Send + 'static</code>), and the compiler will say so clearly. If our code were more complex, it might not be as obvious what's wrong— perhaps the value gets passed down through layers of generic functions before the error appears.</p>
<p>It might save some time if we communicate with future implementers of <code>BgRead</code> by putting those trait bounds on the trait itself. If they turn out to be wrong, it will probably be easy to loosen the bounds on the trait later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2089-implied-bounds.md">Rust RFC 2089, implied_bounds</a>, which would allow us to omit the trait bounds on an <code>impl</code> if they were already expressed in the trait itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this was helpful! Good luck with your Rust projects.</p>

            <p>
                Posted on <time datetime="2020-12-24 09:53:00">December 24, 2020</time>
            </p>
                        <p>According to conventional wisdom, if you earn 31€/hour, and a task costs less than that to outsource, then you should always pay someone else to do it. For example, if your cleaning person charges 15€/hour, you save 16€ for every hour you spend at work instead of cleaning your house.</p>
<p>I've encountered this advice quite often, particularly among the wealthier, productivity porn-loving, <em>4-Hour Work Week</em>-thumping entrepreneur crowd.<br></p>
<p>I don't think that advice is quite right.</p>
<h2>Your time is worth less than you think</h2>
<p>There is a hefty tax on converting time to money. In Germany, if you earned the average income (42 421€ per year)<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a></sup>, you'd lose roughly a quarter of it to income tax<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=einkommensteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup>. Your 31€/hour salary<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416207/average-annual-wages-germany-y-on-y-in-euros/">1</a>, <a href="https://clockify.me/working-hours">2</a></sup> is actually worth 24€/hour after taxes.</p>
<p>But there is more to account for: health insurance (7.3%), unemployment insurance (1.25%), public pension (9.3%) and nursing care insurance (1.775%)<sup><a href="http://www.parmentier.de/steuer/index.php?site=lohnsteuerrechnerjava">1</a></sup> are also deducted from your salary. When it's all said and done, you take home about 20€/hour. If you also pay church tax and get the most expensive health insurance, you keep 19€/hour.</p>
<p>So again, if you earn the average 31€/hour, and work the average 1386 hours per year, you save about 4€ per hour - not 16€ - by hiring a cleaning person who charges half your rate.</p>
<p>Taxes aren't the only thing that whittle away your disposable income. You also have some unavoidable expenses, namely rent, groceries and utilities. That's 550€, 150€ and 100€ per month for a single, thrifty Berliner. That's 35% of your take-home salary, so you're left with 12.50€/hour in disposable income. At this point, I'm including decimals, because they start to matter.</p>
<p>In other words, you must sell 72 minutes of your life to buy 60 minutes of your cleaning person's life, even though you earn twice as much.</p>
<p>Here's a recap for the mathematically inclined:</p>
<pre>hourly_disposable income = (
    (gross_income - income_tax)
    - health_insurance
    - unemployment_insurance
    - pension_insurance
    - nursing_care_insurance
    - (rent + groceries + utilities) * 12
) / hours_worked_per_year</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this describes the reality in Germany, where people work much less, but pay higher taxes. You will get wildly different results in your own country.</p>
<h2>Outsourcing costs more than you think</h2>
<p>Eating out is often used as an example of trading money for time. It's faster than cooking your own food: no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.<br></p>
<p>In Berlin, you can get a square meal for 10€. A croissant, a coffee and two square meals would set you back 20€ a day. By comparison, my grocery bill is 5€ a day. That's a 450€/month difference, or 37.5 hours of your time (see above), but you'd probably spend that much time between the supermarket and the kitchen anyway.<br></p>
<p>However, getting to&nbsp;the restaurant, ordering, waiting for your food, then waiting for the bill takes time too. Personally, I&nbsp;find cooking every other day more convenient  than eating out twice a day. Eating out only makes sense when I'm too tired to cook.<br></p>
<p>This also applies to hiring professionals. You still need time to find one and to work with their schedule. I can change the oil or the brakes on my motorcycle in about 30 minutes. It takes me about as long to drop my bike off at the dealership, but I&nbsp;have to do it during office hours, and wait a few days to get it back.<br></p>
<p>In short, outsourcing your work does not always make life easier. It can lighten your mental load, but so does working less by having lower expenses.<br> </p>
<h2>Time is not a liquid asset</h2>
<p>In practice, you don't get to choose how much of your time you sell.&nbsp;If your expenses are covered, you just can't stop going to work. If you need more money, you could work more, but rarely on your own terms, just when you need to. You couldn't sell an extra 2 hours of programming on a Thursday night, because you have nothing else going on.&nbsp; There's also a limit on how much time you can sustainably sell, regardless of demand - about 60 hours a week.<br></p>
<p>You can't choose which time you sell either. Most employers will only buy your office hours. You can't decide to work night shifts, or to work 80 hour weeks in the winter, then take the summer off. You can't even decide where to allocate the time you <em>didn't</em> sell. Your employer usually decides when you take your lunch breaks, and when you can use your holidays. If you're on call, even your free time isn't quite yours.</p>
<p>In other words, you don't really trade more time at the office for less time cleaning your house. You're stuck at the office for 40 hours a week regardless, so you're just using some of your fixed budget. However, if you <em>don't</em> hire a cleaning person, and you don't spend your money, then you can buy some&nbsp;of your time back later, either as a gap year, or as an early retirement.</p>
<p>As a freelancer, you have much more control over what time you sell, and in which amount. Nonetheless, you are still bound to standard contract lengths, to the limits of your body, and to cyclical demand in your industry. A freelance accountant likely won't take time off during tax season. A freelance developer will mostly find 3 to 6 month contracts.<br></p>
<p>Put shortly, time is not a liquid asset. You can't easily  sell more or less of it according to your needs.</p>
<h2>Time does not have a fixed value</h2>
<p>Let's pretend that your boss lets you work for as long as you need, whenever you need to. You could spend an extra hour at the office, and pay someone to save you an hour of cleaning.</p>
<p>I'd make that deal. Swearing at my computer brings me joy, but doing the dishes doesn't. I'd gladly trade a few hours of programming for a few hours of cleaning.</p>

<p>After 30 hours a week, I'd start to value my time at the office a bit more. I'd rather spend that time at home, sipping a beer on my balcony with a pie in the oven, so I&nbsp;wouldn't be so keen to sell it.</p>
<p>After 50 hours, I'd be selling my time at a much higher price. There's a point where work takes a toll on your body, and seeps into other aspects of your life.&nbsp;By then, menial work feels like a release, rather than a chore.</p>
<p>Unless you&nbsp;<em>really</em> like your job, there comes a point where you'd rather do something else, even if has a lower market value than your profession.<br></p>
<h2>The hidden benefits of doing it yourself</h2>
<p>The most understated benefit of doing things yourself is the skills and the tools you acquire along the way. Your cooking gets better and more diversified with every meal you cook. Bike repairs get cheaper and easier with every attempt. Those skills stay with you, and over time, the benefits compound. You can tackle bigger and bigger projects, and the results look better and better.</p>
<figure><img src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/_fullWidth2x/level-up.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>Outsourcing, on the other hand, doesn't get better and cheaper. It either gets better and more expensive, or cheaper and worse. This ties your quality of life to a single variable: your income. Your lifestyle is much more reliant on your ability to stay employed, because it's the only thing you can do.<br></p>
<p>Beyond that, doing things yourself is immensely rewarding. Wrenching on your own motorcycle feels good. Delighting your guests with a home-cooked meal feels good. Using shelves you built yourself feels good. These are direct products of your hard work, and symbols of the control you have over your environment.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that it gives you a greater appreciation for the world you live in. It allows you to see things beyond the surface. Musicians appreciate music on a different level,
 and the same can be said for gardeners, machinists, architects and 
every other kind of enthusiast. My fledgling interest in gardening quite literally made me see the forest for the trees.<br></p>
<p>Paying someone else to do it robs you of this joy. Climbing through the career ladder provides its own rewards, but those always felt too abstract to me. If I  indirectly make my company a little leaner, I&nbsp;get 4% more disposable income. Big whoop.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Some tasks don't develop useful skills. They don't get easier, cheaper or more enjoyable with time. Chores are chores, and some work is just plain tedious. No matter how good I&nbsp;get at painting walls, I still hate it with a passion.&nbsp;My father fixed cars his entire life, and he won't change his oil in the winter, when the car is caked in&nbsp;slush.</p>
<p>Life is short, and the 40 hour work week isn't going anywhere, so it's okay to spare your free time for things you enjoy. That's worth paying a premium for.</p>
<p>Even if you enjoy doing something, the timing isn't always right.&nbsp;I found that my motorcycle's front rim was bent just before leaving for a 3 month trip. I already had a lot on my plate with work and trip preparations, so I paid a mechanic to do it. Outsourcing lets you solve multiple problems in parallel.</p>
<p>In some cases, the upfront cost of doing things yourself is just too high. I won't resurface my motorcycle's cylinder head at home, because the tools cost more than my net worth, and highly trained machinists will do it for 100€.&nbsp;Sometimes, it's better to let economies of scale do their thing.</p>
<p>In other cases, the running costs are too high. All those things you maintain will chip away at your free time. In aggregate, they can swallow your evenings. For example, think twice about running your own server to save a few euros per month. These needy buggers tend to require your attention at the most inopportune times. Outsourcing means someone else is taking care of it, and invoicing you once a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the risk isn't worth the potential savings. It's important to learn how to do things yourself, but don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't cause hundreds of euros worth of damage to save a few euros. Hire a professional, and let them do their job.&nbsp;If they cock up, <em>they</em> are liable to fix the mess, not you.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, outsourcing has its time and place, but it's more expensive than it appears. Sometimes, it's better to do things yourself, and acquire useful skills …</p></article></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Improving Communication in Development Teams]]>

  <p>
    <span>December 7, 2020</span>
    <span>●</span>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    In software development, communicating productively is as important as
    writing quality code quickly. Maybe even more important - studies show that
    most problems in software projects are in fact communication problems.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="why-focus-on-communication">
    <a href="#why-focus-on-communication">Why focus on communication?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    On the Internet, you can find many articles and studies about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+software+projects+fail" target="_blank">
      why software projects fail
    </a>. They cite different reasons, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lack of understanding of business needs;</li>
    <li>Vague or poorly communicated requirements;</li>
    <li>Unrealistic timelines or expectations;</li>
    <li>False belief that scope can be defined upfront;</li>
    <li>Inadequate planning;</li>
    <li>Too many or too few people assigned to a project;</li>
    <li>Poor reporting of project status;</li>
    <li>Unmanaged risks;</li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you look closer, you'll notice that these reasons point to one thing in
    common: a disconnect between management and developers. So removing this
    disconnect should yield great returns.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">
    <a href="#does-it-mean-we-should-talk-more">Does it mean we should talk more?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What would improve communication between developers and management? This is
    a broad topic, but one idea's obvious: they must communicate frequently
    enough to be on the same page about goals, requirements, priorities, work
    progress, project challenges, and risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates another problem though: to be productive, developers need
    prolonged periods of quiet time. They need to do focused work, without
    distractions. Meetings distract developers from writing code. And waiting
    for the meeting can be even worse. If people know they'll be interrupted
    soon, they'll feel discouraged from starting anything big. Paul Graham
    wrote a great article about this -
    <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank">
      Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so on one hand we need to talk to developers, but on the other we
    shouldn't distract them so much that they can't be productive. Finding this
    delicate balance may be hard, but we can make the job easier by removing
    trivial questions from the discussion. Below I'll give some examples of how
    well organized processes and technology can help us talk less, but do more.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">
    <a href="#stop-asking-whos-working-on-what">Stop asking who's working on what</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    One such trivial question is “Who's working on what?” Isn't that what the
    task tracker's for? All task trackers incorporate concepts like Assignee
    and Status. When tasks are accurately assigned with up-to-date statuses,
    you'll have immediate visibility about who's working on what and how long
    they've been working on it. Besides that, you may occasionally need to
    return to old completed tasks. Having an accurate task history helps you
    return easily.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though task tracking sounds simple, in practice it requires a manager's
    effort to keep your task tracker in good shape. People may forget to switch
    task statuses, or assign tasks to themselves. Someone might not have a task
    in progress at all. Someone else might have multiple tasks in progress,
    which once again, doesn't tell us what exactly they're working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created these "In progress"
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/notification-types/">notifications</a>
    in Teamplify:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No issues in progress" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/no-issues-in-progress@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Teamplify connects to your task tracker, like Jira or Trello. If it's not
    clear what developers are working on, it will politely ask, in Slack or
    over email, to update their task status. These notifications are smart and
    unobtrusive. They also take all kinds of non-working days into
    consideration, so they won't disturb your teammates on their vacation.
    More on that later.
  </p>

  
  
  <h2 id="make-work-progress-visible">
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Make work progress visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Today, almost every development team uses at least some version of these
    collaboration tools:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>code hosting - for example, GitHub or GitLab;</li>
    <li>task tracker - Jira, Trello, or similar;</li>
    <li>chat - many teams use Slack;</li>
    <li>video conferencing software, such as Zoom.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tools are usually shared with the whole team, so any team member can
    take a look and learn something about work progress. Unfortunately,
    looking over each tool is not a convenient way to learn what the team has
    been busy on. Because the information is fragmented, not everyone will be
    willing to dig through it. It's much easier to ask about the status in a
    meeting.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we created the Team Calendar view, which collects all the work
    activity from your team tools and puts it in one place. It also shows
    national holidays, vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Team Calendar" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/team-calendar@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar displays the most important types of team work activity,
    including code commits, task updates, and communication over video and chat.
    It also automatically detects when someone mentions a task in chat messages
    and code commits. For example, if a task was discussed somewhere in Slack,
    you'll see it, and be able to click directly to that discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Better visibility into work progress means better informed managers, with
    less need for meetings and less developer distractions.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="make-time-off-visible">
    <a href="#make-time-off-visible">Make time-off visible</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Time off plays an important role in short-term project planning. Even in
    small organizations, people don't always remember who's going on vacation
    next week. And if your team is distributed, it's quite easy to forget about
    other country's national holidays.
  </p>

  <p>
    When someone's absence is a surprise, it's not good for your project.
    Making time-off clearly visible helps people better plan around it.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why we added time-off management to Teamplify. National holidays,
    vacations, sick days, and other
    <a href="https://teamplify.com/member-status/">member statuses</a> are visible on the
    <a href="#make-work-progress-visible">Team Calendar</a> mentioned above.
    You can also configure notifications for Slack or email:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Sick day notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-sick-day@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Even if people miss the notification and mention someone who is absent
    today, Teamplify will politely remind them:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Time off friendly reminder" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-friendly-reminder@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    You can also request a vacation or add another status via the Teamplify
    Slack bot, so you can manage off time without leaving Slack.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="identify-stuck-progress">
    <a href="#identify-stuck-progress">Identify stuck progress</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Even the best and brightest developers get stuck sometimes. There may be an
    unexpected technical problem, or maybe the task turns out to be more
    difficult than previously thought. In such cases, brainstorming with
    colleagues may help find a solution or an alternative path and boost the
    progress significantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we haven't seen any code activity from a developer in a while, it
    doesn't necessarily mean that they're stuck, but it might signal a good
    time to check if everything's alright.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="No recent commits notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-no-recent-commits@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    Stuck communication is just another form of stuck progress. This could be a
    lengthy discussion without any productive decision. More often, it's just a
    question that's been waiting too long for an answer:
  </p>

  <p>
    <img alt="Pending questions notification in Slack" src="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions.png?3468" srcset="https://cdn.teamplify.com/blog/img/slack-pending-questions@2x.png?3468 2x">
  </p>

  <p>
    If a bot can politely remind your correspondent about your pending
    question, it means you don't have to. Besides that, bot notifications are
    sometimes better perceived. If a person reminds you every day about pending
    questions, it might be annoying. But if a bot does the same - it's probably
    okay, because, you know, it's just a bot.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="bottom-line">
    <a href="#bottom-line">Bottom line</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    When communication improvements add up, the result is a more productive
    work environment, where people are better informed and spend less time on
    discussing trivial questions. We have a lot of complex problems to solve,
    let's focus on them instead.

Broadway shows look glamorous and expensive on the outside, but it’s often quite the opposite on the inside –&nbsp;at least for the music department. One of the toughest parts of my job as an electronic music designer was to find the best performance-to-cost ratio for computer rigs powering keyboards, guitars, playback tracks, and more.</p><p>Over the past decade, Broadway has replaced large sections of traditional orchestras with synthesizers, playback systems, and electronic drum pads. I’m not in support of that, but that’s a story for another day. The point here is that Broadway’s reliance on computer-driven rigs has increased, while the typical budget required to build high-end stable rigs hasn’t increased at the same rate.</p><p>Some shows I’ve worked at set aside a $10,000-$12,000 budget for two keyboard rigs. That sounds like a lot of money at first, but it’s not. For live shows, it’s usually best to have a 1:1 backup in case the main rig fails. That fact alone means you have to design a rig that fits within 50% of the proposed budget. Furthermore, a high-quality keyboard controller alone is $1,500-2,000 –&nbsp;so that means there’s $3,000 left for a computer and everything else.</p><p>Due to budget constraints, many shows end up using Mac minis. Historically speaking, the Mac mini’s computing power has been a bottleneck for electronic music designers on Broadway. In a perfect world, we’d all like to use the best-sounding sample libraries for our work, but that was never feasible with the Mac mini. Thus, the compromise was always to reduce sound quality to fit within the Mac mini’s compute constraints.</p><p>Apple Silicon changes everything for Broadway electronic music designers. The new M1 Mac mini is capable of running high-end sample libraries and virtual instruments in a stable manner, and it’s only going to get better with M2, M3, and M4-series chips in the future. The performance per dollar characteristics of Apple Silicon machines are going to have a huge impact on Broadway’s sound, and I’m very excited to see, or hear, what happens.</p></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

Of the popular social media platforms, Twitter stands out in its usefulness in different facets of higher education, including teaching, receiving the latest updates in a field of study, increasing academic citations, and sharing opinions on current events.</p><p>For China scholars in particular, Twitter offers the opportunity to communicate with a diverse spectrum of sources of specialist and generalist knowledge of China, including certain intellectuals and activists based in mainland China (who override the censorship placed on Twitter), besides Chinese media like Xinhua and People’s Daily and Western media covering China issues. Academic journals like The China Quarterly, as well as relevant academic departments and institutes, also have a presence on Twitter. Moreover, upwards of 300 China studies scholars, spanning all fields and career stages, are active on Twitter (Sullivan, 2016).</p><p>In an interesting <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/china-scholars-and-twitter/0B265DA8C8E2C7581A5179F43B973379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a>, Jonathan Sullivan of the University of Nottingham systematically examined how China scholars are adopting Twitter for a number of professional reasons like networking with other researchers in their field of work, increasing research visibility, staying up-to-date on developments in their study domain, and building an online presence for themselves. He uncovered some valuable takeaways in the process, which will be discussed in this article.</p></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>China scholars’ use and views of Twitter</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>In his study, Sullivan surveyed the experiences and perceptions of a fraction of China scholars who use Twitter. Half of the respondents of the survey reported using Twitter for more than two years, and 15% had less than a year’s experience. <strong>Nearly 44% reported using Twitter for up to an hour every day</strong>. Most of the scholars stated that they use Twitter to collect information and stay abreast of current events. About 75% scholars said they share links and related materials, publicize their own activities, and connect with other China scholars. Two-thirds revealed they use Twitter to connect with China-focused professionals in other sectors. Over half the respondents stated that Twitter had helped them become much better informed. While 42% of the surveyed scholars felt that Twitter had helped them expand their academic and professional networks considerably, 40% thought it had not added value to their academic reputations at all.</p><p>Several respondents agreed that Twitter widened information access and exposed them to new ideas and teaching materials. Positive effects reported by some scholars included achieving a wider network than would be possible in the physical world, the conception of novel ideas for research, and staying up to date with the latest developments in their field. A few negative points noted by the respondents about Twitter use were distraction, reduced productivity, and information overload.</p><p>The conflict between the “rapid-response Twitter commentary” versus the traditionally slow pace of scholarly practice was also voiced by certain respondents. Some scholars stated that their peers perceived Twitter as a waste of time or a platform for blatant self-promotion. Many respondents expressed apprehensions and reluctance to openly discuss sensitive issues about China because of possible repercussions on their access to the country or collaborators residing therein.</p></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>Why should Early Career Researchers (ECRs) use Twitter in 2020?</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>Twitter offers real-time interaction, a sense of closeness, and short response times. In addition, discoverability, enabled by the use of hashtags, makes it easy to rapidly find and share content and increase visibility. The informal nature of communication helps soften communication barriers with senior researchers, whom junior scholars might otherwise be hesitant to reach out to in person. Another key feature of Twitter is the use of multiple captivating content formats like infographics and videos, which attract interest and hold public attention, as well as interactive features like polls, which engage audiences actively.</p><p>Promoting one’s research on Twitter <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been</a> found to positively correlate with higher citation counts. According to one study, articles tweeted about received thrice as many citations as those that were not tweeted about. In his article, Sullivan cites several studies highlighting Twitter as an alternative measure of research impact and professional competence. Metrics based on social media forums like Twitter provide new ways to evaluate the significance and reach of a research output, complementing traditional citation metrics. Quantifying activity such as retweets and mentions of scholarly articles might help build a more complete picture of a researcher’s work and social influence.</p></div></div><div><p>Twitter also makes it easy to have intra-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary exchanges with scholars. In addition, Twitter is being used to comment upon academic practices and culture, seek and share advice, deliberate on teaching practices, and discuss and debate issues in real time. <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/07/26/a-to-z-of-social-media-for-academia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some</a> scholars go as far as saying that opting out of social media can be equated with opting out of email in the 1990s.</p></div><div><p><h4><strong>How can China scholars benefit from Twitter?</strong></h4></p></div><div><p>Some tips to engage productively on Twitter include sharing interesting articles and book reviews related to topical issues and participating in Twitter discussions with relevant hashtags, e.g., #PhDChat or #AcademicTwitter. Using and following hashtags like #ChinaStudies and #ChinaScholars would be a useful way to identify other researchers from the field and forge academically meaningful connections. China scholars may have expertise in niche areas, and by creating and promoting their distinct profiles (“branding,” so to speak), they can harness Twitter’s potential for boosting visibility and recognition.</p></div><div><div><blockquote><p><strong>The Story of Tricia Kehoe</strong></p><p><em>An interesting story that reinforces the importance of China scholars to utilize Twitter is that of Tricia Kehoe, Sullivan’s student, whose area of interest is Tibetan studies. Kehoe chanced upon a second-hand copy of an obscure book, titled Sue in Tibet. Intrigued by what appeared to be the first piece of Western children’s literature set in Tibet, she posted a picture of the book on Twitter. Almost instantly, she was contacted by Samanthi Dissanayake, the Asia editor for the BBC News website, regarding the possibility of an article based on the book. Thus began Kehoe’s quest into the life and background of the book’s author, Dorris Shelton Still, with Twitter playing a huge role in locating Dorris’s family and gleaning insights into her life and experiences in Tibet. The accidental discovery of an American woman’s perspectives of life in Tibet in the early 1900s and the wise decision of sharing it on Twitter sparked interest in the right places. Kehoe ended up being interviewed on BBC’s Newshour, and the story also featured in a series by The New York Times, thanks to the “<span><a href="https://jonlsullivan.com/tag/china-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the engine of creativity that is Twitter</a></span>,” tweeted Dissanayake. This media exposure was a bonus for Kehoe, who unwittingly displayed her ability to engage audiences beyond her field of study, all the way to the general public.</em></p><p><em>Tweeting is an excellent way to demonstrate engagement with current affairs and reach out to journalists for promotion and garnering public attention. Sometimes, as in Kehoe’s case, journalists may contact a researcher upon spotting a social media post with potential for an interesting story. In fact, Sullivan notes that by trawling Twitter, China correspondents often identify scholars to interview. Media pieces resulting from these interactions can help establish useful connections and build professional reputation. Journalists even <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24742163?seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>advise</span></a> China scholars to use Twitter in order to increase their online presence and media impact. Like the rediscovery of Sue in Tibet, many more stories remain to be unraveled, shared, and discussed widely.</em></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p><h4><strong>Constraints faced by China Scholars</strong></h4></p></div><div><div><p>Some scholars felt that their superiors did not consider Twitter use favorable in the study environment.</p><p>While many China scholars would be interested to take part in open discussions related to their field of study, most express inhibitions to do so. Access to domestic social media platforms such as Sina Weibo is an option for scholars residing in China, these sites are heavily monitored, preventing unrestricted and uncensored exchange of information.</p><p>Another constraint faced by Twitter users in general is the 280-character limit for a tweet. This forces scholars to distil their findings into a pithy and more accessible format. Therefore, expressing results as concisely as possible is a skill that early career scholars need to fine-tune.</p><p>Using social media as an academic increases opportunities for collaboration and engagement, and several Western universities now place considerable emphasis on impact and engagement in higher education. However, ECRs are not typically trained to build this ability. Thus, experience and skill in optimizing Twitter use are focus areas for young scholars.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Besides research, teaching, and administration, competence in handling digital media is increasingly being encouraged by institutions. Twitter has been found to benefit China scholars hoping to expand their external engagement profile, particularly by opening possibilities for media engagement.</p><p>China scholars who are social media savvy will be at an advantage in the competitive job market. In fact, as demonstrated by the story of Tricia Kehoe, China scholars can benefit tremendously from such active and sustained networking with various stakeholders.</p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p><em>In 2020, researchers are now …</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div>

      Got some hilarious reactions. Gotta share.
    </p><div>

<p>Well, <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/bugreport-free-support">my last post hit it big</a>. Poor blog had a couple social media death hugs on that day. Gosh, people were fuming about me (supposedly) stating that I would not accept their hand-laced, gold-edged, rose scented bug reports without prior payment. How dare I?! Well, I simply do. </p><figure>

<p>The statement was actually that I ignore support requests from non-customers, <strong>especially</strong> when they come <u>disguised</u> as bugreports in order to avoid my fee. I don’t deliberately delete bug reports from my inbox, I simply risk loosing genuine ones because they are drowned out.</p>

<p>But hey, social media. Fast paced universe. Gotta comment while it’s hot, no time to (properly) read the original article. Some people hold some hilarious opinions, though!</p>

<h2 id="what-people-wrote">What people wrote</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs must be fixed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don’t. Have you read the license agreement? Search for the phrase “AS IS”. Every <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved license</a> contains it (usually in caps). It means, I am under no obligation to provide any further work and you are not entitled to it.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a simple way to make me owe you a service (and I’m even offering it): put money in my bank account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was your fault in the first place!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Oh wait. Is this going to be one of those conspiracy theories where I deliberately put bugs into my code in order to make you pay for removing them? Nice idea, but…</p>

<ul>
<li>That plan does not scale. There are only so many bugs I could plant.</li>
<li>Fixing bugs is the most time consuming form of support. I’m making a loss on that (in particular when considering the time required to design a good bug that some<u>one</u> might pay for getting removed).</li>
<li>I gave you the source, that takes the leverage out of my hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice to use my software was yours. The disclaimer that it might not work is in the license agreement. I did not put myself in the position of being your only option to solve the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My bug reports are a work of art, you prick! I spent MY TIME on helping YOU to improve YOUR software!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your bug doesn’t bother me. If it did, I’d have fixed it myself. When submitting a bug report, you are not working for me, you are working for yourself and the user community. The same way I was, when making the original software available free of charge (whether or not you want to do it is entirely your choice, I’m not asking you to). Does your bug report include a patch? If yes, then the problem’s solved for you, if not, then you are expecting me to come up with a fix. That’s a work order, here’s my bill.</p>

<p>Why? If I look at the mail, I’ll be tempted to act on it, giving someone a free ride. That’s unfair to those who paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I’ll have to pay and get no guarantee that my bug will be fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but you are guaranteed, that I will be listening to you and give you a definitive answer in a timely manner. That’s something you don’t get from public bugtrackers. See the problem here? You base your risk assessment on your experience with developers you don’t pay and who therefore have no incentive to help you. When I take your money, you are a customer.</p>

<p>I don’t care.</p>

<ul>
<li>If some other developer wants to self exploit and thinks his time is only worth cheers, that’s their choice.</li>
<li>If the project(s) you are talking about are mission critical (and are otherwise funded), then yes, running a community support forum is a sensible choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the reason, I don’t tend to jump off bridges, just because someone else does it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You hypocrite! You advertise your software as a solution to MY problem on your website</p>

<p>Part of letting you use my solution is letting you know what problem I solve (by the way, that’s a service, saving you from reading the code in order to figure out what it does - you’re welcome). The conclusion that we both have the same problem was yours to draw. And yes, my software has long since grown beyond my own needs. But guess what, that still doesn’t compel me to work for you for free.</p>

<p>Hey, remember SourceForge? Used to be <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects. Got sold. New owners added shady <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge#Controversies">monetization practices</a>. Developers had a choice: leave and lose your backlinks or stay and have your reputation tarnished.</p>

<p>Hey, remember Github? Used to be <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects. Got sold. New owner is Microsoft! The queen of vendor lock-in and shady monetization practices. Developers had a choice: leave and lose your backlinks or stay and see what Microsoft will pull out of their hat in the coming years.</p>

<p>Hey, do you know Gitlab? It is <strong>the</strong> hosting platform for open source projects! <small>Until it will get sold!</small>
</p>

<p>Do you <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/why-not-use-github/">see the pattern here</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You made yourself the sole address for support. At least provide a community support forum!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outsource self-exploitation while eating up the infrastructure cost? Sounds like a plan. <strong>NOT!</strong> Get your ass out of your echo chamber. The idea of community support is one of the big criticisms <strong>against</strong> open source. When people have a problem, they want someone to talk to and they want their problem fixed in a timely manner. They don’t want to sign up for forum accounts and they don’t want to monitor them for weeks in the hopes that some community member might eventually come up with an answer.</p>

<p>When it comes to my software, I’m the most competent person to talk to. So whether I like to or not, people will (try to) contact me. As a developer, that puts a choice on your table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop your spare time being eaten up with tech support by pulling the software.</li>
<li>Start accepting payment and realize that you are now running a business that creates additional overhead cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I made myself the sole address for support. That is the only logical conclusion. If I’m running a business, why should I let it be cannibalized by running a public support forum / bug tracker? That’s just adding infrastructure cost to choke profit.</p>

<p>Math wiz ey? Ever tried applying a scaling factor to a project where the expenses exceed the revenue?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should have a donation button instead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea! How often do you click those?</p>

<p>Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.</p>

<p>I’m not running a charity and I don’t want your “support”. I want, same as you, being paid for the work I do. I find it utterly dishonest to put my work under an open source license, then spend a ridiculous amount of extra work on guilt tripping my users in order to collect alms.</p>

<p>If the license says, “the software is free to use”, then that’s the deal. You get exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is extra and billable.</p>

<p>As we’re approaching the end of the year, I just want to sum up the curl year with a few words.</p>



<p>2020 has been another glorious year in the curl project. We’ve seen a series of accomplishments and introductions of new things during this the year of the plague.</p>



<h2>Accomplishments</h2>



<p>I personally have done more commits in the git repository since any year after 2004 (890 so far).</p>



<p>The total number of commits done in git is the largest since 2014 (1445 plus some).</p>



<p>The number of published curl related CVEs is the lowest since 2013 (6). For the ones we announced, we could reward record amounts in our bug bounty program!</p>



<p>139 authors wrote commits that were merged (so far).</p>



<p>We did nine curl releases, out of which two unfortunately were quicker “panic releases” that patched up problems in the previous release.</p>



<h2>Seven changes to remember</h2>



<p>We’ve logged no less than <strong>905 bug-fixes</strong> and <strong>30 changes</strong> in the releases of this year, but the seven perhaps most memorable things we’ve introduced in 2020 are…</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/07/22/curl-goez-parallel/" data-type="post" data-id="12568">Parallel transfers</a> with curl</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/14/curl-mqtt-true/" data-type="post" data-id="13836">MQTT</a>://</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/03/hsts-your-curl/" data-type="post" data-id="11415">HSTS</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/09/04/curl-help-remodeled/" data-type="post" data-id="14601"><code>--help</code> refined</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/08/19/curl-7-72-0-more-compression/" data-type="post" data-id="14463">Zstd</a></li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/17/curl-write-out-json/" data-type="post" data-id="13740">JSON output</a> in -w</li><li><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/12/curl-even-more-wolfed/" data-type="post" data-id="13130">wolfSSH backend</a></li></ul>



<h2>Videos</h2>



<p>This year I’ve introduced the concept of doing a “release presentation” for every release. Those are videos where I go through and discuss the changes, the security releases and some interesting bug-fixes. Each release links to those from <a href="https://curl.se/changes.html">the changelog page</a> on the website.</p>



<h2>New home</h2>



<p>This is the year when we finally got ourselves a curl domain. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/04/the-journey-to-a-curl-domain/" data-type="post" data-id="14930">curl.se is our new home</a>.</p>



<h2>What didn’t happen</h2>



<p>We cancelled curl up 2020 due to Covid-19. It was planned to happen in Berlin. We did it purely online instead. We’re not planning any new physical curl up for 2021 either. Let’s just wait and see what happens with the pandemic next year and hope that we might be able to go back and have a physical meetup in 2022…</p>



<h2>It is a curl world</h2>

<p>Almost none of this will be new to you, but there is value in reminding yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn about things that you are curious about. Seems obvious, but put effort into it.</li>
<li>When you find a book that seems interesting, add it to a list. I use the Audible wish list. For regular books I just buy them on Ebay or Amazon.</li>
<li>If you have a task that takes less than 10 minutes, just do it now.</li>
<li>Keep a list of reminders. I like to set them so they notify me at weekly or monthly intervals.</li>
<li>Don’t take any small excuse as a sign not to work out. If you skip one day, definitely don’t skip the next.</li>
<li>Ordering yourself fun little toys on Ebay that take weeks to arrive is very fun.</li>
<li>Setting up a home desk with good equipment is well worth the cost. Your monitor, chair, keyboard and mouse should be good.</li>
<li>If I start gaming, I don’t sleep enough.</li>
<li>Businesses are hard to start. Try to test an idea before building the whole thing.</li>
<li>Go on walks.</li>
<li>Give away things you don’t really like.</li>
<li>Gigabit internet is not worth it. You won’t notice the difference between that and 300-500 Mbps. Save yourself the money.</li>
<li>Have a computer you really like to use, opting for a chromebook leads to much less productivity.</li>
<li>The point of creating an audience is to get feedback. Twitter or karma are not meaningless.</li>
<li>You won’t get an opposing opinion if you don’t seek it out.</li>
<li>Make sure the thing you are buying doesn’t charge via micro-usb.</li>
<li>Do small programming projects. It will help you learn and it’s a greate creative outlet.</li>
<li>People who are good writers or speakers have put a lot of effort into it.</li>
<li>Life is unpredictable, make sure you spend it with people you love.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what <a href="https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/">Arjun Guha</a> and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                                <p>Even a few minutes of research into the best journals and notebooks will yield a recommendation for the Traveler’s Notebook. The universal love of this notebook system makes it clear that this is one of the most unique stationery products sold today as well as being one of the one’s people are simply obsessed with.</p>
<p>So, what’s the deal with the Traveler’s Notebook?</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMxJPZN5hqE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Background">Traveler’s Notebook Background</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is made by the Traveler’s Company. This company is based in the&nbsp;Nakameguro section of Tokyo, Japan but the notebooks are sold all over the place, from an official company store at the Narita Airport (also in Tokyo) to paper stores all over the world. The notebooks and accessories are also sold many places online, including <a href="https://amzn.to/3gVgJAB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, and nearly ever premium stationery retailer.</p>
<p>The notebook might seem like something that has been made for dozens of years — a wonderful throwback to the pre-computer era — but that’s not the case. The standard Traveler’s notebook has been sold since 2006 and the smaller passport size first went on sale in 2010. The company that makes the Traveler’s notebook was original called Midori, but the name was changed to the “Traveler’s Company” in 2015.</p>
<p>The parent company of the Traveler’s Company as well as Midori Paper is Designphil Inc., which has been in existence since 1950 when it was formed under the name Midori Shokai Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>While officially known as the “Traveler’s Notebook” most people refer to the notebook as the “Travelers notebook,” dropping the possessive which seems unnecessary and counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>The Traveler’s Notebook is a notebook system, which is to say that there is no canonical “Traveler’s Notebook” but rather endless variations on the company’s notebook system. The basic components are a leather cover, notebook inserts, and then a range of accessories that include rubber bands, pockets, stickers and so forth.</p>
<p>The notebooks are prized for their ability to be refilled, their excellent accessories, and their ability to be incredibly customized so no two Traveler’s notebooks are alike.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Inserts">Traveler’s Notebook Inserts</span></h3>
<p>Each notebook is composed of a leather cover and then inserts. These insert components include:</p>
<ul><li>Covers</li>
<li>Refills</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
</ul><p>We’ll dig into each type in a bit.</p>
<h3><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Sizes">Traveler’s Notebook Sizes</span></h3>
<p>The notebooks are sold in two sizes: Regular and Passport. It’s critical to know what cover you have so that you buy the right inserts to fit it. The two sizes are different and are not cross compatible.</p>
<p>The only real difference between the two sizes are their dimensions. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 12.0 x 22.0 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>: 9.8 x 13.4 x 1.0 cm (W x H x D)</li>
</ul><p>The paper that each notebook uses is different as well. Traveler’s notebook paper has the following dimensions:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular</strong>: 11.0 x 21.0 x 0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
<li><strong>Passport</strong>:&nbsp;8.9 x 12.4 x&nbsp;0.4 cm (W x H x D)&nbsp;and 64 pages</li>
</ul><p>The notebooks do not adhere to <a href="https://unsharpen.com/paper-sizes/">standard paper sizes</a>. The closest standard sizes would be B6 for the Regular and B7 for Passport.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Covers">Traveler’s Notebook Covers</span></h2>
<p>The outside of a Traveler’s notebook is a single layer leather cover that is smooth on the outside and suede on the inside. It’s sold in black, brown, dark blue, and a reddish brown, known as “Camel.” The covers are made of a fine leather and they age wonderful, even if you are not particularly careful with them.</p>
<p>The covers lie nearly flat when open and have no branding on them. The main features on the cover are an elastic band that hold it shut and one that holds the inserts in place.</p>
<p>Each leather cover ships in a linen bag that protects it when en route to its own. The cover is prized by buyers but doesn’t have a purpose outside of presentation.</p>
<p>The leather covers are made in Thailand while all the paper is made in Japan.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Refills">Traveler’s Notebook Refills</span></h2>
<p>The refills are the beating heart of the notebook — they are the paper that goes inside. The refills come in Regular and Passport size, just like the covers and use excellent quality Midori paper, which is a major selling point, especially for fountain pen users. The paper does come in a number of varieties.</p>
<p>For the Regular size notebooks these include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong> Lightweight (Tomoe River), Sketch, Craft, Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong> Daily, Weekly, Weekly Vertical, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>For Passport the selection is a bit more limited:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Regular Paper, White</strong>: Blank, Lined, Dot Grid</li>
<li><strong>Regular Paper, Cream</strong>: Blank</li>
<li><strong>Special Paper:</strong>&nbsp;Watercolor</li>
<li><strong>Planners:</strong>&nbsp;Weekly, Weekly Mid-Year Start, Monthly</li>
</ul><p>While the notebooks are not a standard size, competing companies do make compatible notebooks. Some of the top options for these non-Traveler’s refills are Yamamoto with their Ro-Biki refills and Raymay’a A5 Slim refills.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Storage_Options">Traveler’s Notebook Storage Options</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s notebooks are small but mighty, partly because they have options for holding more than just your ideas.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OdwuGH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Card File</a> is a bit outdated in the era of the iPhone, but it’s use for storing business cards. There is also a Craft Paper Card File that will store more cards than the standard model, or can be used for assorted scraps of paper, stickers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Double-sided stickers are sold to insert photographs, cut out articles, and other mementos. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iR9knv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Film Pocket Sticker</a> is quite similar, but it’s actually a light plastic sticker that adheres to your notebook or inside a refill and then you can place a photo or piece of paper inside without damaging it. Traveler’s Pocket Stickers are similar but are angled at the top and fully open, so they can used for storing taller items. The Large Pocket Sticker can hole a full photograph or index card on its side.</p>
<p>The most robust storage options are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2W8Dau7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Zipper Case</a> and Three-fold File, which can handle larger items and much more of then. The Three-fold File for the standard notebook can even hold a full-sized piece of A4 paper that has been triple-folded (like a you would do to a letter). The Zipper Case can hold ink cartridges, a small pencil sharpener, paper clips, refills or other similar items that won’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Accessories">Traveler’s Notebook Accessories</span></h2>
<p>Traveler’s Company loves their accessories… and so do Traveler’s notebook enthusiasts. Some of the accessories include:</p>
<ul><li>Pen holder</li>
<li>Additional elastic bands (known as Connecting Bands)</li>
<li>Plastic Sheet Underlay</li>
<li>Repair Kit (replacement elastic bands)</li>
<li>Refill Binder (for storing refills that are full and no longer needed in your notebook)</li>
<li>Brass charm (for accessorizing the notebook)</li>
<li>Traveler’s Company stickers</li>
</ul><h2><span id="Travelers_Notebook_Alternatives">Traveler’s Notebook Alternatives</span></h2>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook might be a distinct thing made by a specific brand, but many other brands have recognized its success and sell similar products. After all, it’s not like the Traveler’s Company was the first to invent a leather notebook cover or to put excellent paper and handy pockets inside of a notebook, journal, folder, or folio!</p>
<p>The main choice with an alternative will be if you want a leather-covered notebook or just a customizable notebook system. Both of these are reasonable ways to define the Traveler’s system, so shop according to your desires for a leather cover, a modular notebook system, or both.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite options for alternatives are:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ATOyma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kokuyo Jibun Techo 2020 3 in 1 Set</a></strong></li>
<li>Kokuyo Systemic cover and notebooks</li>
<li>Chic Sparrow Notebook system</li>
<li>Field Notes Everyday Inspiration Leather Cover and memo pads</li>
<li>Bellroy leather notebook cover and notebook inserts</li>
</ul><h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Is_there_an_A5_sized_Travelers_Notebook">Is there an A5 sized Traveler’s Notebook?</span></h3>
<p>No, an official Traveler’s notebook in A5 does not exist. Chic Sparrow does sell a similar refillable, leather-covered notebook in A5 as do other, <a href="https://amzn.to/325etCx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">lesser known brands</a>, but Traveler’s does not.</p>
<h3><span id="How_do_I_care_for_a_Travelers_Notebook_leather_cover">How do I care for a Traveler’s Notebook leather cover?</span></h3>
<p>The leather cover on a Traveler’s notebook is made to wear in and weather over time. It uses a natural dye that is beautiful but not as tough as some other leather products. The leather should never be washed or cleaned except in the case of a spill where it can be blotted with a damp cloth.</p>
<h3><span id="What_do_I_do_if_the_Travelers_notebook_cover_gets_wet">What do I do if the Traveler’s notebook cover gets wet?</span></h3>
<p>If the leather cover gets wet, you should pat it dry, not rub it, so as to not pull out any of the natural dye. Unnecessary rubbing or friction can pull dye from the leather when it’s wet, so this should be minimized. When as much of the moisture is removed as possible the notebook should be emptied and left to dry in the shade, not out in the sun.</p>
<h3><span id="What_to_do_if_notebooks_cover_has_a_stain_or_blemish">What to do if notebook’s cover has a stain or blemish?</span></h3>
<p>The Traveler’s notebook’s cover was lightly treated exactly so that the cover could wear in. Try to ignore the blemish and continue to use the notebook. Over time it will wear and developer a patina and personality and the blemish will be unnoticeable (or at least well hidden). Unsightly stains and oil spots can be treated carefully with any leather cleaner or leather care cream, though try a small patch first to make sure the natural dye is not affected.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><h2>A Practical Analysis</h2><hr><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>Sony knew that 3D hardware can get very messy to develop for, for this reason, their new console will keep its design <em>simple</em> and <em>practical</em>… Although this may come with a cost!</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>The main processor is a modification of LSI’s <strong>CoreWare CW33300</strong> which, at the same time, is binary-compatible with SGI’s <strong>MIPS R3051</strong>. This chip runs at 33.87 MHz and it features:</p><ul><li>The <strong>MIPS I</strong> ISA: A 32-bit RISC instruction set, it includes multiplication and division instructions.</li><li><strong>One ALU and one shifter</strong>.</li><li><strong>5-stage pipeline</strong>: Up to five instructions can be executed simultaneously (a detailed explanation can be found in a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/#cpu">previous article</a>.</li><li><strong>4 KB instruction cache</strong> and <strong>1 KB of data cache</strong> (the original CoreWare CW33300 contained 2 KB of data cache): The data cache is actually <strong>Scratchpad RAM</strong>, meaning that it can have other uses apart from behaving as L1 cache.</li></ul><p>Like other MIPS R3000-based CPUs, it supported configurations with up to four coprocessors, Sony customised it with two:</p><ul><li><strong>System Control Coprocessor</strong> or ‘COP0’: A MMU that provides virtual memory by using a Translation Lookaside Buffer or ‘TLB’. Not all the features that come with virtual memory are available though, for example, memory protection is disabled since games are programmed for bare-metal (without running from an OS). On the other hand, this MMU still gives interrupt support, exception handling and breakpoints, these are used for debugging.</li><li><strong>Geometry Transformation Engine</strong> or ‘GTE’: A special math processor used for vector and matrix calculations. While only containing a fixed-point unit, it still provides useful operations for 3D graphics such as lighting and polygon transformations.</li></ul><p>Additionally, there’s an extra processor found in the main CPU:</p><ul><li><strong>Motion Decoder</strong> or ‘MDEC’: Provides <strong>full motion video</strong> playback (known as ‘FMV’) and transfers the decoded frames to the GPU using DMA.</li></ul><h4 id="taking-over-the-cpu">Taking over the CPU</h4><p>Sometimes any subsystem (graphics, audio or CD) may require large chunks of data at a fast rate, however the CPU may not be able to <em>always</em> keep up with the demand.</p><p>For this reason, the CD-ROM Controller, MDEC, GPU, SPU and the Parallel port have access to an exclusive <strong>DMA controller</strong> that takes control of the main bus whenever they require it.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>A large part of the graphics pipeline is carried out by the GTE. This includes perspective transformation, which projects the 3D space onto a 2D plane using the camera’s perspective. The processed data is then sent to Sony’s proprietary GPU for rendering.</p><h4 id="drawing-the-scene">Drawing the scene</h4><p>If you’ve been reading the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Sega Saturn article</a>, let me tell you that the design of this GPU <em>a lot</em> simpler!</p><p>Insomniac’s <em>Spyro: Year of the Dragon</em> will be used as example to show how a scene is drawn.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-models-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-models">Models</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-shaders-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-shaders">Shaders</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-textures-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-textures">Textures</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-models"><h4>Models</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps1/spyro/wireframes.ae3f1861c6c32f5405e24d638c42d0a12d52dbc2751989cc004a33df8c2e2904.png"><picture>

Being the only available primitive means that backgrounds and foregrounds make no difference in terms of composition (both are made of triangles). 2D games inherit the same nature: They are just flat polygons (two triangles joined to form a quadrangle). The GPU also includes routines for handling quadrangles as sprites.</p><p>The CPU sends geometry data to the GPU by filling its internal 64 byte FIFO buffer with <strong>commands</strong> (up to three). Basically, a command states how and where to draw one primitive. Once the geometry is received, <strong>clipping</strong> is applied to skip operations over unseen polygons (residing outside the camera’s viewport).</p><p>Compared to the more complex <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Sega Saturn</a>, the GPU only requires a <strong>single frame-buffer</strong>.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-shaders"><h4>Shaders</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps1/spyro/shaders.29a3d01cf71ab694462c42c4b9c0d637d427c0e3baa5f76a258185865d116fc6.png"><picture>

As you can imagine the results are more realistic. On the other hand, this algorithm is not available for sprites.</li></ul><p>The reason of having this choice comes down to the fact that Flat shading provides ~2.5 times more polygons per second than Gouraud, so it’s important to optimise which polygons need a more realistic shading than others.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-textures"><h4>Textures</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps1/spyro/result.a5e5bf7a5af4b0311f74520eddab5baa4b64ae5bbb73de5167dceb5b0627e42c.png"><picture>

This technique only operates using 2D coordinates (X/Y values) while discarding the third coordinate used for perspective (Z-value).</p><p>The unit also includes the following effects available to use:</p><ul><li><strong>Semi-Transparency</strong>: Simulates light passing through multiple textures.</li><li><strong>Dithering</strong>: Soften sudden changes in colour while adhering to the same colour palette.</li><li><strong>Fog</strong>: Simulates smoke in the environment.</li></ul><p>It’s worth mentioning that the PS1 happened to excel at those effects!</p></div></div></div><h4 id="designs">Designs</h4><p>Here are some examples of game characters designed from the ground up for the 3D era, they are interactive so I encourage you to check them out!</p><h4 id="playing-with-vram">Playing with VRAM</h4><p>The system features 1 MB of VRAM that will be used to store the frame-buffer, textures and other resources the GPU will need to access almost instantly. In theory, with the available amount of VRAM one could allocate a <em>massive</em> frame-buffer of 1024×512 pixels with 16-bit colours or a <em>realistic</em> one of 960×512 pixels with 24-bit colours allowing to draw the best frames any game has ever shown… This sounds pretty impressive right? Well, it does raise a couple of issues, for instance:</p><ul><li>Those dimensions will have to be rescaled to follow a standardised definition so the video encoder can broadcast it to conventional TVs.</li><li>How is the GPU going to be able to draw anything in time if there is no space left for the rest of materials (i.e.textures, colour tables, etc)?</li><li>The PS1’s GPU can only draw frame-buffers with up to 640×480 pixels and 16bpp colours.</li></ul><p>Alright, so let’s have a 16 bpp 640x480 buffer instead, which leaves 424 KB of VRAM for materials. So far so good? Again, such resolution may be fine on CRT monitors, but not really noticeable on those 90s TVs everyone had at their homes. Then, is there any way to optimise the frame-buffer? Introducing <strong>adjustable frame-buffers</strong>.</p><p>In essence, instead of wasting valuable VRAM by using ‘unappreciated’ resolutions, this console’s GPU allows to decrease the dimensions of the frame-buffer to effectively increment the space available for other resources.<br>A common setup consisted in dividing the 640x480 frame-buffer into two 320x480 ones, then using a technique called <strong>page-flipping</strong> to render multiple scenes at the same time. Page-flipping consists in switching the location of the frame for display between the two available whenever the game wants it, allowing the game to render one scene while displaying another, thus hiding any flickering effect and improving loading times (something that the player will certainly appreciate!).</p><p>Overall, our suggested layout only consumes 600 KB of VRAM. The rest (424 KB) was often used to store colour lookup-tables and textures that, combined with <strong>2 KB of texture cache available</strong>, results in a very convenient and efficient setup.</p><p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that VRAM can be mapped using <strong>multiple colour depths simultaneously</strong>, meaning that we could allocate a 16 bpp frame-buffer next to 24 bpp bitmaps (e.g. FMV frames). This is another feature facilitating further optimisation of space.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and Limitations</h4><p>Whereas the PS1 had a very simple and suitable architecture, problems ended up arising anyway. Surprisingly, certain issues were tackled with very clever workarounds!</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-wobbling-textures-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-wobbling-textures">Wobbling textures</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-visibility-approach-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-visibility-approach">Visibility approach</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-pre-rendered-graphics-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-pre-rendered-graphics">Pre-rendered graphics</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-wobbling-textures"><h4>Wobbling textures</h4><p><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps1/video_posters/ffviii.f3b56212cb3c0a1e4d7bf6554a334dde2ccbd19fbb0496cf6710f87856217676.jpg" preload="none" width="1052" height="720" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/ps1/ffviii.b65437715508333c5aa0bb5592aec740bdcde8ec1380f5cf0643aebd47b0aeaf.mp4" href="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/ps1/ffviii.b65437715508333c5aa0bb5592aec740bdcde8ec1380f5cf0643aebd47b0aeaf.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">
No support for video.</video><figcaption>Textures jiggle a bit while they move<br>Square Soft's Final Fantasy VIII (1999)</figcaption></p><p>The routines used for handling geometry and applying textures were known to carry some inaccuracies:</p><ul><li>GPU coordinates are <strong>limited to fixed-point units</strong>: That means no decimals (thus no precision), contributing to sudden jumps when polygons move slightly.</li><li>As you know, affine transformations have <strong>no sense of depth</strong>, which may confuse the user’s perception when the camera is close to the model and is positioned perpendicular to the viewer.</li><li>Finally, the smallest size of a polygon in this system <strong>is a pixel</strong>, making small polygons (no matter how small) to be rendered as a single pixel. Now, this means that textured polygons may lose part of their texture if their size becomes smaller than a pixel. Furthermore, complex models may suffer from edges constantly shaking.<ul><li>This effect is more apparent when using a small frame-buffer or rendering models at a distance. Modern systems tackled this by implementing sub-pixel resolution methods, which handles polygons using fractions of pixels.</li></ul></li></ul><p>These explain why users may notice instabilities while playing some games. The effect is also referred as <strong>texture warping</strong>, some games often resorted to <strong>tessellation</strong> (dividing a big polygon into smaller ones) in order to reduce these unwanted effects, others just reduced the amount of textures in favour of <strong>solid colours</strong>.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-visibility-approach"><h4>Visibility approach</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps1/crash.27299c815f5930ce9e9abcde59760ae3e9a534d4cd90008b308b8205965f4d93.jpg"><picture>

<p>I’m talking to you, Mr. or Mrs. Person who keeps saying “I should really start a blog.” Or maybe it’s more like “I should really post to my poor, lonely blog.”</p>



<p>Yes, you should. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/02/write-5x-more-but-write-5x-less/">I already wrote my manifesto on why</a>, so I won’t repeat it here. But you should. So either <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">do it or stop talking about it</a>.</p>



<p>Stop waiting for motivation, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/18/discipline-eats-motivation-for-breakfast/">use some discipline</a>. Make writing a part of your daily routine.</p>



<p>For me, when I sit down at my desk in the morning I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/18/100-daily-blog-posts/">write a quick blog post</a>. It’s how I ramp up for the day. Maybe that works for you too, and maybe not. But either way, work it into your routine somewhere or it won’t become a habit.</p>



<p>Do it, right now. Schedule it on <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">your calendar</a>. Make a plan. Tell yourself it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">just an experiment</a>, so it’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">not scary</a> or permanent.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ll be glad you did. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">I know I am</a>!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used audio software on the computer, you probably know that MIDI exists: a signalling protocol that allows controllers to control virtual instruments like synths. It’s also the protocol used by real audio hardware to talk to each, and you can think of it as the language in which, rathar than communicating a fluctuating voltage signal or series of discrete sample values, devices talk about what is being done on them (“A4 got pressed”, “F4 got released”,  “the mod wheel moved down”, etc).</p>

<p>As such, there are two ways to record digital instruments (real or virtual): you can record the sound they’re making, or you can record the MIDI events that cause them to make those sounds, and that’s where things get interesting.</p>

<p>There are many, <em>many</em> ways to record audio, from microphones to line monitors to audio interfaces, on dedicated hardware, computers, phones, etc. etc., but there aren’t all that many ways to record MIDI events. Essentially: unless you’re running software that monitors MIDI events, there just isn’t really any way to record MIDI. So I set out to change that: in the same way that you can just hook up an audio field recorder (like a Tascam DR-05) to sit between an audio-out on something that generates audio and an audio-in on something that should be listening to that audio, writing that to an SD card as <code>.wav</code> or <code>.mp3</code> or the like,  I built a MIDI “field recorder” that you plug in between your MIDI-out and some MIDI-in, indiscriminately recording every MIDI event that gets sent over the wire to an SD card as a <code>.mid</code> file.</p>

<p>You’d think this would be something that already exists as a product you can just buy (even if at probably quite the markup because it’s made of “powder-coated extruded aluminium” with “audiophile quality” components, but still). Amazingly, it is not. There’s just nothing.</p>

<p>So: if you want a MIDI recorder, you’ll have to build one… and if you want to build one, this post might be useful to you!</p>

<h2 id="the-circuitry">The circuitry</h2>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/banner.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/banner.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

<p>To build this, we’re going to basically build a standard “MIDI-In + MIDI-Thru” circuit using an Arduino, with an SD card module hooked up so we can save the data that comes flying by. To build everything, we’ll need some special components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino SD card module (~$10 for a pack of five)</li>
  <li>Two female 5-pin DIN connectors (~$5 for a pack of ten)</li>
  <li>A 6N138 optocoupler (~$10 for a pack of ten)</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, the bits that you’ll get with pretty much any Arduino starter kit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Arduino UNO R3 or equivalent board</li>
  <li>3x 220 ohm resistors</li>
  <li>1x 4.7k ohm resistor</li>
  <li>A diode</li>
  <li>A piezo buzzer</li>
  <li>A clicky pushy button</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-midi-part-of-our-recorder">The MIDI part of our recorder</h3>

<p>We set up MIDI-In on the Arduino <code>RX&lt;-0</code> pin, with MIDI-Thru tapping straight into signal that’s getting sent to <code>RX&lt;-0</code>, too. The only tricky bit about this is that MIDI signals are isolated from the rest of the circuitry via an optocoupler (which gets around ground loop problems by literally transmitting signals by running them through a LED, which emits the electrical signal as light, which then gets picked up by a phototransistor that turns the light back into an electrical signal). When placing and connecting the optocoupler, it is very important to make sure you know which pin is pin 1: it’ll have a little mark next to it (typically a dot on the chip casing) to tell you that that side has pins 1 through 4 running top to bottom, and pins 5 through 8 on the other side <em>running bottom to top</em>. Also note that we’re not using pins 1 and 4 for this circuit: only pins 2 and 3 are connected to the MIDI-In connector, and pins 5 through 8 are connected to the various arduino pins.</p>

<p><img alt="MIDI circuit diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/MIDI.png" width="75%"></p>

<p>(I know, “Thru isn’t a word!”, but that’s what <a href="http://www.shclemen.com/download/The%20Complete%20MIDI1.0%20Detailed%20Spec.pdf#page=7&amp;zoom=auto,-206,478">the MIDI spec</a> calls it, so English gets to take a back seat here…)</p>

<h3 id="the-sd-part-of-our-recorder">The SD part of our recorder</h3>

<p>The SD card circuitry is literally just a matter of “connect the pins to the pins”, with the only oddity being that the pins don’t <em>quite</em> line up well enough to literally just stick the SD card module directly into the Arduino.</p>

<p>However, note that your SD card module <strong>may have a different pin layout</strong> so be sure to double-check before wiring things up!</p>

<p><img alt="SD module diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/sd%20card.png" width="50%"></p>

<h3 id="adding-a-beep-for-debugging">Adding a beep, for debugging</h3>

<p>Also, we’re going to add a little piezo speaker and a button that we can press to turn on (or off) playing a note corresponding to a MIDI note getting played, mostly as the audio equivalent of visual debugging. There’s barely any work here: we hook up the “speaker” between pin 8 and ground, and the button to pin 2. Beep, beep!</p>

<p><img alt="beep beep button diagram" src="https://pomax.github.io/arduino-midi-recorder/button.png" width="50%"></p>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>With the circuitry set up, let’s start writing our program, focussing on dealing with each circuit in its own section</p>

  <li><a href="#midi-handling">basic signal handling (MIDI library)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-management">basic file writing (SD library)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#making-some-beeps">Audio debugging (beep beep)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#creating-a-new-file-when-idling">Usability bonus: “clean restart” on idle</a></li>
  <li><a href="#a-final-helper-script">Usability bonus 2: “fix the track length” script</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="program-basics">Program basics</h3>

<p>Our basic program will need to import the standard <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SD">SD</a> library, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library">MIDI</a> library (which you’ll probably need to <a href="https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library#getting-started">install first</a>).</p>

<p>Note that if you don’t want to “follow along” and instead you just want the code, you can copy-paste the code found over in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pomax/arduino-midi-recorder/master/midi-recorder.ino">midi-recorder.ino</a> into the Arduino IDE.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;SD.h&gt;
#include &lt;MIDI.h&gt;
</span>
<span>MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE</span><span>();</span>

<span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// we'll put some more code here in the next sections</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we’re done!</p>

<p>Of course this doesn’t <em>do</em> anything yet, so let’s add the rest of the code, too.</p>

<h3 id="midi-handling">MIDI handling</h3>

<p>For our MIDI handling, we’ll need to set up listeners for MIDI events, and make sure to poll for that data during the program loop:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>setup</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span><span>MIDI_CHANNEL_OMNI</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOn</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>handleNoteOff</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>handlePitchBend</span><span>);</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>setHandleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>handleControlChange</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>loop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MIDI</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This sets up MIDI listening on all MIDI channels (there are sixteen of them, and we don’t want to guess which channels are active), and reads out the MIDI data from <code>RX&lt;-0</code> - you may have noticed we don’t explicitly set a baud rate: the MIDI spec only allows for 31,250 bits per second, so the Arduino MIDI library automatically makes sure to set the correct polling rate for us.</p>

<p>That leaves implementing our MIDI event handling:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define NOTE_OFF_EVENT 0x81
#define NOTE_ON_EVENT 0x91
#define CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT 0xB1
#define PITCH_BEND_EVENT 0xE1
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_OFF_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>NOTE_ON_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>velocity</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>CONTROL_CHANGE_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>controller</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>bend_value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// First off, we need to "recenter" the bend value,</span>
  <span>// because in MIDI, the bend value is a positive value</span>
  <span>// in the range 0x0000-0x3FFF with 0x2000 considered</span>
  <span>// the "neutral" mid point:</span>
  <span>bend_value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0x2000</span><span>;</span>
  
  <span>// Then, per the MIDI spec, bend_value is 14 bits, and</span>
  <span>// needs to be encoded as two 7-bit bytes, encoded as</span>
  <span>// the lowest 7 bits in the first byte, and the highest</span>
  <span>// 7 bits in the second byte:</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>lowBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>
  <span>byte</span> <span>highBits</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>((</span><span>bend_value</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0x7F</span><span>);</span>

  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(</span><span>PITCH_BEND_EVENT</span><span>,</span> <span>lowBits</span><span>,</span> <span>highBits</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(note that we’re ignoring the <code>channel</code> byte: we’ll be creating a “simple” format 0 MIDI file, and for maximum usability in terms of importing our data in a DAW, we’re putting all the events on channel 2)</p>

<p>This is a good start, but MIDI events are just that: events, and events happen “at some specific time” which we’re still going to have to capture. MIDI events don’t rely on absolute time based on some kind of real time clock (which is good for us, because Arduino doesn’t have an RTC built in!) and instead relies on counting a “time delta”: it marks events with the number of “MIDI clock ticks” since the previous event, with the very first event in the event stream having an explicit time delta of zero.</p>

<p>So: let’s write a <code>getDelta()</code> function that we can use to get the number of MIDI ticks since the last event (=since the last time <code>getDelta()</code> got called) so that we have all the data we need ready to start writing MIDI to file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>startTime</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
    <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>startTime</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>millis</span><span>();</span>
  <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>now</span> <span>-</span> <span>lastTime</span><span>);</span>
  <span>lastTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>now</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function seems bigger than it has to be: we <em>could</em> just start the clock when our sketch starts, setting <code>lastTime=millis()</code> in <code>setup()</code>, and then in <code>getDelta</code> only have the <code>timeDelta</code> calculation and <code>lastTime</code> update, but that would be explicitly encoding “a lot of nothing” at the start of our MIDI file: we’d be counting the ticks for the first event relative to starting the program, rather than treating the first event as starting at tick zero. So instead, we explicitly encode the time that the first event happens as <code>startTime</code> and then we start delta calculation relative to that, instead.</p>

<p>That then leaves updating our handlers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOn</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(...,</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleNoteOff</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>velocity</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(...,</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handleControlChange</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>controller_code</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(...,</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>handlePitchBend</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>bend_value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>writeToFile</span><span>(...,</span> <span>getDelta</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which means we can move on to actually writing MIDI data to a <code>.mid</code> file!</p>

It should be noted, however, that while the same scales were used, we did not explicitly ask developers to compare indicators across categories. </p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/71dl1PB5y0WDLuLkxPBfo/ba9c456d956887fad7261cd24bd8bdf3/DHI_26.jpg" alt="Happiness Indicators ranking"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div><p>The importance of work to happiness is not just true for developers. In fact, one of the most robust findings in the study of happiness is <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/does-work-make-you-happy-evidence-from-the-world-happiness-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>that unemployment is destructive to people’s wellbeing</u></a>. This is true across age, gender and country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to Harvard Business Review, employed people are happier and have less negative emotional experiences in their day to day lives. Further, non-monetary aspects of employment, such as social status, social relations, daily structure and goal achievement, are key drivers of well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we spend a great deal of our lives working, it is inevitable that work plays a key role in shaping our levels of happiness. <b>From our analysis, we found that for developers, happy jobs are remarkably similar to happy countries: stable leadership, autonomy and a sense of self-determination and achievement</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Healthcare and safety also ranked very highly as indicators of happiness amongst developers. Health and happiness are self-reinforcing, happier people tend to be healthier.</p><p>Across segments, developer happiness remained fairly constant, be it by age, gender or coding experience. <b>As developers get older and gain more experience, they grow slightly less happy.</b> Female developers are slightly more happy than male developers, though again there is only a small difference between these two groups. </p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/3za8pmA0KcBW8plXsDBXmF/76fce841b133da3b54834e9c5f216987/DHI_27.jpg" alt="Developers tend to slightly happier at the start of their career"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/2B6tpTwJhihnoKVUoFtDKJ/6c98740a3cab48e9704ecd9cff2ed6a0/DHI_28.jpg" alt="Female vs. male developer happiness"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div id="career"><h3>Deep Dive: Career</h3><ul><li><p><b>Work-life balance is the most important predictor</b> of developer career happiness.</p></li><li><p>Developers in <b>Northern Europe are most satisfied with their work-life balance</b> — they also work the shortest hours.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Satisfaction with work-life balance increases in trusting environments</b>, where developers feel they have flexibility in their schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Older developers are less satisfied with working environments and company culture and <b>begin to face ageism from the age of 29</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Women are more satisfied than men with their salaries, though a large gender pay gap exists. <b>The pay gap is largest in North and South America</b>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The happiest developers at work live in the Scandinavian countries of Northern Europe. <b>The unhappiest at work are based in Southern Europe</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Companies with high employee happiness outperform their peers.</b> </p></li></ul></div><div><h3>Work-Life Balance: The Most Important Factor for Developer Happiness at Work&nbsp;</h3><p>We all want to live rich and meaningful lives — at work and home — without sacrificing important aspects of either. When the balance is skewed, it can affect one’s physical and mental well-being, and that’s when things start to fall apart both inside and outside of work.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Work-life balance is the most important indicator for developer happiness at work</b>, regardless of experience, age, gender, position and region. 75% of developers cited this factor as “very important,” and 39% consider themselves “very satisfied”. </p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/2FOtOi9sjfmJW5HUIANVvx/8ea31786024b1596b63418d6e18cdb79/DHI_08.jpg" alt="Work-Life Balance Graph"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div><p>Satisfaction with work-life balance can vary quite dramatically depending on which region of the world you are working in as a developer. The geographical variance may give some hints to international companies about which factors matter when considering long term policies to increase satisfaction with work-life balance.&nbsp;</p><p><b>More than half of developers located in the Scandinavian and Nordic countries of Northern Europe are very satisfied with their work-life balance, </b>higher than anywhere else in the world.<b> </b>They also enjoy shorter working hours on average than developers in all other regions (when measured by % working a 40 - 60 hour week).</p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/4hosAg4SFqfQUFgQRGh7j6/d4d60dc2ccab35d1aef28d069a58be47/DHI_29.jpg" alt="Work-life balance satisfaction in regions"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/dacP84MCisSCs05OYTKCW/4c9e43180a889ee943b9730e86130a6c/DHI_30.jpg" alt="40-60 weeks per region"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div><p>Countries like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/22/how-stockholm-became-the-city-of-work-life-balance#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sweden</u></a>, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/business/2017/02/20/scandinavian-work-culture-is-better-than-yours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denmark</u></a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190807-why-finland-leads-the-world-in-flexible-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Finland</u></a> are pioneers in policies promoting healthy work-life balance, which allow people to remain productive while accommodating the demands of everyday life.&nbsp;</p><p>The positive results from Scandinavia’s six-hour work days or four-day-weeks aren’t isolated to Europe; practices like these have been trialled in <a href="https://www.workflexibility.org/take-five-stanford-economist-nicholas-bloom-business-case-telecommuting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chinese call centres</u></a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/international/microsoft-4-day-work-week-boosts-productivity-2019-11/?r=US&amp;IR=T#:~:text=Microsoft%20experimented%20with%20a%204,and%20productivity%20jumped%20by%2040%25&amp;text=Microsoft%20found%20that%20implementing%20a,Work%2DLife%20Choice%20Challenge.%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Microsoft offices in Japan</u></a> with similar indications of increased productivity.&nbsp;</p><p>Scandinavia’s success in promoting work-life balance is powered by the <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/survey_finland_ranks_number_one_in_citizen_trust/10270981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>high amount of trust</u></a> between people, a culture of collaboration and preference for consensus-based decisions, which leads to greater feelings of autonomy.</p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/2mzSlc6A2c5eqLBkDo9cYs/39c9aceff0bc4da440b4393b17c2a077/DHI_31.jpg" alt="Ideas for better work-life balance"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div><p><b>Developers located in North America are the second-most satisfied with their work-life balance despite working the longest hours of any region on average</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the United States, large tech companies like Amazon, IBM and others, employ the greatest number of <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/14/compaies-hiring-software-developers-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>developers countrywide</u></a> and are at the forefront of progressive work cultures. These companies are renowned for implementing policies similar to Scandinavia, such as parental leave, health insurance and dental plans.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Countries in Southern Europe work longer hours over longer work days and have lower salaries compared to countries in Western and Northern Europe.</b> In 2016, Spain’s employment minister <a href="https://communications.freshfields.com/files/uploads/documents/ludovica/Right%20to%20disconnect%20-%20for%20ILLB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>called for companies</u></a> to allow their employees to finish their workday at 6 p.m. rather than the long-held 8 p.m., which was no longer punctuated by long breaks.</p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/2PlrC3DlyY08zswEveXAbX/29f99a8d4b30204d5a352648feaf407a/DHI_12.jpg" alt="40-60 work hours by country"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div><p>In our results, developers talk about how work-life balance can negatively impact their happiness and mental health. Some developers complain that “unpaid overtime is expected from you as a developer these days” and that the lack of work-life balance “leads to the prevalence of mental disorders and burnout across the industry.”&nbsp;</p><p>Remote work is often cited as a means to improve work-life balance. In our open comments section, remote work is mentioned nearly 200 times, particularly as a solution for noisy open offices and long commute times. COVID-19 has pushed many teams into remote situations and over time we will see if this does indeed impact happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s often the temptation to make quick changes to improve work-life balance, but companies need to commit time and effort for policies to be successful. A 2019 Harvard Business Review article summarised the <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/better-work-life-balance-starts-with-managers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>traps of implementing policies</u></a> that are not well thought through:</p><ul><li><p><b>Flexibility does not always translate into a better work-life balance</b>. Since employees can communicate with colleagues through their devices at any time, remote workers often experience <b>high work-intensity and reduced autonomy. </b>This constant connectivity can blur the boundaries between work and non-work activities.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Paid family leave or childcare support <b>can raise perceptions of unfairness in the workforce</b>. Such policies are typically reserved for workers with caregiving responsibilities. They are much less accessible to workers who desire the same level of work-life balance but lack urgent family responsibilities.</p></li><li><p>The majority of employees who do have access to flexible work arrangements are reluctant to use them. <b>Many fear that doing so shows low work-commitment</b> and will harm their career.</p></li></ul><p>To maintain happy developers, it is essential to not only promote a healthy work-life balance but to live it. Employers need to train supervisors to be positive role models and offer practical and emotional support in topics related to work-life balance. </p></div><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/3zvffpH2ydQNkfQQ5kE3iO/10e6dfb96e4189a00befe8b604f41314/DHI_32.jpg" alt="How managers can support work-life balance"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Female developers place a higher importance on work-life balance than male developers. 81% of women say work-life balance is very important for career happiness, compared to 75% of men. </p><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/TjYrlvySF8a1DaaCvwQA7/d3a550214adb81992726398a7011df5b/DHI_33.jpg" alt="Work-life balance for female developers"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Organisations that create positive work-life policies and train managers to implement them enjoy greater success in …</p></div></div>

				<p><a href="http://www.eternityroad.info/index.php/weblog/screeds/14/">Robert Conquest’s Three Laws of Politics</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.  </li>
<li>Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.  </li>
<li>The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/03_06_22_corner-archive.asp#010158">John Derbyshire</a> adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the Second Law, Conquest gave the Church of England and Amnesty International as examples. Of the Third, he noted that a bureaucracy sometimes actually <em>is</em> controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies — e.g. the postwar British secret service. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tinyvital.com/BlogArchives/000322.html">John Moore</a> thinks the third law is <em>almost</em> right; it should read “assume that it is controlled by a cabal of <em>the enemies of the stated purpose of that bureaucracy</em>.”</p>
<p>Francis W. Porretto notes that Cyril Northcote Parkinson studied the same phenomenon of bureaucratic behavior:</p>
<blockquote><p>Parkinson promulgated a number of laws of bureaucracy that serve to explain a huge percentage of its characteristics. They’ve exhibited remarkable predictive power within their domain. The first of these is the best known:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Parkinson’s First Law</strong>: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parkinson inferred this effect from two central principles governing the behavior of bureaucrats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Officials want to multiply subordinates, not rivals. </li>
<li>Officials make work for one another. </li>
</ol>
<p>Like most generalizations, these are not always true…but the incentives that apply specifically to tax-funded government bureaucracies make them true much more often than not. They make a striking contrast with the almost exactly opposite behavior observable in private enterprise.<br>[...]<br>That young bureaucrat will profit from deliberate ineffectiveness to the extent that he can get himself viewed as an asset by his superiors and a non-threat by his peers. His superiors want him to produce justifications for the enlargement of their domains. His peers simply ask that he not tread on their provinces. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miltion Friedman noted that bureaucratic resource allocation involves spending other people’s money on other people, so there are no compelling reasons to control either cost or quality — but a bureaucrat will learn, given time, how to “spend on others” in such a fashion that the primary benefit flows to himself.</p>
<p>To do this, bureaucrats must manage perceptions, so that their work seems both necessary and successful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Von Clausewitz and others have termed war “a continuation of politics by other means,” but when viewed from the perspective of the State Department official, war is the declaration that his organization has failed of its purpose. He sees it as bad public relations for his entire function. Thus, even when the nation’s interests would be overwhelmingly better served by war than by the continuation of diplomacy, the State Department man will prefer diplomacy. It’s in his demesne, and enhances his prestige by enhancing the prestige of his trade.</p>
<p>It’s not too much to say that averting war regardless of its desirability or justifiability is near the top of every State Department functionary’s list of priorities. In this pursuit, the State Department will often find itself opposing even peacetime operations of the military designed to improve its effectiveness, such as the acquisition of new weapons or the enlargement of its ranks. </p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>What do you want to do with your life?</p><p>Many of us haven’t stopped to ask the question. When we try, we find the answer doesn’t come so easy. </p><p>Why? Our lives are filled with opportunity. We can move to any city, work in any profession, and pursue just about any hobby. <sup>1</sup></p><p>At this level of optionality, where do you start? It gets more confusing too. As you contend with these choices, an invisible hand biases all of your decisions. This is the hand of society: through prestige and status, it can get us to do just about anything.</p><p>Yet, we only live once. Should we spend our lives following the whims of society, thrown about in this tempest of choice? How can we silence the noise and find what we uniquely want to do? </p><p>Here’s how I think about it.</p><p>Start bottom up. Instead of surveying all the choices ahead of you, just ask yourself: what are you doing <em>right now?</em> </p><p>Take a few hours and jot down all your to-dos in a document. Maybe you need to send a gift to a friend, call a family member, or finish a feature. As you jot these to-dos down, you’ll build up a snapshot of what your priorities are <em>right now</em>. </p><p>Here’s how this looks like for me: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzEwMzEwMzMxNy0zYjBhNWQwMC00NWVlLTExZWItODU4NS1kOGQ3MzNjODYyYzIucG5n" alt="image"></span></p><p>(There are about a hundred other tasks like this) </p><p>Once you finish jotting the to-dos down, clean them up and clarify them. Work over them until you feel like you know exactly what’s ahead. When you finish, you’ll feel a sigh of relief. </p><p>At least for the next few weeks, you know what to do now.</p><p>Now you see a few weeks ahead. You can stop here, or you can go further. This snapshot can serve as a foundation for your longer-term goals.</p><p>Go through the to-dos once more, but this time look for patterns. Do some to-dos clump together? </p><p>Take note of why: Maybe you’ll notice that a lot of to-dos clump towards relationships. Or you have a clump about improving your craft. Or finance. Or family. </p><p>Once you finish, you’ve just revealed your active “themes” in life. Like it or not, these themes are what you are prioritizing and are likely to impact over the next year or two.</p><p>Now, let’s tame them.</p><p>How are you doing in each theme? Where do you think they’re heading over the next year or two? Do you like where they’re headed? Are there some themes that are unimportant to you, that you should drop? Perhaps most importantly, are there some themes that you want to impact, but they don’t show up in your priorities? </p><p>Answer these questions, change the themes around, and you’ll end up naturally forming your goals over the next few years. </p><p>Here’s how these look like for me:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzEwMzEwMzMyMi00NDkzYzUwMC00NWVlLTExZWItOGVjMC00MWJkNTcxNTU3MTMucG5n" alt="image"></span></p><p>We started off with to-dos, sprouted themes, and even have goals for the next few years. We now have a much better sense of what we value. </p><p>Can we take it further? What about 5 years or further?</p><p>We face the same challenge: the world is so dynamic it’s hard to think about what 5 to 10 years ahead looks like. Here’s a different way to look at it:</p><p>Pick some age that’s interesting to you, maybe ~5 years ahead. Now, instead of thinking about all that you’ll have done by then, ask yourself: <em>what does an ideal day look at that age?</em></p><p>You’ve reduced the solution from all achievements to just one slice: a day in the life. To figure this out, you can start with grounded questions: What time do you wake up? Where do you wake up? Is someone with you? What does your house look like? What do you look like? What’s the first thing you do? </p><p>And so on. Here’s what this looks like for me: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0LzEwMzEwMzMyNC00ZDg0OTY4MC00NWVlLTExZWItOWU0ZC1kZjcxOGIwYzM2ZDAucG5n" alt="image"></span></p><p>As you write this, you’ll constantly surprise yourself. The themes you figured out will start coalescing into long-term direction, and sprout up in the essay. You may start with apparently frivolous things, and discover that they represent a much deeper idea. </p><p>The best part is, that these documents react to each-other. You may find new themes that sprout up in writing your this reflection, which will affect your mid-term goals, which will affect this reflection all over again. </p><p>You now have a vision at least 5 years ahead. Because you started with your real to-dos, you know it’s grounded in reality, and since you pruned based on how you felt about each theme, you know you’ve avoided at least some of the trappings of society.</p><p>Wow, from just to-dos we’ve gone 5 years ahead. What do we do from here?</p><p>As you experience reality, you’ll get more and more information about what you intrinsically value. You’ve thought so deeply that you can more confidently ask the larger questions life: from what’s important in society to how you can help. To get a sense of what this kind of information can look like, here’s a question to get you started: who are the people you respect, and why?</p><p>Keep these documents alive. Integrate your experience and evolve your ideas. You may go in directions you would never have thought of. I doubt the 5 year plan will work out as you expected when you write it. But, it can help you reveal your preferences, your values, and act as an anchor in the tempest of change.</p><p>You have only one life. I hope you live it doing what you love, amongst people you love.</p><p>A lot of people and a lot of books have influenced my thinking on this. I think David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”, and “Making it all Work”, are responsible for many ideas in this essay. Ramit Sethi influenced the “focus on now”, and PG influenced “bottom-up design”. I no longer follow GTD (my productivity looks much more similar to pmarca’s <a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html" target="_blank">advice</a>), but I suggest diving into all of these authors 🙂. </p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Jacky Wang, Ian Sinnott, Irakli Popkhadze, Davit Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Sean Grove, Alex Kotliarskyi, Sepehr Pariokh for reviewing drafts of this essay.</em></p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

              <p>Anonymous posts on Gurlic are quite straight-forward. There is an actual user with the username <code>anonymous</code>. Whenever a new anonymous post is created, the database query looks like this:</p><pre><code>INSERT into posts(content, user_id) 
VALUES($1, (SELECT id from users where username='anonymous'))</code></pre><p>Initially, I wanted a way for users to be able to edit their anonymous posts. That is a little tricky though, because there has to be some record that ties the user to the post itself - which defeats the purpose of anonymous posts. In the case of a database leak, that connection is out in the public. We don't want that.</p><p>So anonymous posts are pretty much a one-off action because once they're created, the user no longer has any control over them - whether it's editing the post, marking it as NSFW, deleting it and so on. </p><p>This also means that the <code>anonymous</code> user has a <a href="https://gurlic.com/anonymous" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">profile</a>, just like any other user, and can be followed, mentioned etc.</p><p>I'm sure someone has a much better way to implement anonymous posts that are tied to the users that created them, while being secure at the same time. It does seem like a lot of extra work though. </p><p>Why be not lazy when you can be lazy?</p>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>
<p>Bis dahin wollen wir Ideen sammeln, wie wir zusammen die rC3 gestalten wollen.<br>
Was erwarten wir von einer Remote-Veranstaltung?<br>
Welche neuen Formate, Spiele und Easter-Eggs sind möglich?<br>
Was können wir beitragen?<br>
Und welche Fehler sollten die C3-Teams beim Planen vermeiden?</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jedes Input unter<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>Wann ist das nochmal?</h2>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>
<h2>When is it again?</h2>
<p>Save the date:<br>
December 27-30, 2020<br>
Online and in your local hackspace with your preferred infection community</p>

December 24, 2020 | https://blog.selfthinker.org/2012/10/20/the-story-behind-dokuwikis-new-template/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.selfthinker.org/2012/10/20/the-story-behind-dokuwikis-new-template/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/">DokuWiki</a> finally has a new default template (aka skin or theme) since its latest release (2012-10-13 “Adora Belle”). It has been active on dokuwiki.org for a few months now and I’m happy that the general opinion of it seems to be “awesome”. 🙂</p>
<p>That template has a long and interesting story to tell, especially about processes in the OpenSource community and the lack of designers therein. Even professional web developers will probably be surprised at how much effort actually went into making it.<br>
So, here is its story:<br>
<span id="more-551"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_583"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-0-old.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-583" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-0-old-300x164.png" alt="" title="Old default template" width="300" height="164" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-583">This is DokuWiki’s old default template from 2004 until 2012. The main look and feel was taken from Plone CMS and mainly extended by Andreas Gohr and others.</p></div>
<p>We’ve been unhappy with the old default template and had plans to write a new one for a very long time now. It’s eight years old and in desperate need of some modernisation. I don’t remember exactly when was the first time we talked about it, but I remember at least when <a href="http://www.splitbrain.org/">Andreas Gohr</a> (the lead developer of DokuWiki) added <a href="http://xref.dokuwiki.org/reference/dokuwiki/_functions/tpl_include_page.html">tpl_include_page()</a> (which was on <a href="https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/commit/a81910eeb4ef1a5c5faf27732de90cc8ea49389b">5 June 2009</a>) that it was already meant for the new template, and by that time the idea was already “old”. I found a private email to Andi in which I wrote that I started the template dating back to 10 May 2009. And Andi remembered that he did the <a href="http://xref.dokuwiki.org/reference/dokuwiki/_functions/tpl_actiondropdown.html">tpl_actiondropdown()</a> also for the idea of making the new default template more mobile friendly and that was even further back (<a href="https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/commit/a00de5b59af578ac2c2a88d06027a06fc0d9ae1d">17 August 2008</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_586"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-1-starter.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-586" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-1-starter-300x193.png" alt="" title="Starter template" width="300" height="193" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-586">This is the Starter template by Anika Henke (2010). It formed the code base of all following tries of default template implementations.</p></div>
<p>I actually started to prepare the template back in 2009 (not quite sure when exactly, might even have been 2008?). But as we were lacking designers and professional design ideas, I went ahead and released it “without a design” as the <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:starter">Starter template</a> in November 2010. I was planning to use it as the base for the default template whenever we’d have a design. And that plan succeeded, the new template is indeed based on the Starter template.<br>
The main idea behind the Starter template was (and still is) to improve its <strong>maintainability</strong> by structuring the code in a way which makes it easier for template authors to understand the code and to start or maintain another template.</p>
<div id="attachment_595"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-2-esther-implementation.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-595" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-2-esther-implementation-300x219.png" alt="" title="First design" width="300" height="219" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-595">This is the first try, designed by Esther Brunner (September 2010) and implemented by Esther Brunner, Anika Henke and Andreas Gohr (until January 2011).</p></div>
<p>Then <a href="http://wikidesign.ch/">Esther Brunner</a> designed a first draft of a new design at the <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/devel:hackfest:2010-zurich">Hackfest in Zurich</a> in September 2010. Esther has been a very active plugin and template developer during the first few years, but has retired from DokuWiki since then.<br>
We started to <a href="https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki-template-dokuwiki">implement her design</a> there and then and continued to work on it for a couple of months. I personally didn’t like that design much, but Andi liked it. At least we solved a few “positioning problems” and had a few important discussions. But none of us had any time and energy to move it forward and it lay idle since then.</p>
<div id="attachment_579"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-3-clarence-first.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-579" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-3-clarence-first-300x201.png" alt="" title="Second design and implementation" width="300" height="201" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-579">This is the first try by Clarence Lee (August 2011).</p></div>
<p>In July 2011 I asked my then-colleague <a href="http://clarencelee.co.uk/">Clarence Lee</a> (a UX Designer with a strong coding background) if he might be interested in designing the new template. Luckily, he was! 🙂<br>
He had already helped me with the Starter template (mainly typography-related things, but he also had the idea to move the user tools above the wiki title). So, he already had an idea of what that task was about, although he hadn’t used DokuWiki himself.</p>
<div id="attachment_580"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-4-clarence-second.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-580" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-4-clarence-second-300x214.png" alt="" title="Third design" width="300" height="214" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-580">This is the second and final rough design by Clarence Lee (October 2011).</p></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/MrClow/dokuwiki-template-2011/commit/1c2583d6e97f3220db6eb34b0cd5243369b5d41b">first iteration</a> in August 2011 was already okay, but we all (including Clarence) thought it’s lacking something. “We all” means the “template committee” we formed after we noticed that discussing things on the mailinglist wouldn’t get us very far. It resulted in too many opinion and not enough decisions. So we rather discussed things in a smaller team consisting of Andi, Clarence, me, Håkan Sandell and Michael Hamann. We communicated either via IRC, emails or Skype conference calls. Especially the screen sharing feature of Skype helps a lot if you’re not in the same room but need to discuss visual things.</p>
<p>After a few small design tries in between (which didn’t lead to any implementation), the second (and final) design iteration came along in October 2011 with which Clarence was really happy. It’s a bit weird how we all were a little reserved at first and needed to warm up to the new design. But the more we looked at it, the more we liked it. And it finally turned out to be the very first design with which we were all really happy! 🙂<br>
I started to implement it straight away and finished the main work in January 2012.</p>
<p>And this is how the final design looks:<br>
</p><div id="attachment_581"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-5-final.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-581" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-5-final-600x504.png" alt="" title="Implementation of third design" width="600" height="504" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-581">This is the implementation of the final design as finished by Anika Henke (January 2012).</p></div>
<p>One interesting problem we faced was that designing apparently doesn’t really work like coding in an OpenSource environment. Apart from not having a designated decision maker (our team of 4 was still too big for consistent decisions, therefore it often turned out to be “design by committee”), not being at the same place when discussing things also made things more complicated. Parts of that are probably some misunderstandings, e.g. Clarence was really worried because he thought we didn’t like the design. He even was quite surprised when I talked to him and told him that we were all really happy, because in the IRC chats that didn’t come through. (I guess it’s the human nature of first jumping to the little negative things, instead of praising first or at all. And it’s also the fact that he didn’t know our personalities and therefore couldn’t judge how we meant certain things. So, there’s a little reminder to communicate more and more verbosely and to be aware that others usually cannot read minds.) A great read regarding that subject in general is this discussion on Forrst about <a href="https://forrst.com/posts/Designers_how_do_we_get_you_guys_to_contribute-gVn">how to get designers to contribute to open source projects</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_582"><p><a href="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-6-final-mobile.png" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-oKy1fg85" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-582" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.selfthinker.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dokuwiki-template-6-final-mobile-300x502.png" alt="" title="Mobile design" width="300" height="502" rel="lightbox"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-582">We also finally optimized DokuWiki for mobile devices. It was about time, really!</p></div>
<p>While in corporate environments communication and understanding between designers and developers is already quite difficult, in the OpenSource community it hardly happens at all, because unfortunately there very rarely <strong>are</strong> any designers to communicate to.<br>
Most OpenSource projects get initiated by <strong>developers</strong>. And at the stage they get initiated it’s already very late to get a designer involved. Ideally design should start <strong>before</strong> the development and later happen alongside it. Another problem why designers rarely contribute to an OpenSource project directly, is because it would mean working with its <strong>code</strong>. And designers don’t usually code that much. This calls for someone acting as a bridge, willing to work with them, who understands both sides and can implement the designers’ ideas.</p>
<p>The one comment from the aforementioned discussion on Forrst which best sums up the dilemma: “Design is not democratic. Most open-source projects are.” Why does collaboration between designers and developers work better in a corporate environment then? It doesn’t really, but it has to! Because having a client (and a boss) makes it much less of a democracy and makes it just necessary to collaborate, otherwise there will be consequences.<br>
As OpenSource is often about doing things voluntarily, you’ll naturally walk away if things don’t work out.</p>
<p>Fortunately it has worked out in our case. 🙂 So, big thanks to Clarence for designing a template that works in several scenarios and looks great and professional, thanks to Andi for leading the decision making process and later on designing some smaller parts, thanks to Esther for doing the design groundwork, thanks to Håkan and Michitux for testing and feedback, and the biggest thanks go to myself for doing all the hard work. 😉</p>
<p><em>P.S.: If any words of this post sound familiar, I copied and adapted texts I had already written to the mailinglist on 5 Feb 2012 as “<a href="http://www.freelists.org/post/dokuwiki/Embrace-the-new-default-template">Embrace the new default template</a>” and use images I had already posted on imgur as “<a href="http://imgur.com/a/l75Oj">DokuWiki template design iterations</a>“.</em></p>

You send it a source feed and you get back a sink feed that has an entry for

          the late 1980s I was making paintings about computer games. In January 1991 I bought an Amiga computer and made a series of fictional 
          videogame stills using Deluxe Paint II. I photographed them straight 
          from the screen as there was no other way to output them that I knew 
          of apart from through a very primitive daisy wheel printer where they appeared as washed out dots. <p>
          
          The effect of the photographs perfectly reproduced the highly 
          pixellated, raised needlepoint effect of the Amiga screen image. Conceptually 
          this means of presentation was also appropriate in that it made it seem 
          like I had gone into a videogame arcade and photographed the games there, 
          lending authenticity to the fiction.</p></span><span color="#99cc33" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The first seven works on this page form a series titled, 'Q.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I’ll respond as someone who is very familiar with both htmx and Intercooler (the predecessor of htmx).</p>
<p>I would say htmx happens to very nicely support progressive enhancement, if that’s your goal. Take this description of the hx:boost attribute for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>hx-boost</code> attribute allows you to “boost” normal anchors and form tags to use AJAX instead. This has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nice fallback</a> that, if the user does not have javascript enabled, the site will continue to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But what really sets htmx apart</strong></em> imho, is that you get to update <em>parts</em> of the page dynamically, by just adding some html attributes! I.e. no JavaScript required.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there of course, it makes implementing many web app staples like lazy loading, type-ahead search, dependent selects, click-to-edit, etc. absolutely trivial to implement (here’s the list of examples: <a href="https://htmx.org/examples" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://htmx.org/examples</a>).</p>
<p>Then there’s event handling, animation transitions, websockets, sse … the list goes on … ALL through specifying some attributes on bog standard html elements!</p>
<p>The clue is in the name really: htm<strong>x</strong>… as in <em>extending</em> html. I like to think of it as extending the html spec to bring you everything we’ve come to expect from modern web app development, purely through html, css and your favorite back-end framework.</p>
<p>My personal intercooler/htmx journey began by wanting to “ajaxify” a rather large, traditional MVC, full-page-refresh app, without doing a complete rewrite (it’s a Playframework app, so essentially the Java-based equivalent of Rails).</p>
<p>It was trivially easy to start “sprinkling in” aka progressively enhancing the app, with no backend changes at all, just by adding a few attributes on the existing html elements.</p>
<p>Not long after that, we had transformed the entire app into what feels like any other SPA (not a single full page refresh in sight), complete with history (back-button) support, while it still being a bog standard MVC app, with server side templates being rendered to the frontend. This, as they say, was a MASSIVE win <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p>Bottom line: if you believe that simplicity beats the “sexy" complexity introduced by heavy JS frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, etc; if you’re a single developer/small team wanting to productively churn out simple, easy to understand code that doesn’t require a bunch of extra build steps; if you buy into philosophies like the idea behind Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js and yes some parts of Hotwire (<em>especially</em> the “html over the wire” part), then I suggest you at least try out htmx before you make a decision.</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet you won’t regret it <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>P.S. I Just saw that the guy who made both intercooler and htmx responded while I was writing this, by pretty much saying what I was trying to say, just much more succinctly <img src="https://sjc2.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/images/emoji/apple/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" alt=":joy:"></p>

You want objects. You want polymorphism. You want concurrency. You want garbage collection. Wait you don’t want GC? Okay, no worries, we won’t do that :P</p><p>If you’ve just joined the series at this stage, here’s a quick recap. We’re designing a Java-esque concurrent object-oriented programming language <em>Bolt</em>. We’ve gone through the compiler frontend, where we’ve done the parsing, type-checking and dataflow analysis. We’ve <a href="https://mukulrathi.co.uk/create-your-own-programming-language/lower-language-constructs-to-llvm/">desugared our language to get it ready for LLVM</a> - the main takeaway is that objects have been desugared to structs, and their methods desugared to functions.</p><p>Learn about LLVM and you’ll be the envy of your friends. Rust uses LLVM for its backend, so it must be cool. You’ll beat them on all those performance benchmarks, without having to hand-optimise your code or write machine assembly code. Shhhh, I won’t tell them.</p><h2 id="just-give-me-the-code"><a href="#just-give-me-the-code" aria-label="just give me the code permalink"></a>Just give me the code!</h2><p>All the code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt">Bolt compiler repository</a>.</p><p>The C++ class definitions for our desugared representation (we call this <em>Bolt IR</em>) can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/deserialise_ir">deserialise_ir</a> folder. The code for this post (the LLVM IR generation) can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/tree/master/src/llvm-backend/llvm_ir_codegen">llvm_ir_codegen</a> folder. The repo uses the Visitor design pattern and ample use of <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make memory management easier.</p><p>To cut through the boilerplate, to find out how to generate LLVM IR for a particular language expression, search for the <code>IRCodegenVisitor::codegen</code> method that takes in the corresponding <code>ExprIR</code> object. e.g. for if-else statements:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>Value </span><span>*</span><span>IRCodegenVisitor</span><span>::</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIfElseIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="understanding-llvm-ir"><a href="#understanding-llvm-ir" aria-label="understanding llvm ir permalink"></a>Understanding LLVM IR</h2><p>LLVM sits in the <strong>middle-end</strong> of our compiler, <em>after</em> we’ve desugared our language features, but <em>before</em> the backends that target specific machine architectures (x86, ARM etc.)</p><p>LLVM’s IR is pretty low-level, it can’t contain language features present in some languages but not others (e.g. classes are present in C++ but not C). If you’ve come across instruction sets before, LLVM IR is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer#:~:text=A%20reduced%20instruction%20set%20computer,instruction%20set%20computer%20(CISC).">RISC</a> instruction set.</p><p>The upshot of it is that LLVM IR looks like a more <em>readable</em> form of assembly. As LLVM IR is <strong>machine independent</strong>, we don’t need to worry about the number of registers, size of datatypes, calling conventions or other machine-specific details.</p><p>So instead of a fixed number of physical registers, in LLVM IR we have an unlimited set of <em>virtual</em> registers (labelled <code>%0</code>, <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, <code>%3</code>… we can write and read from. It’s the backend’s job to map from virtual to physical registers.</p><p>And rather than allocating specific sizes of datatypes, we retain <strong>types</strong> in LLVM IR. Again, the backend will take this type information and map it to the size of the datatype. LLVM has types for different sizes of <code>int</code>s and floats, e.g. <code>int32</code>, <code>int8</code>, <code>int1</code> etc. It also has derived types: like <strong>pointer</strong> types, <strong>array</strong> types, <strong>struct</strong> types, <strong>function</strong> types. To find out more, check out the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html">Type</a> documentation.</p><p>Now, built into LLVM are a set of optimisations we can run over the LLVM IR e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination">dead-code elimination</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">function inlining</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rco/vignettes/opt-common-subexpr.html">common subexpression elimination</a> etc. The details of these algorithms are irrelevant: LLVM implements them for us.</p><p>Our side of the bargain is that we write LLVM IR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static Single Assignment (SSA) form</a>, as SSA form makes life easier for optimisation writers. SSA form sounds fancy, but it just means we define variables before use and assign to variables <strong>only once</strong>. In SSA form, we cannot reassign to a variable, e.g. <code>x = x+1</code>; instead we assign to a fresh variable each time (<code>x2 = x1 + 1</code>).</p><p>So in short: LLVM IR looks like assembly with <strong>types</strong>, minus the messy machine-specific details. LLVM IR must be in SSA form, which makes it easier to optimise.

We’ll go through the key concepts, then introduce more of the API as we explore LLVM IR further.</p><p>LLVM defines a whole host of classes that map to the concepts we’ve talked about.</p><ul><li><code>Value</code></li><li><code>Module</code></li><li><code>Type</code></li><li><code>Function</code></li><li><code>BasicBlock</code></li><li><code>BranchInst</code>

Now you’ve seen the diagrams that define modules, functions and basic blocks, the relationship between their corresponding classes in the API falls out nicely. You can query a <code>Module</code> object to get a list of its <code>Function</code> objects, and query a <code>Function</code> to get the list of its <code>BasicBlock</code>s, and the other way round: you can query a <code>BasicBlock</code> to get its parent <code>Function</code> object.</p><p><code>Value</code> is the base class for any value computed by the program. This could be a function (<code>Function</code> subclasses <code>Value</code>), a basic block (<code>BasicBlock</code> also subclasses <code>Value</code>), an instruction, or the result of an intermediate computation.</p><p>Each of the expression <code>codegen</code> methods returns a <code>Value *</code>: the result of executing that expression. You can think of these <code>codegen</code> methods as generating the IR for that expression and the <code>Value *</code> representing the virtual register containing the expression’s result.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/llvm-backend/llvm_ir_codegen/ir_codegen_visitor.h#L64-L84"> <!-- -->ir_codegen_visitor.h</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIntegerIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprBooleanIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprIdentifierIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprConstructorIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprLetIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>virtual</span><span> Value </span><span>*</span><span>codegen</span><span>(</span><span>const</span><span> ExprAssignIR </span><span>&amp;</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span><span> override</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></div><p>How do we generate the IR for these expressions?

<p>Tesla has given a sneak preview of its 4680 cell production that will happen at Gigafactory Berlin in its latest recruitment <a href="#video">video</a> on LinkedIn. The video shows several tiny details of the production process that might be of interest to the competing automotive companies in addition to the potential employees.</p>



<p>Tesla unveiled the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 form factor cell</a> at the hallmark <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/battery-day/">Battery Day</a> this year. Tesla is already producing these cells at the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/11/tesla-fremont-factory-drone-video-shows-the-model-y-gigacast-machines-roadrunner-magic-cube/">pilot production plant (Magic Cube)</a> at the company’s Fremont factory. According to Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">presentation</a> at the Battery Day, Tesla is ramping up 4680 pilot production to 10 GWh annually. “Actual production plants will be more in the order of 200 GWh/year, maybe more,” he said.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The rate of construction and development at the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-berlin/">Tesla Gigafactory Berlin</a> suggests that this will be the first location for full scale 4680 cell production. This is the reason Tesla is inviting engineers to join Giga Berlin to experience the most advanced cell manufacturing on the planet as of now. Tesla wrote in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6747572977950437376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job description at LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>At Tesla, we build cars and factories from the ground up. Now we do the same for batteries.</p><cite>Tesla (TSLA)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, Tesla also <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/10/05/teslas-acquisition-of-a-battery-assembly-company-opens-new-horizons-in-germany/">acquired a sinking battery assembly company</a> in Germany, looks like the workforce acquisition from that factory is not enough to fill the jobs at Giga Berlin cell plant.</p>

<p>One genius idea behind the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 cell</a>‘s 80mm height is that it enables continuous motion cell manufacturing just like the bottle production at beverage companies. This speeds up cell production many folds compared to the current procedure currently in practice at the Gigafactory Nevada cell manufacturing facility.</p>



<p>A Reddit user who is himself a cell chemistry engineer expressed what he saw in the video in his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kjcc04/join_the_gigaberlin_4680_cell_team/ggwj0p3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comment</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>While you’re waiting, the opening shots appear to be showing the production of one of the electrodes on a roll-to-roll coating process (0:02). This electrode is then sandwiched (positive electrode, separator, negative electrode) and the sand, which is then spun into a cylindrical cell (0:05). These cells are then loaded into canisters which you can see later in the video.</p><p>They don’t show (or it isn’t clear to me) the injection of the electrolyte which (I think) normally happens after the cylinder is put into the canister. It’s possible they are injecting it in one of the shots and I can’t tell, they could be injecting it off-screen, or they could be using a newer solid-state or quasi-solid state electrolyte.</p><p>I’m more familiar with the fundamentals of individual cell chemistry, less with the manufacturing of commercial cells, so I may be off!</p></blockquote>



<p>We can see a  lot of robots working on the cell manufacturing lines in the above video, but Tesla still needs humans,  so you can apply here for cell manufacturing and innovation-related <a href="https://www.tesla.com/battery-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs here</a>.</p>

<p>“This is cool, really cool, but I feel like maybe you need an intervention” – Friend’s reaction when I showed them this.</p>

<h2>What have I done?</h2>
<p>Using only Google Sheets formulas I’ve made a digital clock. It updates every minute, it’s a clock, that’s pretty much it.</p>
<h2>Why have I done it?</h2>
<p><strong>I’m a very strong believer in getting the most out of the tools available to us and this kind of rubbish is a great way to learn things which are </strong><em><strong>way</strong></em><strong> more useful elsewhere</strong>!</p>
<p>Without doing anything like custom functions in JavaScript – Google Sheets is <em>amazingly </em>flexible. I’ve used it to automate things like <a href="https://moz.com/blog/visualising-time-using-google-sheets">project management tasks</a> and even <a href="https://www.distilled.net/resources/screaming-frog-and-google-sheets/">website change detection using Screaming Frog</a>. </p>
<p>Google Sheets is also <em>really</em> accessible – if you make something in Google Sheets you can share it with colleagues and clients without them needing to install anything, without them needing an account, and without them being made nervous by any mention of code.</p>
<p>Languages like Python and JavaScript are great ways to get things done but it is fun to see what we can achieve with little ole Sheets.</p>
<h2>The sheet</h2>
<p>Access the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_EjJsdfzLL6LaTtJnTZ26BzHRHBDJy1paHeeZ87toT0/copy">Google Sheets digital clock here</a> if you want to have a play with it. I’ve set the link to automatically copy so you have your own version where you can see the formulas at work.</p>

<h2>How have I done it? (The important bit!)</h2>
<p>As I say – the value of these things is what we are able to learn. So let’s see what we’ve learned.</p>
<h3>1. Getting the current time – now()</h3>
<p><em>=now()</em> returns current date and time in this format: <strong><em>24/10/2020 23:24:00</em></strong></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.12.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.12.png" alt="" data-src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.12.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></picture></figure>
<p>We’ll put that in cell A1.</p>
<h3>2. Getting minutes and hours – hour() and minute()</h3>
<p><em>=hour(A1)</em> will give us the hour contained in a specific time. If we used hour() on the timestamp above we would get <em><strong>23</strong></em></p>
<p><em>=minute(A1)</em> gives us the minute. If we used minute() on the timestamp above we’d get <strong><em>24</em></strong></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.06.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.06.png" alt="" data-src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.24.06.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></picture></figure>
<h3>3. Splitting minutes and hours into individual digits – regexextract()</h3>
<p>=regexextract() lets us get part of the value out of a cell, but only as long as it’s used on text (digits can be interpreted as either numbers or text in Sheets). So <span>first</span> we use =text(hour(A1),”##”) – that takes the hour from the timestamp and turn it into text.</p>
<p>You may notice below that the hour and minute values are left-aligned rather than right-aligned. That’s one way to spot whether Sheets might be treating digits as a number or as text.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.27.16.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.27.16.png" alt="" data-src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-24-at-23.27.16.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></picture></figure>
<p>Then we use =regexextract() to get the first number of the hour like so <em>=regexextract(text(HOUR(A1),”##”),”^\d”)</em>. Don’t worry too much about that RegEx, all it means is “the first digit”. If you want to learn more about RegEx – check out my <a href="https://www.therobinlord.com/projects/slash-escape">RegEx learning game – Slash Escape</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll extract the last number of the hour like this; <em>=regexextract(text(HOUR(A1),”##”),”\d$”)</em></p>
<p>Then we do the same for both of the minute digits.</p>

<h3>3. Changing colours – Sheets conditional formatting</h3>
<p>To create our digital clock, we need to tell sheets which cells to highlight at which time. To do that we’ll use Sheets’ amazingly flexible conditional formatting.</p>
<p>We’ll apply a different conditional format to each space in our clock. To make it clearer – here’s each of them highlighted in a different colour.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45.png.webp 464w, https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45-300x184.png.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" type="image/webp"><img alt="" data-srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45.png 464w, https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45-300x184.png 300w" data-src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" srcset="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45.png 464w, https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45-300x184.png 300w" src="https://www.therobinlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-25-at-11.06.45.png"></picture></figure>
<p>We have four rules, one for each digit in our clock. Each splits out a portion of the time for our display. Our broad process is;</p>
<ul><li>The rule defining the green number above<ul><li>When the first digit of the hour is 1 – highlight all the cells in the first block which we’ve marked as “1 cells”</li><li>When the first digit of the hour is 8 – highlight all the cells in the first block which we’ve marked as “8 cells”<br></li></ul></li><li>The rule defining the blue number above<ul><li>When the first digit of the minute is 6 – highlight all the cells in the last block which we’ve marked as “6 cells”</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>etc. etc. etc.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Our first, green digit, at maximum will occupy any of the cells between C3 and H14.</p>
<p>In each of the cells in that range, we’ve written out a RegEx which tells us if a digit will use that cell.</p>
<p>For example, cell C3 will be highlighted if we are creating the digits 4, 5 or 7. It won’t be highlighted if we’re creating the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, or 9. So in C3 we have written<em> ^(4|5|7)$</em> which means “match 4, 5, or 7, exactly – nothing else.</p>
<p>In this case – U1 is where we’ve put our first extracted digit of the hour. So the custom formula written there means “when the first digit of the hour matches 4, 5, or 7, highlight C3”. </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One smart thing about custom formulas in Google Sheets is, if you apply it to a range of cells (like C3:H14) it will take relative and absolute cell references into account. In our formula we’ve used $U$1 – that’s an absolute cell reference – no matter where we are applying this custom formula – that part will always refer to U1. However – we haven’t written $C$3 – we’ve just written C3. So, in the first cell of our range, we’ll refer to C3 but if we apply this formula to a cell one row down it’ll refer to C4, if we then move one column across it’ll refer to D4.</p>
<p>This is how we create our clock without having to write out a different conditional formula for each one. When the conditional formatting is applied to C4, it’ll check whether the regex in C4 matches the first digit of the hour. The regex in C4 is <em>^(2|3|4|5|6|8|9|0)$</em> so if the first digit of the hour is 2 – C4 will be highlighted and C3 won’t be.</p>
<h3>4. Drawing all the numbers – join()</h3>
<p>It would be a massive pain to just try to write out all of these regex formulas one-by-one. Instead we’ll write out each of the possible digits we want to represent and then combine them into our regex.</p>

<p>Our Clock C3 cell in our is a combination of the numbers in our digits sheet <em>A3, G3, M3, S3, Y3, AE3, AK3, AQ3, AW3, BC3</em>. Clock C4 is <em>A4, G4, M4</em> etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>The formula we use to do that is; <em>JOIN(“|”,Digits!A3,Digits!G3,Digits!M3,Digits!S3,Digits!Y3,Digits!AE3,Digits!AK3,Digits!AQ3,Digits!AW3,Digits!BC3)</em></p>
<p>Basically – take the value from each of these cells and join them together with a pipe | in between them (because pipe in regex means <strong>or</strong>).</p>
<h3>5. Removing errant pipes – regexreplace()</h3>
<p>The problem with this is we have some empty cells so we can end up with a regex that reads <em>|||4|5||7||| </em> – having those empty spaces means we won’t just match numbers – we’ll match a lack of number too, which could screw up our clock. To get rid of those problematic extra bits we’ll use regex <em>on</em> our regex. </p>

<p><em>=regexreplace(JOIN(…),”\|{2,}”,”|”)</em></p>
<p>This formula will take the result of our join, identify anything that matches <strong>\|{2,}</strong> (basically two or more pipes in the row) and replaces them with | – one pipe.</p>
<p>We also don’t want to end up with pipes at the start or end like this; |4|5| so we’ll regexreplace on our regexreplace</p>

<p><em>=regexreplace(regexreplace(…),”(^\||\|$)”,””))</em></p>
<p>This formula will look at the result of our last regexreplace(), find anything that matches <strong>^\|</strong> (a pipe at the start of the text) or <strong>\|$</strong> (a pipe at the end of the text) and replace either with “” (nothing).</p>
<p>So now we have a regex like this; <strong>4|5</strong></p>
<h2>5. Complete our regex – &amp; concatenation</h2>
<p>To make sure we have a nice, specific, regex to match on we can add some text to the start and end. Google Sheets has a concatenate function but I find using &amp; easier to read</p>
<p>=”^(“&amp;regexreplace(…)&amp;”)$”</p>
<p>That formula will take our cleaned up regex, add brakcets and a “start’ and “end” symbol so we have something like this; <strong>^(</strong>4|5)$</p>
<p>We know that regex will only match either the digit 4 or the digit 5 and nothing else. Nice and specific.</p>
<h3>6. Create all the rest of our digits – arrayformula()</h3>
<p>At this point we’ve created the template for our first hour digit. We don’t want to go through all of that for each of the other templates and they can all be identical. So we use arrayformula to copy one block of cells to another place.</p>
<p><em>=arrayformula($C$3:$H$14) </em>duplicates our template, we can do that for each of our other digits.</p>
<h3>7. Highlighting the rest of our digits – Sheets conditional formatting</h3>

<p>Our first conditional formatting formula checked each cell in the green block against the first digit of the current hour. Our second formula checks the cells in the yellow block against the second digit of the hour, our third block checks the cells in the blue block against the first digit of the minute etc. etc.</p>

<h2>Any ideas?</h2>
<p>As above – feel free to play around with the Google Sheet and see how it works.</p>

<p>This is a bit of fun which hopefully helps you learn some Sheets tricks that’ll be valuable elsewhere. One thing I love about open platforms like sheets is there are <em>loads</em> of people creating this kind of thing. When I started to share this, a colleague pointed out that <a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-formula-clock/">Ben Collins actually created a working </a><em><a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-formula-clock/">analogue</a></em><a href="https://www.benlcollins.com/spreadsheets/google-sheets-formula-clock/"> clock using Sheets sparkline formulas, which is very impressive.</a></p>
<p>Have you seen any cool sheets projects recently? Anything you think I could have done better here? Tweet me @robinlord8 </p>

<h2>Roughly 500 employees failed the test, which claimed they would receive a $650 bonus.</h2>



<p>“2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!” the email read.</p>



<p>Sent by Happyholiday@Godaddy.com, tucked underneath a glittering banner of a snowflake and stamped with the words “GoDaddy Holiday Party,” the Dec. 14 email to hundreds of GoDaddy employees promised some welcome financial relief during an <a href="https://coppercourier.com/story/tens-of-millions-of-americans-face-economic-ruin-unless-congress-gets-its-sht-together/">otherwise stressful year</a>.</p>



<p>“Though we cannot celebrate together during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a $650 one-time Holiday bonus!” the email read. “To ensure that you receive your one-time bonus in time for the Holidays, please select your location and fill in the details by Friday, December 18th.”</p>



<p>But, two days later, the company sent another email.</p>



<p>“You’re getting this email because you failed our recent phishing test,” the company’s chief security officer Demetrius Comes<strong> </strong>wrote. “You will need to retake the Security Awareness Social Engineering training.”</p>

	</figure>



<p>Phishing tests are sent by companies to gauge their employees’ susceptibility to phishing attacks, where people outside the company will attempt to disguise themselves as trusted sources to gain access to sensitive information, like usernames and passwords.</p>



<p>The follow-up email from Comes said that roughly 500 GoDaddy employees clicked on the holiday bonus email and “failed the test.”</p>



<p>Scottsdale-based GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar and web-hosting company, did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the emails. The emails were forwarded to The Copper Courier by three GoDaddy employees.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/05/05/godaddy-confirms-data-breach-what-19-million-customers-need-to-know/?sh=235bf0a91daa">Forbes reported</a> that 28,000 GoDaddy customers were impacted after a data breach compromised their account usernames and passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the company <a href="https://investors.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Reports-Second-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx">surpassing 20 million customers this year</a> and reporting “record customer growth,” the company <a href="https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/news-releases/press-release-details/2020/GoDaddy-Blog-Update/default.aspx">laid off or reassigned</a> hundreds of employees during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/business/godaddy-to-lay-off-hundreds-close-texas-offices">including in Arizona</a>, Iowa, and Texas.</p>



<p>GoDaddy is not the first company this year to trick employees into falling for phishing scams by dangling the carrot of a potential bonus.</p>



<p>In September, Tribune Publishing, which owns <a href="https://www.tribpub.com/#">several major newspapers</a> around the country, sent a similar email to its employees.</p>



<p>The email, circulated by <a href="https://twitter.com/justin_fenton/status/1308851669397053440">several furious Tribune employees on Twitter</a>, said the company was giving out targeted bonuses of $5,000-$10,000, only to later reveal itself as a phishing test sent by the company.</p>



<figure><div>
<figure><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've been able to confirm that this was in fact! an internal test from <a href="https://twitter.com/tribpub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tribpub</a>. If you click the links, you get a message from the company's training contractor saying you clicked on a simulated phishing test.</p><p>The level of cruelty is actually stunning, even for this company.</p></div>— Danielle Ohl (@DTOhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote></figure>
</div></figure>



<p>“The level of cruelty is actually stunning,” Tribune reporter Danielle Ohl <a href="https://twitter.com/DTOhl/status/1308850196978298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308850196978298880%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fy3z8g5%2Ftribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">wrote at the time</a>.</p>



<p>A Tribune spokesperson <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3z8g5/tribune-publishing-out-evils-itself-with-phishing-email-promising-bonuses">later told Vice News</a> that the exercise was part of a regular, internal test to assess phishing risks and said that it had no intention of offending its employees. “In retrospect, the topic of the email was misleading and insensitive, and the company apologizes for its use,” the statement read.</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a> because sometimes you need to see the waterfall to want to take the hike.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were all object-oriented programmers at one point in time — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assimilation of functional semantics with any regular conception of the physical world is no easy task. Look again around the room, bus or park and you will likely still identify distinct objects that may change over time. I kicked around chapter 3 of <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> for over a year before wrapping my head around it. That we may still be experiencing disbelief at the thought of a new model for time suggests a larger game at play.</p>
<p>Dominant scientific paradigms pervade our language, on the one hand, and way of thinking, on the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientific practice always involves the production and the explanation of generalizations about nature; those activities presuppose a language with some minimal richness; and the acquisition of such a language brings knowledge of nature with it. When the exhibit of examples is part of the process of learning terms like “motion,” ‘‘cell,‘‘ or ‘‘energy element,’’ what is acquired is knowledge of language and of the world together. <strong>On the one hand</strong>, the student learns what these terms mean, what features are relevant to attaching them to nature, what things cannot be said of them on pain of self-contradiction, and so on. <strong>On the other hand</strong>, the student learns what categories of things populate the world, what their salient features are, and something about the behavior that is and is not permitted to them. In much of language learning these two sorts of knowledge — <strong>knowledge of words and knowledge of nature</strong> — are acquired together, not really two sorts of knowledge at all, but two faces of the single coinage that a language provides. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, a new discovery “that cannot be accommodated within the concepts in use before” may elicit surprise or even disbelief. “One cannot get from the old to the new simply by an addition to what was already known. Nor can one quite describe the new in the vocabulary of the old or vice versa.” (<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">Thomas Kuhn</a>) Rather, in order to “make or to assimilate such a discovery one must alter the way one thinks about and describes some range of natural phenomena”; even the articulation of an observation that runs counter to the dominant paradigm can only be “formulated by altering the language with which nature [is] described.” (<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">Thomas Kuhn</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the compound sentence, “In the Ptolemaic system planets revolve about the earth; in the Copernican they revolve about the sun.” Strictly construed, that sentence is incoherent. The first occurrence of the term “planet” is Ptolemaic, the second Copernican, and the two attach to nature differently. For no univocal reading of the term “planet” is the compound sentence true. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, object-orientation pervades our language, on the one hand. That “objects change as time elapses” is a statement of obvious fact betrays the object-oriented presumption embedded in our language. “Object” (and “identity”), “change” (and “state”), and “time” work together to describe a coherent <em>object-oriented</em> view. On the other hand, objects orient our perception of our own physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are part. — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look again around the room, bus, park or wherever you find yourself reading this sentence, and you will likely identify “a collection of distinct objects,” such as dogs, people, and trees, “whose behaviors may change over time.”</p>
<p>Yet, the behavior of a functional program cannot be described in terms that attribute change to the enduring identity of objects as time elapses. And because of the dominance of object-orientation as reflected in the presumptions of our natural language, we cannot so much as describe the semantics of a functional program except through altering our language and reconstituting our physical reality. Meaningful “identity” must disappear in favor of change itself. “State” must describe the result of change instead of an object quality. “Time” must describe discrete state changes rather than any continuous dynamicness attributable to all objects.</p>
<p>No wonder the functional model may still elicit disbelief. <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">This essay</a> can be seen as an uphill climb against the gravity of a dominant paradigm; the functional view is perhaps expressible now, but only because of <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">the arduous work put in above</a>. Our natural language is not so easily distorted, violated and repurposed and our thought patterns are comorbid with our language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until those changes had occurred, language itself resisted the invention and introduction of the sought after new theories. The same resistance by language is, I take it, the reason for Planck’s switch from ‘‘element’’ and ‘‘resonator’’ to ‘‘quantum’’ and ‘‘oscillator.’’ Violation or distortion of a previously unproblematic scientific language is the touchstone for revolutionary change. — Thomas Kuhn, <a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hsci161/Sci._Rev._Reader/12_S6_Kuhn.pdf">What are Scientific Revolutions?</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, teaching functional programming to anyone is like teaching Copernican astronomy to a Ptolemaic astronomer or quantum mechanics to a Newtonian physicist. We lack the basic language to articulate the underlying concepts. Worse still, the language we do have is endemic to a conflicting paradigm. Perhaps the disparity between the efficacy<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> and popularity<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> of functional programming languages is best explained in this light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it — Max Plank, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed027p288.1">autobiography</a>, quoted by Thomas Kuhn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the functional view is indeed expressible as a result of the <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time">work put in above</a>. We can see change as creating something new, instead of altering something of old, and time as a series of successive states. We can alter our language and reimagine our physical reality to support a functional view of change, state and time.</p>
<hr>
<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>There are many advantages to functional programming. Programs that deal with mutation are “drastically more difficult” to reason about than ones that do not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Referential transparency is violated when we include set! [i.e. assignment operations] in our computer language. This makes it tricky to determine when we can simplify expressions by substituting equivalent expressions. Consequently, reasoning about programs that use assignment becomes drastically more difficult — SICP Section 3.1.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, functions avoid <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/08/temporal-coupling-between-method-calls.html">temporal coupling</a> since there is no time,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, programming with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that have been changed. This issue simply does not arise in functional programs. — SICP Section 3.1.3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and dramatically reduce debugging and unit testing complexity since there is no meaningful context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And that is the problem with places. You have this sort of global state that you have to reproduce in order to debug a field problem. That is very very tough.” Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reified state couches in writing what must otherwise live in a programmer’s heads — each member of a team can read a function signature instead of building up (hopefully) the same working memory for each object. Couching state in language makes it accessible to static language analysis tools. <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/07/01/yes-silver-bullet/#bd2d47d8dac2401e936ca7902bc9109d">A compiler may exhaustively permute the set of application states</a> without actually running manually-written (exhaust<em>ing</em>) unit tests. Functional programs are more easily parallelized since they are just functions with no internal model for time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the complexities introduced by assignment become even more problematic in the presence of concurrency. — SICP Section 3.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These advantages have been known for decades. John Backus “gave high visibility to functional programming” (SICP Section 3.5.5; also see Simon Peyton-Jones, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re96UgMk6GQ">Escape from the ivory tower: the Haskel journey</a>) through his <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Turing Award lecture</a> in 1978, seven years before the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and thirteen before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a>. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>There is no shortage of questionable products to connect you and your home to the internet.</p>

<p>Each brings another sketchy WiFi device connected to your network, and another set of microphones, each listening in your home for their special trigger word.</p>

<p>Rather than invite more digital strangers into our home, it feels more appropriate to keep a personal garden of digital things we’ve made.</p>

<p>In today’s post, we’ll build a tiny web application (and iPhone / Android app!) to control Christmas lights that only works when you’re home, and connected to your home network.</p>



<p><img src="https://kpkaiser.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/react-native-christmas1.png" alt="React Native Christmas Lights"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3hezYGq">Jetson Nano</a> is my favorite platforms for building localized internet of things projects.</p>

<p>It’s an ARM64 device, with four built in USB ports, and was designed to do machine learning at the edge.</p>

<p>We’ll use it as a server for a <a href="https://amzn.to/3pmSe3c">Z-Wave USB Stick</a>. Z-Wave is a protocol that exists to do home automation. Importantly for us, it operates separately from your WiFi.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve hooked it up to 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgyxHt">outdoor light switches</a>, to turn on and off my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>The light switches come in a waterproof shielding, with a single manual button on them. You can press the button to enable pair mode, and also to manually turn the lights on and off.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the React Native app running on my iPhone.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn’t attempt to build an iPhone app for such a small project.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> has made running code on your phone a great experience. They automatically build and push to your phone via an app and the command line.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-api-for-your-christmas-lights">Building an API for Your Christmas Lights</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll want to do is check to make sure we’ve got the Z-Wave stick installed and running on our USB drive in the Jetson Nano.</p>

<p>Every time I work with Z-Wave, I forget details of how the Z-Wave network model works. Because of this, I like to open up an IPython session, and start playing around with the network:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>openzwave</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.option</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span>
<span>from</span> <span>openzwave.network</span> <span>import</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span>

<span># make sure these Z-wave commands get flushed with a time.sleep</span>
<span># also, /dev/ttyACM0 is the name of my USB port for the Z-Stick</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveOption</span><span>(</span><span>'/dev/ttyACM0'</span><span>)</span>
<span>options</span><span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>()</span>

<span>network</span> <span>=</span> <span>ZWaveNetwork</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span># the next two lines start an IPython session in line</span>
<span>import</span> <span>IPython</span>
<span>IPython</span><span>.</span><span>embed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here, I start to remember how things work, and see that <code>list(network.nodes.keys())</code> gives me a list of the <code>nodes</code> connected to the Z-Wave network. Because I’m in IPython, I can also tab through each object to see the functions available.</p>

<p>But how do you know what capabilities each Z-Wave node has?</p>

<p>Some Z-Wave devices have multiple switches built into them, each potentially with their own dimmer. To grab switches, we need to do a <code>list(network.nodes[node].get_switches.keys())</code>.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we can then set state on each node with a <code>set_switch</code> function call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
<span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
    <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>False</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that I know how to effect change, I can build an API in Flask to serve up changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@app.route</span><span>(</span><span>'/state'</span><span>,</span> <span>methods</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>method</span> <span>==</span> <span>'GET'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
        <span>ON</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>node</span> <span>in</span> <span>node_list</span><span>:</span>
            <span>switches</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switches</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
                <span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>get_switch_state</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
                <span>if</span> <span>state</span><span>:</span>
                    <span>ON</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
                    <span>continue</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>ON</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>({</span><span>'state'</span><span>:</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>})</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>({</span><span>'state'</span><span>:</span> <span>'OFF'</span><span>})</span>
    
    <span>change</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>json</span>

    <span>node_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>switches</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>change</span><span>[</span><span>'state'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'ON'</span><span>:</span>
                <span>network</span><span>.</span><span>nodes</span><span>[</span><span>node</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>set_switch</span><span>(</span><span>switches</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>jsonify</span><span>(</span><span>change</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve added a <code>time.sleep</code>, because it can take a bit for the Z-Wave network to propagate state. Two seconds is probably too long to sleep for, but hey, it works, and I’m not in a hurry.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-react-native-app-with-expo">Building a React Native App with Expo</h2>

<p>Again, building an app is usually too much work for such a small project. But it had been a while since I’d built an app, and I kept hearing about React Native, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>I was surprised to be able to have a built version of my app on my phone in under an hour. There’s a new platform called Expo, which handles all of the heavy lifting usually associated with deploying an iPhone app.</p>

<p>Indeed, because my “app” was so small (literally a single button and a single state of <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>), I really didn’t have much to do beyond the basic, example app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>useState</span><span>,</span> <span>useEffect</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span>

<p>Here, you can see the call to my Flask app’s API, on my local area network. I’ve set a static IP address for my Jetson Nano, and am running a Flask server on a non-standard port, <code>8050</code>. I did this because I have other Flask apps running on my Nano.</p>

<p>When the app is opened, a <code>GET</code> request is made to the <code>/state</code> resource. It returns a JSON object, with the current state of the Z-Wave switches. If one is on, the network is considered <code>ON</code>.</p>

<p>From here, we can press a single button, to flip the state. This makes a <code>POST</code> request to the <code>/state</code> resource, with the desired new state.</p>

<p>I can build the app from my terminal to the Expo App on my phone via an <code>expo build:ios</code>. Once that’s done, I can open up the Expo app and control my Christmas lights.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished!</p>

<h2 id="alright-im-sold-wheres-the-code">Alright I’m sold, where’s the code?</h2>

<p><img src="https://makeartwithpython.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/christmas-lights.gif" alt="Pressing the button"></p>

<p>All of the code is open source, and lives on <a href="https://github.com/burningion/minimum-viable-christmas-lights">Github</a>. I didn’t mention it, but there’s also a view in the Flask app you can visit in the browser to control the lights too. You can see it at the <code>/</code> url.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your app look better than mine, and share the results.</p>

<p>Happy holidays!</p>

December 24, 2020 | https://jeremybasso.dev/5-emerging-languages-and-frameworks-to-watch-in-2021 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeremybasso.dev/5-emerging-languages-and-frameworks-to-watch-in-2021">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>2020 has been an awesome year for developers, and we can expect 2021 to be the same. This is why I decided to share with you some of the languages and frameworks I expect to take over the world in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="deno">Deno</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608822461114/qkKraPGRu.png?auto=compress" alt="deno.png"></p>
<p>Deno is a runtime for Javascript launched this year. It has lived a fair amount of attention since the creator of Deno is known to be the creator of Node.js. One of the focuses of Deno is to rise where Node.js has difficulties. </p>
<p>Deno is completely written in Rust, using the V8 engine, and shows some impressive performance insights. </p>
<p>Here are some awesome pointers for Deno:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure by default: security is ensured by the runtime until you make some breaking changes</li>
<li>TypeScript support</li>
<li>Ships executable file</li>
<li>URL-based dependency management (no more npm or yarn)</li>
<li>very cool logo (I like dinosaurs)</li>
</ul>
<p>For all those reasons, the rise of Deno may be something to notice in 2021, and we can expect Deno to steal some light from Node.js in the future.</p>
<h2 id="kotlin">Kotlin</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608823329851/UC0BFqhX3.png?auto=compress" alt="kotlin_+.png"></p>
<p>Kotlin is a JVM-based language launched in 2017 by the fantastic company JetBrains. The idea is to keep concepts from Java while eliminating boiler-plates and improving the developer experience.</p>
<p>An interesting point is that Kotlin and Java are interoperable, meaning you can add Kotlin to your Java project, or Java to your Kotlin project (why would you do that ?).</p>
<p>Kotlin kept rising inside the Android ecosystem, becoming a supported language with Java and is now the main language for Android developers.</p>
<p>I have been using Kotlin for backend development for some years now, and I can ensure that the language is mature and I had a great developer experience. If you come from Java, there are high chances you will never go back to Java again after trying Kotlin.</p>
<p>Also, Kotlin Multi-Platform is a project to use Kotlin as a language for multi-platform development (iOS, Android, Web). While still being at an early stage, the project saw some great companies such as Netflix or VMWare give a try to Kotlin MP, which a sign of great potential.</p>
<p>Kotlin will keep rising in 2021, and you can expect it to take over the JVM-based languages.</p>
<h2 id="flutter">Flutter</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608824604977/w1ts7oclN.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="flutter-banner.jpg"></p>
<p>Flutter is an open-source SDK allowing users to develop mobile applications using only one codebase written in Dart. It was created by Google in 2015 and </p>
<p>Over the years, a lot of frameworks were created to avoid writing code for Android and for iOS by using one codebase instead: Xamarin, Ionic, Cordova, React Native ...
If you tried some of them, you may have seen some issues such as performances, or specific bugs on specific devices.</p>
<p>Flutter, even though it is not perfect, manages to solve some of those issues. </p>
<p>By using an ahead-of-time compilation, meaning before the execution, Flutter ensures high performances on devices. Maintaining a high FPS rate is not something rare in Flutter while being impossible in React Native as an example.</p>
<p>Also, Flutter is working at a very low level using C++ based libraries. Flutter directly writes on the screen using the Skia graphic library, thus maintaining performance.</p>
<p>In terms of developer experience, I suggest you all give it a try. With Flutter, you can create your UIs programmatically, enjoy features such as dev tools, or hot reload, which is really refreshing.</p>
<p>Flutter already some great app references, such as The New York Times, Tencent, or the Google Assistant, showing huge maturity.</p>
<p>We can expect Flutter to take over the multi-platform mobile development in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608825320545/pnRY3DYsd.png?auto=compress" alt="rust.png">
Rust is an open-source language created by Mozilla in 2010 and launched 1.0 in 2015.</p>
<p>The goal of Rust from the beginning is to be efficient, secure, and performing. The language kept improving for some years now, using the contributions of the community to build the roadmap.</p>
<p>Rust is now in a very good state, putting Rust as one of the best languages in terms of pure performance, making great use of concepts such as functional programming and concurrency. Rust is often mentioned as the successor of C and C++.</p>
<p>We can expect Rust to keep rising in 2021, and become one of the top languages.</p>
<h2 id="solidity">Solidity</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608826038695/ZJ4YVlCfc.png?auto=compress" alt="solidity.png"></p>
<p>Solidity is a language created in 2014 by the Ethereum Solidity team.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with blockchain, chances are high that you never heard about Solidity.</p>
<p>Solidity is an object-oriented language, mainly designed to write blockchain smart contracts. It is a leader from the start because it is one of the main languages for the Ethereum implementation, which is one of the top crypto-currencies currently (number two). </p>
<p>Some private blockchains are using Solidity as well, such as HyperLedger.</p>
<p>With the rise of ICO as a funding tool for crypto-currencies, Solidity developers became an essential resource. Indeed, for an Initial Coin Offering, you will need to write (at least on paper) implementation of your future currency, involving tech experts in the matter. </p>
<p>We can expect Solidity to keep rising in the developers market in 2021, with growth tied to the blockchain environment growth.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Deno, Flutter, Kotlin, Rust, and Solidity, we have 5 strong contenders for the most high-potential languages and frameworks in 2021!</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you think of some others!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading !</strong></p>

Such methods are known as <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/influxdb-and-the-raft-consensus-protocol/"><em>Distributed Consensus</em> protocols</a>. In particular Raft generates a log of <em>commands</em>, which records all changes that have taken place, and which all computers agree on. In rqlite, SQLite statements are stored in these commands and written durably to disk, <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DESIGN.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before being applied to the SQLite database.</a></p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>There were a few reasons for the change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce disk usage. Protobuf encoding is more efficient than JSON, so every addition to the Raft log now means less bytes written to disk — often a lot less.</li>
<li>More easily support compression. rqlite supports batching SQLite requests, as well as arbitrarily long SQLite statements, so requests can often benefit from compression. This again means fewer bytes need to be written to disk. While JSON can also be compressed, Protobufs offers more sophisticated data modeling, making it a little easier to mark when a log entry has been compressed (which is necessary for robust decoding of that data later on).</li>
<li>Try to increase rqlite performance, due to the reduced disk load.</li>
<li>More sophisticated data modeling, to help with future development and maintenance of the core data models. Because these data models must be serialized to disk, backwards compatibility is important. Protocol Buffers makes that easier.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially</strong> form the basis of a <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gRPC</a> API in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>This was the first time I introduced Protobufs into any of <a href="https://github.com/otoolep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my open-source projects</a>, and it was pretty straightforward. The data modeling went through a few iterations, but was also pretty easy. In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.7.0/command/command.proto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Protobuf types</a> are now used throughout the code base, and allowed me to remove many other types&nbsp; – previously each layer of code defined its own types. While this latter approach had its advantages — clear separation of each module for example — it did result in a fair amount of data copying, as each layer had to first <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.6.0/store/store.go#L1125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transform data into another slightly different data model</a> before calling the next layer.</p>
<p>Initially I also coded top-down — adding the new types in the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.7.0/http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP serving layer</a>, followed by the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.7.0/store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Store layer</a>. This quickly became awkward and slow, and wasn’t a good guide to the ongoing Protobuf data modeling either. Development proceeded much better when I abandoned the top down approach, and started adding the data models from the bottom up — starting with the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.7.0/db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DB layer</a>, then moving to the Store layer, and finishing with the HTTP layer.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall I am happy with the new code and the use of Protobufs, but the rqlite codebase is beginning to grow in complexity. A major goal for rqlite has always been a clean design and implementation. Protobufs are definitely more complex than simple JSON, and therefore the codebase is now more complicated. However the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.7.0/command/command.pb.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generated Go support</a> for Protobufs shouldn’t need much maintenance going forward, so hopefully the day-to-day development complexity remains low.</p>
<p>The performance improvements have been disappointing however, and I’ve seen only marginal improvements in write throughput. Basic testing shows that performance has increased for some workloads by about 10%. Because the underlying Raft system calls <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fsync</a> after each disk write,&nbsp; it’s the real performance bottleneck. And that call can’t be avoided, not without risking data loss.</p>
<p>However for highly compressible requests, disk usage has gone way down, and that’s a big win. And even for small SQL statements which are not compressed, Protobuf encoding still saves significant space. Smaller SQL commands take up about 50% less disk space when encoded.</p>
<p>5.7.0 can also <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.7.0/command/legacy/command.go#L57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read log entries encoded in older versions</a>, so it’s fully backwards-compatible with earlier releases in the 5.x series.</p>
<p>So if you’ve been using rqlite for large SQL statements, or use batching, be sure to check out release 5.7.0. You can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases page</a>.</p>

	<p><small>December 24, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In Python, in theory all types descend from <code>object</code> (they are
direct or indirect subclasses of it). For years, I've believed (and
written) that this was not the case at the implementation level for
types written in native C code in CPython (the standard implementation
of Python and the one you're probably using). Types written in C
might behave as if they descended from <code>object</code>, but I thought their
behavior was actually entirely stand-alone, implemented by each
type separately in C. Courtesy of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">Python behind the scenes #6:
how Python object system works</a>,
I've discovered that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>In CPython, C level Python types are not literally subclasses of
the C level version of <code>object</code>, because of course C doesn't have
classes and subclasses in that sense. Instead, you usually describe
your type by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html"><code>PyTypeObject</code></a> struct for it, with
all sorts of fields that you fill in or don't fill in as you need
them, including a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_base"><code>tp_base</code></a> field
for your base type (if you want more than one base type, you need
to take the alternate path of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#heap-types">heap type</a>). When
CPython needs to execute special methods or other operations on
your type, it will directly use fields on your <code>PyTypeObject</code>
structure (and as far as I know, it only uses those fields, with
no fallbacks). On the surface, this looks like the <code>tp_base</code> field
is essentially decorative and is only used to report your claimed
<code>__base__</code> if people ask.</p>

<p>However, there is a bit of CPython magic hiding behind the scenes.
In order to actually use a <code>PyTypeObject</code> as a type, you must
register it and make it ready by calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_Ready"><code>PyType_Ready</code></a>. As part
of this, <code>PyType_Ready</code> will use your type's <code>tp_base</code> to fill
in various fields of your <code>PyTypeObject</code> if you didn't already do
that, which effectively means that your C level type will inherit
those fields from its base type (and so on all the way up to
<code>object</code>). This is outlined in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#cols">a section of the C API</a>, but of course
I never read the C API myself because I never needed to use it.
The <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">how [the] Python object system works</a>
article has more details on how this works, if you're curious, along
with details on how special methods also work (which is more
interesting than I had any idea, and I've looked at this area
before).</p>

<p>(The distinction between what is considered a 'type' and what is
considered a 'class' by <code>repr()</code> is somewhat arbitrary; see the
sidebar <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ClassesAndTypes">here</a>. C level things defined with
<code>PyTypeObject</code> will probably always be considered types instead of
classes.)</p>

<![CDATA[X Server and VNC on a Linode VM]]>

December 24, 2020 | https://mcpcpc.com/2020/12/02/linode-x-vnc.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mcpcpc.com/2020/12/02/linode-x-vnc.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p>As part of my recent efforts to expand <a href="http://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm">xwm</a> to 
other distribution platforms, I decided to purchase a Linode virtual machine
(VM). The sole purpose of this VM is to host Docker, along with various other 
operating system containers (e.g. Debian, CentOS, Arch Linux, Void Linux, etc). 
I opted for a 5 USD shared instance which, despite only having 1GB of RAM and 1 
Core, is surprisingly fast and made pushing cross-platform package updates a 
breeze.</p>

<p>At some point I decided that it would be a good idea to run GUI-based 
applications on my shiny new VM. While the process for getting a minimal Xorg 
server up and running was fairly straight forward, I encounter a few “snags” 
that I figured would be worth sharing. Also, if it any point I decide to repeat 
this process on a different VM, I at least won’t waste any time figuring out 
what went wrong.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>For this tutorial, you will need Docker all ready installed on an image of your
choosing. I would recommend browsing the 
<a href="https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/">Linode Marketplace</a> and using the
preconfigured Docker image (which uses Debian).</p>

<h2 id="x-server">X Server</h2>

<p>To begin, let’s make sure that we have an SSH session going and are logged in as 
a regular user (a.k.a non-root). This regular user should (1) be part of the 
sudoers group and (2) be a member of the audio and video groups. If you are not 
sure which groups your regular user belongs to, you can always confirm with the 
<code>groups</code> command. If you are missing a group you can add one or multiple with the 
following command, replacing <username> with your regular user name:</username></p>

<div><div><pre><code>usermod <span>-a</span> <span>-G</span> audio video mcpcpc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We then need to verify that we have all of the prerequisite packages installed. 
Note that I specify <code>xwm</code> in the application list below, but this will also work 
with many other window managers (e.g. cwm, dwm, evilwm, etc.):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>sudo </span>apt upgrade
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>xinit x11vnc xwm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With all of the prerequisite packages installed, we need to tell xorg which 
window manager to run when starting the server. For this, we will create an 
.xinitrc file in the regular user’s HOME directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"exec xwm"</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/.xinitrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, we are almost there. We could try to start the Xorg server as a 
regular user, but the server will most likely complain and throw off multiple 
errors. To fix these errors, we need to to change some of the server’s default
permissions. Begin by opening the Xwrapper.config file for editting:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>vim /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once opened, change the <code>allowed_users=</code> value from “console” to “anybody”. This
will allow a regular user from a non-TTY (e.g. over SSH) to start the Xorg 
server. Once changed, you’r config file should like something like the one
below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Xwrapper.config (Debian X Window System server wrapper configuration file)
#
# This file was generated by the post-installation script of the
# xserver-xorg-legacy package using values from the debconf database.
#
# See the Xwrapper.config(5) manual page for more information.
#
# This file is automatically updated on upgrades of the xserver-xorg-legacy
# package *only* if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of that
# package.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command as root:
#   dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-legacy
#allowed_users=console
allowed_users=anybody
needs_root_rights=yes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember to save and close the modified Xwrapper.config file mentioned above. At 
this point we, can test the Xorg server:</p>



<p>If all goes well, the server should start right away.  If it fails, inspect the 
log file, typically located in the ~/.local/share/xorg/ directory. If it starts
successfully, we can force it to shutdown with <code>Ctrl+C</code>.</p>

<h2 id="automating-the-x-server-start">Automating the X Server Start</h2>

<p>Of course, manually starting and stopping the Xorg server is not a practical 
solution.  Instead, we will want to specify the server to start automagically
after user login. A simple way of doing this is to add a line to to our 
~/.bashrc file, which will check for tty1 and run the <code>startx</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'[ -z "$DISPLAY" ] &amp;&amp; [ "$(tty)" = /dev/tty1 ] &amp;&amp; startx'</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are manually typing in the above command, take note of the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, as 
opposed to the <code>&gt;</code> used previously. The next time you restart and/or login as 
your regular user, the Xorg server should already be running.</p>

<h2 id="vnc-server">VNC Server</h2>

<p>At this point, x11vnc should already be installed and, by just passing the 
<code>x11vnc</code> command, should run without a problem (by default, x11vnc will start
the VNC service on port “5900”). The one caveat that you might notice is when
you close the VNC session, the x11vnc service terminates as well. To have 
x11vnc running constantly, even after disconnect, we should pass the <code>--loop</code>
argument.  If we also pass <code>--bg</code>, x11vnc will continue to run forever as a 
background process:</p>



<p>Another issue to address is security. At this point, any unauthorized user 
with your IP address could potentially start a VNC session and have complete
access to the file system on your VM. To prevent this from happening, we will 
tell x11vnc to generate a secure key and prompt the user for this key on each 
new session. To generate a secure key, we need to first run x11vnc with the 
<code>-storepasswd</code> argument, which will prompt you for a plain text password and 
path to store the password (I would recommend leaving the default path as 
~/.vnc/passwd):</p>



<p>We can now specify the <code>-usepw</code> argument, which will prompt the user at
the beginning of each VNC session to enter the password generated in the
previous step:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x11vnc <span>-usepw</span> <span>--loop</span> <span>--bg</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>At this point, we should have both Xorg and VNC servers running. Some closing
remarks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are far more secure ways to go about protecting your VNC session. 
<strong>If privacy is important to you, then do not use the proposed password 
method mentioned above</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Running x11vnc in the background is nice, but I would not advise leaving it 
running 24 hours, 7 days a week. A better solution is to start the VNC server
on-demand and drop the <code>--loop</code> flag. For this, I like to create an alias:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'alias svnc="x11vnc -usepw --bg"'</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/.bashrc
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

But all those names don't tell the non-awake what it is. Even calling it “the change” is not really accurate because nothing really changed, yet paradoxically, huge change took place.

                            I had just read a passage in Ken Wilber's “<i>The Spectrum of Consciousness</i>” where he points out that ordinary awareness is ultimate awareness. This struck a chord in me. I set the book down and stared at a paper that was sitting on the table in front of me and after about a minute or two an exciting and frightening thing happened - I disappeared!</span>
                          </p>
                        <p>

                            By that I mean the middle fell right out of the equation. Normally there would be Steve over here looking at the paper on the desk over there, but now there was only the experience “paper,” and no Steve over here seeing it. It was clear that the middle that normally separated the paper from Steve did not really exist; there was only the experience, “paper.”

                            Now let me try to make this more obvious by giving an illustration.

                            Imagine as clearly as you can that you enter a large house that you have never been in before. You feel strange and kind of scared; there are furniture and drapes, but no people.
                          </span>
                          </p>

                            You wander around feeling the creepiness of being alone in this big house. You go from room to room not knowing what you will find. You start to get nervous and a little fearful being alone in this big house. You wonder how long it has been empty like this.
                          </span>
                          </p>

                          <span color="#fefefe">
                            In time the sense of the bigness and emptiness of the house starts to weigh heavily on your nerves. Finally, when you cannot stand it any longer, a shocking realization occurs to you: you're not there, either! Only the experience “house” exists.
                          </span>

                            There seems to be chance or unpredictability from a human perspective, but that is only because our time frame reference cannot see the universe emerge through its whole lifespan in a matter of minutes. If we could see that, then we would clearly see how every event was not only perfect and necessary, but even predictable. Now let's summarize so far: the universe is perfect, no one exists, yet the experience “universe” persists.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://hotwire.dev/">Hotwire</a>, which seems to be short for (H)tml (O)ver (T)he (Wire), is a collection of frameworks just announced by Basecamp that work together to help build "traditional" server-rendered web applications that look and feel to users like modern, Single-Page Applications (SPAs) built in React, Angular, Vue or other frontend frameworks. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/html-over-the-wire/">Basecamp's CTO put out a blog post</a> on why he believes in Hotwire, but most of the justification seems to be handwavy claims that JavaScript is inherently "complex," never mind that Ruby's syntax and dynamic type system can be just as head-scratching to a newcomer. I think that Basecamp's built a really interesting tool, and a better argument for Hotwire can be made by fully engaging with the benefits that SPA "<a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/thickcli.htm">thick clients</a>" bring to the table, their specific shortcomings, and all the different ways framework developers are trying to address those shortcomings today.</p><h2 id="headline-1">Problems with Web Application Development Today</h2><p>I want to separate "web app" development from general "web" development, simply because most websites aren't single-page applications, or web apps in the sense we think of gmail, or <a href="https://hey.com/">hey.com</a>. It's put most concisely in "<a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-the-web-is-really-built/">How the Web is Really Built</a>". Here, though, I'll be talking about that subset of the web which <em>can</em> be categorized more as an application than simply a web site.</p><p>Building a web app is always going to be a complex endeavour. SPA view libraries like React have emerged in the past five or so years as an awesome way to handle that complexity on the client side, allowing developers to build interactive user-interfaces in a composable way, re-using components easily in different parts of the site.</p><h3 id="headline-2">Duplication of Concerns</h3><p>Generally, when building a React app, you get any dynamic data through a loosely coupled JSON API (in my personal preference, probably written with <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a>). If you're using a web framework like Django or Ruby on Rails, then you're going to have a lot of complexity and business logic on both the frontend and backend. Whenever you add a feature, you need to ask yourself where it should be added. The loose coupling between parts that may very well be written in different languages means that it's really difficult to share code, and even if you're doing something as simple as validating a form, you'll probably end up with a decent amount of duplicated business logic, a big no-no if you follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>!</p><h3 id="headline-3">Data Fetching Boilerplate</h3><p>Loosely-coupled APIs present another challenge when building web apps: the boilerplate that comes along with getting the data out of your database and displayed in a browser. The general process for an SPA follows this outline:</p><ol><li><p>[User] Navigates to a page, submits a form, or clicks on a resource.</p></li><li><p>[Browser] Send a request, along with any route parameters and arguments, to a backend API endpoint.</p></li><li><p>[Server] API endpoint is called, fetches data from the database using the parameters in the request.</p></li><li><p>[Server] After retrieving data from the database, marshal that data into JSON to be sent back to the client.</p></li><li><p>[Browser] Receive JSON from request, un-marshal the JSON into data structures that the web app can understand.
For a React app, this would include passing the data as props to each component that uses the data to for render itself.</p></li></ol><p>And that's only the happy path! In the case of a validation error, for example, the server would return a 400 response with some JSON details, and the client again would need to catch that error, and render it properly. It really is a lot of boilerplate for any given request.</p><p>There are frontend libraries like <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> which factor out as much boilerplate as possible and encourage declarative patterns for your own data fetching, but "thick client" web apps will always need to marshal data to JSON on the server, and un-marshal to some view-able format on the client.</p><h2 id="headline-4">Managing SPA Complexity in 2020</h2><p>There's a bunch of different solutions to these problems for those who still want to provide an SPA experience, and they fall broadly into two separate categories.</p><h3 id="headline-5">Frontend-First: The JAMStack</h3><p>In recent years, there's been a big push towards the <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/">JAMStack</a>: pushing all your complexity and business logic onto your frontend, and relying mostly on commodified API services for your backend work. JSON is still the lingua franca here, but reliance on pre-built backends as a service for different functionalities, along with query languages like GraphQL, means that there isn't any backend boilerplate handled by developers. All the complexity and business logic is pushed to the client-side, which alleviates worries about duplication of concerns.</p><p>JAMStack and associated "micro-backends" like <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>, or "backends-as-a-service" like <a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a> allow people who haven't done too much backend work in the past to build truly full-stack apps on their own. <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o</a> is even building a constellation of JAMStack-oriented "micro-services" to provide the batteries to power most web apps. Hmmâ€¦ "batteries included"? Where <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">have</a> we <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">heard</a> <a href="https://laravel.com/">that</a> <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">before</a>â€¦</p><h3 id="headline-6">Backend-First: Re-discovering the batteries</h3><p>MVC Frameworks like Django and Rails came about during the heyday of Web 2.0 to abstract away a lot of the boilerplate associated with building CRUD web applications, the exact issues that we spoke about above. Back in 2006, all those interactions were through normal browser HTTP requests. SPAs, built with anything from <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> or <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> to React and Vue, were more responsive. These web frameworks became frameworks for JSON API servers, and for many web app developers, functionality like Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/">templates</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/forms/#more-about-django-form-classes">forms</a> and the battle-tested <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/generic-display/">abstractions</a> for linking them together became vestiges of an earlier age. Django's <code>Form</code> classes can render validation errors in templates with virtually no boilerplate written by developers. As soon as you want to put that form action over a JSON API, any responses from your server, which were previously just the HTML that the browser displayed, now have to be un-marshalled from JSON on the client and handled specifically. How much was Django really a "batteries included" framework if you needed to pull in <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">REST Framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jazzband/django-oauth-toolkit">OAuth Toolkit</a> whenever you wanted to work with a "modern" frontend?</p><p>Many people, myself included, enjoy modeling business logic in the ways Django and its ilk allow for. Backend-first fullstack frameworks have begun to proliferate built on top of these existing frameworks. <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">Phoenix LiveView</a> and <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> are two that come to mind immediately, and have been around for a year or more.</p><p>On Monday, even the React Core team at Facebook threw their hat in the ring, with their <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">Server Components</a> that have the opportunity to allow for React components to be rendered much like PHP templates, interspersing database calls and server-side JavaScript with the layout description inside a server component's <code>render</code> function.</p><p>These fullstack frameworks go a long way towards solving both of the concerns with traditional SPAs listed above. Separation of concerns is no longer an issue, since there is no separate, loosely coupled frontend codebase. Data fetching is drastically simpler in this paradigm. No longer does all your data need to be serialized to JSON before being converted into HTML; your data-fetching flow looks a lot more like this:</p><ol><li><p>[User] Navigates to a page, submits a form, etc.</p></li><li><p>[Server] Backend route is called, fetches/stores appropriate data from the database based on the request.</p></li><li><p>[Server] Data is used to populate an HTML template, which is sent to the client and rendered with the help of the framework.</p></li></ol><p>Your backend business logic renders HTML directly, completely replacing steps 3, 4 and 5 above with a single step: map your data into its visual representation in HTML. The two server steps remaining <em>are</em> the actual business logic in your application: the full-stack framework handles the smooth transitions, without the developer having to worry about serializing and de-serializing their own data. The logical flow of your application becomes a lot simpler for a single developer to follow and to handle.</p><p>Even React's Server Components fit this new paradigm: Data fetching no longer happens in AJAX requests, but by declaring a child server component which fetches the data and displays it in its own DOM tree without the developer having to serialize to/from JSON themselves. After the component renders on the backend, its virtual DOM gets sent to the frontend <em>by React itself</em> for display. The developer's interface into this whole process remains high-level and declarative.</p><h3 id="headline-7">As the Pendulum Swings</h3><p>We started the decade with frameworks like <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a> with extremely tight couplings between the client and server, and after a long time wandering in the wilderness of duplicated compelxity across loosely-coupled frontend and backend, it seems like we're entering the twenties with a renewed push towards a <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">more monolithic</a> approach to web development.

- Crafted the OpenSMTPD 6.8.0p1 release
- Fixed several bugs in the way
- Proposed a few OpenSMTPD improvements to OpenBSD
- Working on my OpenSMTPD book</blockquote><p>As usual, a <strong>huge</strong> thanks goes to the people <strong>sponsoring me</strong> on <strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/gilles">patreon</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/poolpOrg">github</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://liberapay.com/poolpOrg">liberaPay</a></strong>, the work in this post was made possible by my <strong><a href="https://poolp.org/sponsorship/">sponsorship</a></strong>.</p><p>Relax.</p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EK2cYxNmUDE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center><p>First of all,
I must say how <strong>grateful and happy</strong> I am that people <strong>value my work enough to trust and sponsor me</strong>,
I appreciate it a lot and it is a <strong>huge motivation booster</strong>.</p><p>I initially thought that after a few months I might have about 10 sponsors,
but here we are after a year or so with <strong>over 50 sponsors</strong> !</p><p>Please let me know what you want me to work on,
I may or may not do it (based on my interest and skills) but at least I’ll have an idea how to attract more sponsors as I’m clueless.</p><p>Thank you all and hopefully when December 2021 hits, I can give a three-digits number and spend more time on coding and writing for a hobby :-)</p><p>I spent a lot of time preparing the <strong>OpenSMTPD 6.8.0p1 release</strong> that SHOULD have been released in November shortly after OpenBSD 6.8 was out,
but which <strong>I couldn’t find time to work</strong> on as I was contracted for some private work.</p><p>As I prepared the release,
I had to fix several issues,
some specific to the portable version and some that have been fixed upstream at OpenBSD.</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/misc@opensmtpd.org/msg05188.html">6.8.0p1 release was published today</a></strong> and <strong>contains the fixes</strong> for the issues mentioned below.</p><h2 id="fixed-macos-build">Fixed macOS build</h2><p>The build on macOS was broken due to a missing OpenSSL include.</p><p>A user submitted a pull request that fixed the build but another user reported that this was <strong>not enough for older macOS</strong> that lack the <code>clock_gettime()</code> call which we use in the profiling code.</p><p>I’m not familiar enough (at all) with macOS to figure out which versions are “old” but this seems to fall into the “legacy” bucket and as far as the <strong>latest releases</strong> are concerned there is no known problems.</p><p>I don’t intend to support all legacy systems out there but since fixing the <code>clock_gettime()</code> issue might be beneficial to portability outside of macOS, <strong>I started tackling the issue and am almost done</strong>.</p><h2 id="fixed-get_progname-bug">Fixed get_progname() bug</h2><p>A bug was introduced over a release ago which caused OpenSMTPD to <strong>improperly log the process name in maillog on some systems</strong>.</p><p>It was weird because the process names were correctly reported in the <code>ps</code> output, they just weren’t in the logs.</p><p>I traced it back to a broken feature detection in <code>configure.ac</code> leading to the <code>setprotctitle()</code> workaround not working correctly.</p><p>Issue was <strong>fixed and committed</strong> to the portable repository.</p><p>When OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 was released a year ago,
it brought support for <strong>server-side ECDSA certificates</strong> but with the caveat that it only worked with LibreSSL.
OpenSMTPD would build with OpenSSL but disable server-side ECDSA support.</p><p>People assumed that this was done because I wanted to push LibreSSL as otherwise I could have just added a few <code>#ifdef</code> and handled both,
but this was of course not the reason.</p><p><a href="https://poolp.org/posts/2019-06-02/may-2019-report/">As I wrote in June 2019</a>,
the crypto operations in OpenSMTPD are done in a <strong>special way</strong> compared to what’s commonly seen.
As a result,
adding support to ECDSA was not just about slapping a few <code>#ifdef</code> and calling the proper function but required writing a custom crypto engine which,
unluckily for me,
uses an API that <strong>diverged between LibreSSL and OpenSSL</strong>.</p><p>I didn’t have interest in doing that work because it’s not very pleasant,
but people kept asking for it and a user contacted me in private to ask if I was willing to accept a sponsored development to do that work.</p><p>I accepted and worked on it for a few days until I could start OpenSMTPD on an Ubuntu with OpenSSL and use ECDSA certificates.
A few people tested the diff and reported success so <strong>it was committed</strong> to the portable repository.</p><p>I’d like to thank again that user who wishes to remain anonymous,
this sponsored development helped me replace my laptop with a new MacBook Air which is lovely,
and the result <strong>benefits all users of OpenSMTPD portable</strong>.</p><center><img src="https://poolp.org/images/2020-12-new_laptop.jpg"></center><h2 id="plugged-multiple-memory-leaks">Plugged multiple memory leaks</h2><p>As I requested feedback on the release candidate for OpenSMTPD 6.8.0p1,
another user reported a <strong>memory leak</strong> which sent me on a big hunt.</p><p>Thanks to a <code>top</code> output I knew it was the <code>lookup process</code>…
but that process covers several scopes as it is in charge of <strong>DNS lookups</strong>,
<strong>table lookups</strong> and <strong>passing information back and forth between an SMTP session and filters</strong>.
I didn’t have an immediate intuition where the leak could come from as is often the case with other processes.</p><p>I was suspicious of the <strong>filters layer</strong> since filters are still somewhat experimental and recent,
however there are <strong>very few runtime allocations</strong> there and I could not find any unbalanced allocation
<strong><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/21522cbeb01f50e971ec01911918d719023484fd#diff-6cb46d1f1c7fb0972d7569a29ef930a534cade4034f526f1083e4dfb9f5a6599">except for a minor one</a></strong> that could not explain a noticeable leak.
This was confirmed when the user applied the diff and saw no improvement whatsoever.</p><p>Then I started being suspicious of <strong>DNS lookups</strong> and ended up diving into the <code>resolver.c</code> interface to <code>asr</code>, the asynchronous resolver.
This led to <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/ce5509e44fe2267548c237d9c134a82641183226#diff-6cb46d1f1c7fb0972d7569a29ef930a534cade4034f526f1083e4dfb9f5a6599">another small leak</a> found in OpenSMTPD and <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/caf7b7a2ea9bf223de3b73d4b702f2249359245f#diff-01bed4da21c6a83cc09cf6951ac885c4196a3c119bcc5bd61ac0b1ebddeca96c">another one in asr itself</a> prompting a diff from Eric Faurot in OpenBSD’s libc.
This was slightly more noticeable than the previous one but still not very significant, it was <strong>barely visible</strong> on my own MX that had been running for a year without a restart.</p><p>Finally, I had a eureka moment and convinced myself to look at the handling of <strong>regex lookup</strong> in tables.
It turns out that a <code>regfree()</code> call was missing which caused a <code>regex_t</code> to leak for each regex lookup.
<strong>Depending on the OpenSMTPD configuration</strong>, the use of regex, the size of tables used by regex and the filters in place,
the leak <strong>could grow from fully inexistant to very significant</strong>.</p><p>I submitted a diff to OpenBSD <strong><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/79a034b4aed29e965f45a13409268290c9910043#diff-6cb46d1f1c7fb0972d7569a29ef930a534cade4034f526f1083e4dfb9f5a6599">that was committed today by martijn@</a></strong>.</p><h2 id="tracked-and-found-a-possible-crash-in-the-filters-state-machine">Tracked and found a possible crash in the filters state machine</h2><p>As I was tracking the memory leak above,
I came up by accident with a script that caused the OpenSMTPD instance on my laptop to <strong>crash</strong>… just once.
I tried to reproduce multiple times without success and decided to stop tracking the leak and focus on finding what caused the crash as it was more concerning.</p><p>I spent hours adapting my script to play different kinds of sessions with varying number of recipients, concurrency levels and amounts of data sent.
Eventually, I managed to get a <strong>kill script</strong> that would reliably crash my instance after a few seconds of running.
It highly suggested a race condition.</p><p>I tested the script on various instances with different configurations and realised that this did not affect all OpenSMTPD setups,
but required a <strong>specific configuration</strong> and a <strong>specific client pattern to trigger</strong>.
I could not crash a default install or my main MX which makes use of a lot of features, including filters, but I could easily crash my submission MX.</p><p>The bug was tracked for two days and it ended up being a <strong>logic issue in the filters state machine</strong> which could cause the io channel between the SMTP engine and the filters layer to be released while filters were still processing a request. Upon return from a filter, the channel would be expected to be writeable but it would in turn be NULL.</p><p>This led to <strong><a href="https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/6c3220444ed06b5796dedfd53a0f4becd903c0d1#diff-6cb46d1f1c7fb0972d7569a29ef930a534cade4034f526f1083e4dfb9f5a6599">a fix being committed to OpenBSD-current</a></strong> and an <strong><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata68.html">errata</a></strong> published today.</p><p>With the 6.8.0p1 release out of the way, I worked on a few diffs for future releases.</p><h2 id="suggested-the-rename-of-opensmtpd-processes-diff-sent-upstream">Suggested the rename of OpenSMTPD processes (diff sent upstream)</h2><p>Many years ago,
OpenSMTPD had dedicated processes for the MDA and the MTA processes.
OpenBSD hackers requested that I factor things a bit and merge these processes because they were both unprivileged and chrooted to <code>/var/empty</code>,
making it <strong>pointless to over-isolate them</strong>.</p><p>We couldn’t find a proper name for the new process in charge of both MDA and MTA,
but <strong>since an OpenBSD hacker had repeatedly requested that I offer him a pony</strong> I decided to temporarily name the process <code>pony express</code> (if you don’t understand why it’s funny, I can’t help).
Later, the joke was improved by another developer when he named the new privsep crypto agent <code>klondike</code>.</p><p>As years passed,
I considered renaming multiple times but could not convince myself the alternative names were better,
and when I found better names they would not convince others.
When a user said that these names were useless and unprofessional,
I decided to let the joke run longer.</p><p>Years later,
I think the joke has been utilized to its fullest and is now bugging me for both technical (a space in the name of a process is annoying) and non-technical reasons.</p><p>When the configuration file changed a while back to split rules into <code>action</code> and <code>match</code> sets,
the concept of <code>dispatchers</code> was introduced in the code:
an envelope is matched and based on the action,
it is scheduled to a local or a remote dispatcher.</p><p>I <a href="http://openbsd-archive.7691.n7.nabble.com/diff-src-usr-sbin-smtpd-change-process-names-td404136.html">sent a diff</a> to OpenBSD suggesting that the <code>pony express</code> process be renamed <code>dispatcher</code>,
and that the <code>klondike</code> process be renamed <code>crypto</code>.
I don’t know if/when this will be committed but the feedback was positive.</p><h2 id="suggested-explicitly-requesting-forward-files-diff-sent-upstream">Suggested explicitly requesting forward files (diff sent upstream)</h2><p>Whenever a local dispatcher is used (actions <code>mbox</code>, <code>maildir</code>, <code>mda</code> or <code>lmtp</code>),
OpenSMTPD will unconditionally look for a <code>~/.forward</code> file in the recipients home directory.
This is a mechanism that today can’t be turned off by an admin.</p><p>I <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=160841747511126&amp;w=2">sent a diff</a> to OpenBSD suggesting the <strong>introduction of a <code>forward-file</code> option</strong>.</p><p>The idea is to have OpenSMTPD consider it must NOT try to process <code>~/.forward</code> files unless the admin explicitly requests it by adding the <code>forward-file</code> keyword to a local action.
In the example below,
I configure two domains with maildir,
one not supporting forward files and the other supporting it:</p><pre><code>action "local_users_1" maildir
action "local_users_2" maildir forward-file

match from any for domain "foobar.org" action "local_users_1"
match from any for domain "barbaz.org" action "local_users_2"
</code></pre><p>The benefit is that this <strong>reduces the attack surface</strong> on setups where <code>~/.forward</code> files are not desired.
Processing these files require <strong>an indirection through the parent process to open the file on behalf of the daemon</strong>,
but if we know we don’t want to process them <strong>the indirection can be bypassed</strong>.</p><p>I don’t …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>
<p>—David Epstein, <em>Range</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/18d8ec9ae04a2c4c035133ad9aab1f75d1df93f7/200f9/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>

<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://salman.io/notes/the-definition-of-a-polymath">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://letter.salman.io/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>

</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a46c9dc99267b1f6c2063c80a13243e7dca38bba/ef187/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>

  </a>
</p>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><strong>What are Metadata and Hidden Data?</strong></h2>
<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>Metadata refers to information “about” a record.&nbsp; For a Microsoft Word document, this could include information such as the author of the document, the date and time the document was created, the time spent editing the document, its length, its description, comments about the document, etc.&nbsp; For a digital photograph, the metadata might include the type of camera or other device used to create the image, the location where it was taken, and the date and time it was taken, as well as other information.</p>
<p>Electronic records, whether they are Word documents, PDF files, image files, or otherwise, almost always contain metadata which is embedded inside the record itself.&nbsp; Although this information can be retrieved using appropriate software, it is mostly invisible to anyone who isn’t looking for it – i.e., anyone who merely opens, views, edits, or prints the file.</p>
<h3>Hidden Data</h3>
<p>The term “hidden data” includes the metadata embedded in a file, but also has a broader meaning.&nbsp; Hidden data can refer to any extra information in a document or image which is not immediately visible to the user.&nbsp; For example, text can be hidden in a Word document by setting its colour to white, or by setting its background colour to black.&nbsp; While such text will generally not be visible when a document is viewed or printed, the text still exists in the Word document and can be retrieved (such as by changing the text style or through other means).&nbsp; Microsoft Word documents may also contain tracked changes and thereby retain deleted text, earlier versions of the text, and comments from reviewers.&nbsp; These changes, comments and deleted text are sometimes hidden from view when the document is opened, and may not appear in the printed version of the document either, but they can be easily retrieved by anyone who has the electronic version of the document.</p>
<p>Image files can contain “hidden data” too, such as a watermark that is not visible to human eyes but whose data can be retrieved using an appropriate software tool, or “artifacts” that can leave traces of how an image has been edited or modified.</p>
<h2><strong>Does your institution know what it is disclosing?</strong></h2>
<p>Does your institution regularly disclose electronic versions of documents to requestors when asked to do so?&nbsp; Have you ever given thought to exactly what information may be hidden in the electronic version of a document?</p>
<p>In today’s article, we’ll describe some of the hidden information that may be exposed through the disclosure of electronic records, and consider whether routinely disclosing electronic versions of documents is a safe practice from a privacy perspective.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain Text vs. Microsoft Word</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s demonstrate how much “extra” information can be hidden inside a basic Word file.</p>
<p>We’ll start by creating a small “plain text” file.</p>
<p>1. In Windows Notepad, type the text “This is a test.” and then save the file:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="384" data-permalink="https://foiassist.ca/2019/04/04/i-thought-we-deleted-that-metadata-and-hidden-data/1-plain-text-document/" data-orig-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png" data-orig-size="492,193" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1 plain text document" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png?w=492" src="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png?w=750" alt="1 plain text document" srcset="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png 492w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png?w=150 150w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1-plain-text-document.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px"></p>
<p>2. After saving this file as plain text, we can right-click on the saved file and then click on “Properties” to see the file’s size:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="392" data-permalink="https://foiassist.ca/2019/04/04/i-thought-we-deleted-that-metadata-and-hidden-data/1-5-plain-text-properties/" data-orig-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png" data-orig-size="1137,1077" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1.5 plain text properties" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=750" src="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=750" alt="1.5 plain text properties.png" srcset="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=750 750w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=150 150w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=300 300w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=768 768w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png?w=1024 1024w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1.5-plain-text-properties-4.png 1137w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p>
<p>This is what comes up:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="385" data-permalink="https://foiassist.ca/2019/04/04/i-thought-we-deleted-that-metadata-and-hidden-data/2-plain-text-document-file-size/" data-orig-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png" data-orig-size="543,777" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2 plain text document file size" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png?w=210" data-large-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png?w=543" src="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png?w=750" alt="2 plain text document file size" srcset="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png 543w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png?w=105 105w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/2-plain-text-document-file-size.png?w=210 210w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px"></p>

<p>The size of the file is 15 bytes.&nbsp; This makes sense, as the text “This is a test.” is itself 15 characters long (including letters, spaces and the period at the end).&nbsp; Each character takes one byte of disk space to store on the computer.</p>
<p>3. Next, let’s open this same file in Microsoft Word:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="386" data-permalink="https://foiassist.ca/2019/04/04/i-thought-we-deleted-that-metadata-and-hidden-data/3-word-document/" data-orig-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png" data-orig-size="1094,760" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="3 word document" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=750" src="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=750" alt="3 word document" srcset="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=750 750w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=150 150w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=300 300w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=768 768w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png?w=1024 1024w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/3-word-document.png 1094w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p>
<p>4. And now we’ll save it as a Microsoft Word file (with a .docx extension).</p>
<p>5. We can then right-click on the new file and then click on “Properties” to see the Word file’s size:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="387" data-permalink="https://foiassist.ca/2019/04/04/i-thought-we-deleted-that-metadata-and-hidden-data/4-word-document-file-size/" data-orig-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png" data-orig-size="543,777" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="4 word document file size" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png?w=210" data-large-file="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png?w=543" src="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png?w=750" alt="4 word document file size" srcset="https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png 543w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png?w=105 105w, https://foiassist.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/4-word-document-file-size.png?w=210 210w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px"></p>
<p>The Microsoft Word file containing just the text “This is a test.” is 12,164 bytes, or nearly 1,000 times the size of the original plain text file we created in Windows Notepad.&nbsp; This is enough space to store over 12,000 characters.&nbsp; That is a lot of data!&nbsp; A standard 8.5 x 11 inch page holds about 4,000 characters of text (single-spaced), so 12,164 characters is about three single-spaced pages’ worth of information.</p>
<p>Besides the 15 bytes required to store the text “This is a test.”, what other information is being stored in this Microsoft Word file?&nbsp; We can’t simply open the file in Windows Notepad to examine it directly, because not all of the information is stored in a human-readable format.&nbsp; Helpfully, Microsoft has published <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/remove-hidden-data-and-personal-information-by-inspecting-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-356b7b5d-77af-44fe-a07f-9aa4d085966f">an article</a> which describes the information stored in various Microsoft Office file formats, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio.</p>
<h3>Types of Hidden Data in Microsoft Word Files</h3>
<p>Let’s see what kinds of data may be contained in a Word document, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/remove-hidden-data-and-personal-information-by-inspecting-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-356b7b5d-77af-44fe-a07f-9aa4d085966f">according to Microsoft</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Word documents can contain the following types of hidden data and personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Comments, revision marks from tracked changes, versions, and ink annotations</strong> If you’ve collaborated with other people to create your document, your document might contain items such as revision marks from tracked changes, comments, ink annotations, or versions. This information can enable other people to see the names of people who worked on your document, comments from reviewers, and changes that were made to your document, things that you might not want to share outside of your team.</span></li>
<li><strong>Document properties and personal information</strong> Document properties, or metadata, include details about your document such as author, subject, and title. Document properties also include information that is automatically maintained by Office programs, such as the name of the person who most recently saved a document and the date when a document was created. If you used specific features, your document might also contain additional kinds of personally identifiable information (PII), such as e-mail headers, send-for-review information, routing slips, and template names.</li>
<li><strong>Headers, footers, and watermarks</strong> Word documents can contain information in headers and footers. Additionally, you might have added a watermark to your Word document.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden text</strong> Word documents can contain text that is formatted as hidden text. If you do not know whether your document contains hidden text, you can use the Document Inspector to search for it.</li>
<li><strong>Document server properties</strong> If your document was saved to a location on a document management server, such as a Document Workspace site or a library based on Windows SharePoint Services, the document might contain additional document properties or information related to this server location.</li>
<li><strong>Custom XML data</strong> Documents can contain custom XML data that is not visible in the document itself. The Document Inspector can find and remove this XML data.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From a privacy perspective, the following items from the excerpt above may raise concerns:</p>
<h4>Comments and revision marks</h4>
<p>A document may contain comments and revisions made by various contributors that the institution would never intentionally disclose.&nbsp; Such comments may be subject to a number of exemptions under the&nbsp;<em>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</em> (FIPPA) and the <em>Municipal Freedom of Protection and Privacy Act</em> (MFIPPA), with some of the most relevant being <em>Advice or recommendations</em> (FIPPA s.13 / MFIPPA s.7); <em>Relations with other governments</em> (FIPPA s.15); <em>Third party information</em> (FIPPA s.17 / MFIPPA s.10); <em>Economic and other interests of Ontario</em> (FIPPA s.18 / MFIPPA s.11); and <em>Solicitor-client privilege</em> (FIPPA s.19 / MFIPPA s.12).&nbsp; These comments and revision marks may not be immediately visible when a Microsoft Word document is opened and viewed or printed, but they will be included any time the electronic version is disclosed.&nbsp; And they may include text that the institution intended to delete from the document.</p>
<h4>Details about your document such as author, subject, and title</h4>
<p>Disclosing the “author” of a document is not necessarily problematic – however, the “author” information may not be accurate.&nbsp; For example, a document created from a precedent may include the name of the author of the precedent rather than the author of the version of the document disclosed to the requestor.</p>
<h4>Additional kinds of personally identifiable information (PII), such as e-mail headers, send-for-review information, routing slips, and template names</h4>
<p>Notably, Microsoft states here that Word documents may contain personally identifiable information (PII) without providing an exhaustive list of what kids of PII information may be included, raising the spectre of an unauthorized disclosure of personal information in breach of FIPPA s.21 and MFIPPA s.14.</p>
<h4>Hidden text</h4>
<p>Documents can contain text that is not immediately visible when the document is opened or printed.&nbsp; For example, text may be “redacted” by changing its background colour to black.&nbsp; This will give the appearance of redacted text when the document is viewed, but the “redaction” can be easily reversed by anyone who receives the electronic version.&nbsp; Likewise, any white text on a white background will not immediately be visible, but can be easily viewed by anyone who has the original file.</p>
<h3>An additional concern:&nbsp; “Fast Saving”</h3>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft Word includes a “fast save” feature, which makes saving faster by storing all changes incrementally as they are made, instead of generating a new file from scratch each time a document is saved.&nbsp; The advantage of using “fast saving” is that it makes saving a document much faster; the downside is that potentially every note and change that was saved in the document at any point while it was being drafted <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/disable-the-fast-save-feature-word-3539746">may be preserved</a> in the final electronic record.</p>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>

Highly trained moral philosophers can have deep disagreements about them. Though I myself have studied ethics and political philosophy for much of my academic career, I am deeply grateful that I don't have to make those judgment calls. But for all of those difficulties, there are also some bedrock principles on which virtually all moral philosophers have long agreed.</p><p>The first is that we should avoid “leveling down” everyone’s quality of life for the purpose of achieving equality. It is unjust when some people have plenty of food while others are starving. But alleviating that inequality by making sure that an even greater number of people starve is clearly wrong. The second is that we should not use ascriptive characteristics like race or ethnicity to allocate medical resources. To save one patient rather than another based on the color of their skin rightly strikes most philosophers—and most Americans—as barbaric.&nbsp;The Centers for Disease Control have just thrown both of these principles overboard in the name of social justice.</p><p>In one of the most shocking moral misjudgments by a public body I have ever seen, the CDC invoked considerations of “social justice” to recommend providing vaccinations&nbsp;to essential workers before older Americans even though this would, according to its own models, lead to a much greater death toll. After a massive public outcry, the agency has adopted revised recommendations. But though these are a clear improvement, they still violate the two bedrock principles of allocative justice—and are likely to cause unnecessary suffering on a significant scale.</p><p>Since states will now have to decide whether to follow the CDC’s recommendations, the fight for a just distribution of the vaccine is not yet over. At the same time, the past days have already taught us two lessons that sum up some of the most worrying developments of the past years: The attack on philosophically liberal principles has by now migrated from leafy college campuses to the most important and powerful organizations in the country. And, in part as a result, it is getting harder and harder to trust institutions from the CDC to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><p><em>To learn more about Persuasion, <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-purpose-of-persuasion">read our founding manifesto</a>.</em></p><p>On November 23rd, Kathleen Dooling, a public health official at the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf">gave a presentation</a> to the&nbsp;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&nbsp;(ACIP), which is tasked with developing the recommendation on who should first get access to the vaccine against Covid. In a stark departure from the course of action adopted in virtually every other developed democracy, Dooling recommended that 87 million essential workers—a very broad category including bankers and movie crews as well as teachers or supermarket cashiers—should get the vaccine before older Americans, even though the elderly are much more likely to die from the disease. The committee unanimously accepted the recommendations.</p><p>Dooling’s presentation laid out three different metrics for evaluating whether 87 million “essential workers” or Americans over the age of 65 should be next in line: feasibility, science, and ethics. According to the CDC's own evaluation, considerations of feasibility give us reasons to prioritize older Americans. This makes sense. It is both difficult to determine who should count as an essential worker and to communicate to people who do fall into that category that they are eligible. A straightforward age cut-off makes it easier to decide who's in and reach the target population. As a result, prioritizing the older than 65s leads by this metric.</p><p>Considerations of “science” also seemed to point in the same direction. As the presentation acknowledged, the likelihood of dying from Covid strongly depends on age. According to the CDC’s model, prioritizing essential workers over the elderly would therefore increase the overall number of deaths by between 0.5% and 6.5%. In other words, it would likely result in the preventable deaths of thousands of Americans.</p><p>And yet, the presentation concluded that science does <em>not</em> provide a reason to prioritize the elderly. For, as Kathleen Dooling wrote in one of the most jaw-dropping sentences I have ever seen in a document written by a public official, differences in expected consequences that could amount to thousands of additional deaths are “minimal.”</p><p>This allowed Dooling to focus on “ethical” principles in selecting the best course of action. Highlighting the most important consideration in red, Dooling emphasized that “racial and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among adults &gt; 65.” In other words, America’s elderly are too white to be considered a top priority for the distribution of the vaccine against Covid. It is on this basis that ACIP awarded three times as many points to prioritizing the more racially diverse group of essential workers, making the crucial difference in the overall determination. Astonishingly, the higher overall death toll that would have resulted from this course of action does not feature as an ethical reason to prioritize older Americans.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/781c2d1d-4bc5-4578-86f1-330254e6936e_2556x1430.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:191902,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In the days after ACIP published its preliminary recommendations, barely any epidemiologists or health officials publicly criticized its findings or its reasoning. But thankfully, prominent journalists like <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/will-the-us-snatch-defeat-from-the">Zeynep Tufecki</a>, <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/vaccinate-elderly">Matt Yglesias</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1340361755403366400">Nate Silver</a> publicly made the case against them. (<a href="https://twitter.com/Yascha_Mounk/status/1340009058280103938">So did I</a>.)</p><p>It is, all of us acknowledge, very important to ensure that members of ethnic minorities are not excluded from access to the vaccine on the basis of their race. But to prioritize a 23-year-old Latino Uber driver who is very likely to weather infection with Covid over an 80-year-old white retiree who is likely to die from it because the former is part of a group that includes marginally more brown people and the latter is part of a group that includes marginally more white people is to inscribe racial discrimination at the heart of American public policy in an astonishing manner.</p><p>It gets even more shocking. The difference in the percentage of white people across age groups is comparatively small. The difference in the percentage of infected people who succumb to Covid across all age groups is massive. Giving the vaccine to African-American essential workers before elderly African-Americans would likely raise the overall death toll of African-Americans even if a somewhat greater number of African-Americans were to receive the vaccine as a result.</p><p>In other words,&nbsp;the CDC was effectively about to recommend that a greater <em>number</em> of African-Americans die so that the <em>share</em> of African-Americans who receive the vaccine is slightly higher.&nbsp;In blatant violation of the “leveling down objection,” prioritizing essential workers in the name of equality would likely kill more people in&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;relevant demographic groups.</p><p>As criticism of the recommendations mounted, epidemiologists mostly circled the wagon. But thankfully, the pressure was too strong to ignore. At a meeting that had, before the mounting controversy, been expected to rubber-stamp the recommendations that had already been unanimously accepted, ACIP changed course. It now suggested a more complicated scheme. Once medical workers had received the vaccine, both Americans over the age of 74 and essential <em>frontline</em> workers would be vaccinated; in a second phase, Americans over the age of 64 and the broader group of all remaining essential workers would get access to the vaccine.</p><p>Since over half of all deaths from Covid have so far occurred among Americans over the age of 74, this is an undoubted improvement over the initial guidance. But, for two reasons, it too probably sacrifices American lives on the altar of social justice. First, vaccinating Americans over the age of 74 <em>over the same period of time </em>as frontline essential workers will significantly delay when some of those who are at greatest risk will receive the vaccine. And second, starting to vaccinate Americans between the ages of 65 and 74 <em>after </em>30 million frontline essential workers will still put a large group with a comparatively low risk of death ahead of a large group with a significantly higher risk of death. </p><p>Just how many additional deaths will result from the ongoing refusal to prioritize those who are at the highest risk of dying? The CDC won’t tell us. In the updated presentation, Dooling once again claims that the difference between the CDC’s preferred course of action and a more strictly age-based approach is “minimal.” But this time around, ACIP has hidden the ball. The updated guidance, which was adopted with a 11-1 majority on December 20th, no longer includes an estimate of how many more people are likely to die if states follow its recommendation.</p><p><em>Get our articles directly into your inbox, and support the work of Persuasion, by <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/subscribe">becoming a subscriber</a>.</em></p><p>Over the past years, stories of campus craziness have frequently made the national news. Whenever some student group or another tried to stop a public figure from speaking at their university, or boycotted the local dining hall over the inauthentic nature of its sushi, many people understandably responded in a dismissive manner: “Activists on campus have always been a little silly,” they’d say. “This won't affect the real world.”</p><p>It is now clear that this was a serious misjudgment. Many of the trends that started on campus have been rapidly taking over established institutions, from Google to the Centers for Disease Control. Perhaps the most dangerous of these is that many professionals now fear to oppose any proposal that is presented, however implausibly, in the language of social justice—even if its foreseeable consequence is to kill a greater number of African-Americans in the name of “ethics.”</p><p>America’s botched guidance on who gets the vaccine first should, once and for all, put the idea that the excesses of wokeness are a small …</p></div></div>

<p>It was Mark Twain’s last Christmas. His authorized biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, sat in the driver’s seat of an Aeolian Orchestrelle, one of the most powerful reed organs on the market, and pedaled out <strong>Schubert’s Impromptu No. 2 in A-Major</strong>.&nbsp; “A turmoil of Christmas presents,” as Twain described them, were laid out in an upstairs parlor and, in the balcony off the library, stood a half-decorated tree which his youngest daughter, Jean Clemens, had intended to surprise him with. </p>
<p>Instead of celebrating, the 74-year-old author listened to Schubert’s deceptively simple melody and, through the window, watched the hearse carrying Jean’s coffin “wind along the road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow.” She had drowned in the bathtub during an epileptic seizure. She was 29 years old.</p>
<p>Twain could not bear to accompany the coffin himself and so he sent for his nephew, Jervis Langdon, named after the father-in-law he idolized. Overnight Jervis and the hearse would cover the distance between Twain’s Stormfield estate and Woodlawn<a href="https://marktwainstudies.com/online-resources/quarry-farm-virtual-tour/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://marktwainstudies.com/online-resources/quarry-farm-virtual-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>Cemetery in Elmira to deliver Jean, as Twain put it, “to her distant childhood home, where she will lie by her mother’s side once more, in the company of Susy and Langdon.”</p>
<p>Having already witnessed the burial of half a dozen family members, including his wife and two of his children, in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marktwainstudies.com/online-resources/quarry-farm-virtual-tour/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://marktwainstudies.com/online-resources/quarry-farm-virtual-tour/" target="_blank">the Langdon-Clemens family plot at Woodlawn</a>, Twain did not feel it necessary to attend the ceremony in order to feel its effects. “The funeral has begun,” he wrote, “Four hundred miles away, but I can see it all, just as if I were there. The scene is the library, in the Langdon homestead. Jean’s coffin stands where her mother and I stood, forty years ago, and were married; and where Susy’s coffin stood thirteen years ago; where her mother’s stood, five years and a half ago; and where mine will stand, after a little time.”</p>
<p>Indeed, four months after these words were written, Jervis Langdon would, like the family’s personal reaper, deliver another coffin to Woodlawn. </p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>At Mark Twain’s public funeral in New York City, an organist from Lafayette, Indiana named Clarence Dickinson, who would go on to become one of the most influential American composers of his generation, played <strong>Frederic Chopin’s Sonata No. 2 in B-flat Minor</strong>, another of the well-worn organ reels which could be found in the deceased’s collection. </p>
<p>Dark, classical compositions like Chopin’s Funeral March were, to Twain, stimulants for introspection, helping to elicit memories which not only satisfied his mourning, but also fueled his late writing. </p>

<p>The Aeolian Orchestrelle which he had installed as aid to both his grief and his art, was enormous and expensive, costing the contemporary equivalent of $70,000. It was as close to cathedral organ as could be purchased for a private home. Sometimes Twain pressed Paine and other members of his household to sit for hours pedaling out his favorite reels, like a sentimental teenager listening to power ballads on repeat. But it could also be a source of jubilation, as when he and Jean sat together on the bench, or when it provided accompaniment for Clara Clemens’s impromptu performances. Twain had it played in the presence of his friend, Helen Keller, and was amazed when, recognizing the vibrations it made, she said, simply, “Music.”</p>
<p>Whether his guests were gathered around it to make merry or it was providing the soundtrack for his solitary drinking, the Aeolian Orchestrelle became the centerpiece of Twain’s daily activity for the final five years of his life, and the music it played was the soundtrack for his work during this period. Twain spent the vast majority of this time at his Stormfield estate in Connecticut, but on the few occasions he did briefly relocate he had the Orchestrelle disassembled and shipped to his temporary residences. He was not willing to be without its music for more than a few days at a time.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>On his final Christmas, he remembered sitting beside Jean only a few days earlier as she played Schubert’s Impromptu. As her hearse crept over the horizon, and the memorable final chords resonated, the bereft father requested two more pieces of music, one for his eldest daughter, Susy, who had died of spinal meningitis thirteen years earlier, and another for his wife, Livy, who, though a full decade younger than him, had already been dead five years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He purchased the Orchestrelle only a few months after Livy died. It was a characteristically counterintuitive monument to her loss, a lavish expenditure which she would certainly never have approved of. Writing to his sister-in-law, Susan Crane, late at night several months after Livy’s funeral, Twain reported that he had, for the first time in many weeks, pried himself from bed, only to venture into the sitting room where “there was not a thing visible anywhere that had not been made holy by the touch of Livy’s hand.” </p>
<p>Overcome again with grief, Twain requested his secretary, Isabel Lyon, take a shift at the Orchestrelle. For four hours, he sat staring out at the storm and requesting “dirges, funeral marches, and – saddest of all – wedding marches.” “The wedding is never otherwise than a tragic event,” he told Crane, “upon the wedding-bell should be written ‘A day is coming when one of these hearts shall break.'” </p>
<p>Few works capture the combination of present celebration and anticipated tragedy which widower Twain describes so well as <strong>Handel’s Largo from <em>Xerxes</em></strong>. The opera, depicting a royal love triangle, was a critical and commercial failure during Handel’s life, but the music was revived in the nineteenth-century, with “Ombra mai fu” becoming particularly popular at both weddings and funerals. Twain frequently asked Lyon to play it three or four times in succession.</p>
<p>“Elsewhere in my Autobiography,” Twain promises in his final entry, “I have told how the Intermezzo and the Largo came to be associated in my heart with Susy and Livy in their last hours of life.” </p>
<p>If that was in fact the case, the pages in question did not survive. </p>
<p>But Lyon recalls in her own journal that on one of the many occasions he requested that she play these pieces, he created a scene not unlike his later vision of Jean’s funeral, amalgamating his memories with vivid fantasy: “I can fit words to both those pieces, as the coffins of Susie and her mother are borne through the dining room and the hall and the drawing room of the Hartford house, Susie calls to me in the Intermezzo and her mother in the Largo – and they are lamenting that they shall see that place no more.”</p>
<p>Livy’s coffin never passed through Hartford and Twain was not present to see Susy’s conveyed. Music was a catalyst for the memory of a house which he knew well, but also, more importantly, for Twain’s creation of scenes of mourning which had been denied him by the actual circumstances of his wife and eldest daughter’s deaths. Letting the song wash over him was not a concession to nostalgia and regret, but rather fuel for therapeutic invention. Sam narrated scenarios involving his family which offered peace and closure, not for them, but for himself.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Lyon acknowledged, “The music is wonderful. The Largo is like a caress.”</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>Though Twain often satired conventional depictions of heaven and the hereafter, he retained a faith that death was a “merciful release.” This was perhaps a necessary mode of coping for somebody who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/757711" data-type="URL" data-id="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/757711" target="_blank">had been disproportionately visited by trauma and tragedy</a>. </p>
<p>In just the year preceding Jean’s death, Twain had attended the funerals of his favorite nephew and namesake, Samuel Moffett, and Henry Rogers, the renowned financier Twain considered his “best friend.” He had also lost two of his favorite editors, Richard W. Gilder of <em>Century </em>magazine and William M. Laffan of the <em>New York Sun</em>, both of whom Twain considered “old, old friends,” but whose funerals he could not attend without risks to his own failing health. All were at least five years younger than him, but he was accustomed to losing loved ones prematurely. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>While Paine and Lyon worried that he was being consumed by grief, in private writings Twain repeatedly expresses nothing short of “envy” for the deceased. Reflecting on Jean’s corpse, he saw, as he had previously seen in his wife, that “all trace of care, and trouble, and suffering, and the corroding years had vanished.” “Would I bring her back to life if I could do it?” Twain wrote, “I would not. If a word would do it, I would beg for the strength to withhold the word. And I would have that strength; I am sure of it.” Death, he insisted, is “that gift which makes all other gifts mean and poor.” </p>
<p>He pitied only the living, himself included. When his nephew had died the preceding year he told Jean, “The pathetic sight of the broken-hearted family was a heavy drain upon me and struck me down.” To his sister-in-law, he wrote, “O, fortunate Sam Moffett! fortunate Livy Clemens! doubly fortunate Susy! These swords go through and through my heart, but there is never a moment that I am not glad, for the sake of the dead, that they have escaped.”</p>
<p>The compositions Twain chooses to memorialize his fallen kin are rich with melancholy and sentiment, with refrains appropriate for funeral processions and ample stretches of dark chords played at tempos slow enough for the griever to wallow in. But each also contains unexpected moments of lightness, brief modulations which invite happy memories and gratitude.</p>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://upress.missouri.edu/9780826218278/cosmopolitan-twain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://upress.missouri.edu/9780826218278/cosmopolitan-twain/" target="_blank">As Kerry Driscoll has shown</a>, Twain had a somewhat awkward and anxious relationship to the classical music which was a key ingredient in his wife and daughters’ New England bourgeois education. He was torn between “obligatory genuflection at the alter of high-brow European culture” and the Anglo-American folk tradition of his youth, which represented “the democratic inverse of the grand operatic tradition.” He frequently asserted publicly, with characteristically self-deprecating humor, that he was only fit …</p></div></div></article></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Even in the midst of a global pandemic, the software industry keeps evolving. So I saw no reason not to continue our great Instil tradition, where each December I reflect on emerging trends, and make some foolish predictions.</p>

<h2 id="and-the-oscar-goes-to">And the Oscar Goes To…</h2>

<p>Without question this year’s big winner is TypeScript. 2020 was the year that, as an industry, we woke up to the potential of this type-safe superset of JavaScript. Initially popularised by it’s inclusion in Angular 2, TypeScript received a huge boost by also becoming the default for the AWS Cloud Development Kit. It allows us to write clean, simple code whilst preserving JavaScript’s universal applicability.</p>

<p>At Instil we are huge fans of TypeScript, especially when combined with frameworks like React and Electron. Simply put, it makes JavaScript safer on the client, workable on the server and (in the latest releases) <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/crazy-powerful-typescript-4-1-features-26036f4de6bc">adds FP features that meet or exceed even those offered by Scala and F#</a>. Plus it’s a first-class citizen in emerging JS frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">Deno</a>. What’s not to like?</p>

<p>I see no reason why TypeScript shouldn’t continue to prosper in 2021, and I predict it will win a lot of converts from discontents across the other programming communities. It will be interesting to see how other mainstream languages have to budge up to accommodate this success.</p>

<h2 id="polyglot-and-proud">Polyglot and Proud</h2>

<p>2020 proved beyond a doubt that polyglot programming is the new normal. Rust has established itself as a mainstream language, and the likely successor to C++. Reason, Elm and PureScript continue to pick up supporters, although not enough to give TypeScript any cause for concern. Most notably this was the year Haskell went mainstream, perhaps not as a language for day to day coding, but as the incubator of future coding paradigms and a subject worthy of serious study.</p>

<p>Doubtless these trends will continue in 2021. However I am going to go out on a limb and say that the one language we will be seeing less of is Python. Don’t get me wrong - Python is an awesome language and has been one of our most in demand courses for several years. But we are entering a world where there is a TypeScript API and/or Kotlin DSL for everything, where FP is the default paradigm and where ML is increasingly commoditized in the Cloud.</p>

<p>I believe Python’s recent popularity in part reflects dissatisfaction with the state of other languages and platforms. So, while Python isn’t going anywhere, it’s popularity may have peaked.</p>

<h2 id="fp-ftw">FP FTW!</h2>

<p>Another trend that consolidated itself in 2020 was the acceptance of functional design in software architecture. Admittedly, you’re not going to see the IO Monad and/or Functional Effects libraries popping up outside of Scala or Haskell. But innovations like Hooks in React and Composable Functions in JetPack Compose show how the industry is being pulled in that direction. This is driven by the perennial challenge of managing state in heavily modularized applications that are continually growing more complex and distributed.</p>

<p>We can expect that this trend will continue in 2021 and beyond, especially in the browser. Radical innovation often comes inside a Trojan Horse, such as when LINQ brought FP to C# in 2008 in the guise of SQL. So I predict that Functional Effects will come to the browser in 2021, but not under that name.</p>

<h2 id="the-browser-wars-cooled">The Browser Wars Cooled</h2>

<p>If there’s one place the industry could do with a little less innovation it’s in the browser. Compared to previous years innovation in the browser in 2020 seemed almost sluggish. By unspoken consensus Enterprise Architecture seems to have standardised on either React or Angular, with React continuing to edge slowly ahead.</p>

<p>The new React style (Hooks) won over the developers at Instil this year. It is <a href="https://instil.co/blog/typescript-react-hooks-part-2/">especially powerful when combined with TypeScript</a>. We see this continuing to erode Angular’s market share. Adoption of Redux remains more problematic, but the new Redux Toolkit should help lower the barriers to entry and speed up adoption. Should that fail to float your boat alternatives like MobX and Recoil are available.</p>

<h2 id="the-jvm-and-beyond">The JVM (and Beyond)</h2>

<p>This year has been a success for the Java ecosystem, as ever confounding the doubters with its resilience.</p>

<p>There was good news on a number of fronts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java proved once again to be the old dog that could learn new tricks. Features like records, sealed classes, switch expressions and text blocks showed that the core language could still keep up with its pretenders.</li>
  <li>The continuing adoption of Modules and GraalVM, plus the highly anticipated Loom, offer a path to a leaner, more Cloud friendly VM. This may reverse the trend of companies deciding Java is for legacy projects only.
Now that framework authors are mandating Java 8 or above, there is an increasing acceptance and adoption of functional / reactive designs. This can be seen in Reactive Spring, Quarkus, QuickTheories and even JUnit 5.</li>
  <li>Alternative JVM languages made great progress, both in their core features and satellite frameworks. Kotlin in particular not only completed its dominance of the Android market, but also surged on the server thanks to Ktor, Http4k, Koin, Arrow and, of course, Spring.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two interesting questions to be answered in 2021.</p>

<p>The first is whether the official release of Scala 3 will have any effect on the Java community in general. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIL4mduqHe0&amp;t=6s">Both Kotlin and Scala now have rebuilt compilers, JS and Native versions, powerful tooling support and dedicated frameworks</a>. The new release of Scala is awesome, but we still don’t see it making much of an impact. Ultimately the Kotlin community has proved they can move up the FP complexity ladder as needed, but the Scala community has yet to show they can move down. There remains enough room for everyone, but we don’t see Scala winning new hearts and minds in 2021.</p>

<p>The second question is whether Kotlin will succeed in its bid to be the multiplatform language of the industry. In late 2019 the Kotlin team started to make a huge deal of their support for multiplatform libraries, which would enable the same code to be shared across Java, Swift, C++ and JavaScript codebases. This year we saw <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/11/gitlive-case-study-kotlin-multiplatform-across-desktop-and-mobile/">a number of successful case studies using this technology</a>.</p>

<p>The meteoric rise of TypeScript will be an issue here. But if the Kotlin team can continue to refine their <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat">Dukat</a> interoperability tool, and perhaps add features like Algebraic Types to the core language, then there is no reason why they should not succeed. Kotlin, TypeScript and Rust could then become the three essential languages for the next decade.</p>

<h2 id="serverless">Serverless</h2>

<p>Of course no discussion of 2020 would be complete without Cloud Computing, and Serverless in particular. We now see all our clients shifting to some form of Serverless, with AWS keeping the top spot for another year running. Standardisation on the Cloud Development Kit and emerging best practises (such as <a href="https://cdkpatterns.com/">the CDK Patterns</a>) should keep AWS in the top spot.</p>

<p>That being said we hear very good reports from those working on Azure and Google Cloud, especially as regards how simple and friendly the experience is for developers. So it wouldn’t take much for an industry as fickle as ours to anoint a new king.</p>

<p>I’m going to stick my neck out again and say that Multi-Cloud is inevitable. Not for technical reasons, nor because anyone wants it, but because that’s the reality of business. Companies grow as much through mergers and acquisitions as by expanding their existing customer base. So as Serverless applications become legacy (i.e. working and earning revenue) a successful company will be incentivised to keep the systems they acquire running, regardless of platform.</p>

<p>I predict the resulting situation will be like the .NET vs. JEE wars in the 2000’s, where initially an IT department was ‘either fish or fowl’ - but market forces soon drove them to be both.</p>

<h2 id="work-rest-and-play">Work, Rest and Play</h2>

<p>In previous years these articles have only ever been concerned with technology trends. But 2020 required radical changes to our everyday routines, and it’s only natural to ponder how much of this change will become permanent.</p>

<p>In a sense, 2020 only accelerated us down a road we were already on. Instil, like many other software providers, was already participating in distributed team-working for a range of clients worldwide. We had an existing policy of working from home and distributed pairing was happening daily.</p>

<p>As an industry we had the tools, experience and motivation to take what had been a novelty and make it the daily reality for developers worldwide. The same applied to conferences, training and meetups - a personal journey for myself which <a href="https://syncni.com/interview/5126/garth-gilmour-how-instil-s-training-has-survived-in-2020">I have discussed in detail elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>My ‘hot take’ is that many of these changes will stay with us forever. Developers have learned to make good use of the hours they would normally spend commuting, and project managers will be loath to lose that productivity. In many industries the only thing that was preventing teams from embracing distributed workflows was the fear of the unknown. Now we have been pushed past that fear, few will be inclined to make a case to turn the clock back.</p>

<p>I don’t think that offices will vanish, but will instead function more like conference centres and business incubators do today. They will be ‘drop in centres’ where you spend a couple of days a week on the most important meetings and the trickiest problems. But the rest of your time will be remote.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>When I write these articles there is often a sense of ‘everything changes and everything stays the same’. This year is no different. Taking the long view it has been quite a while since we had a major platform shift, as happened with VM’s, web apps, mobile and Cloud. There are huge changes at work for certain, but they are happening in small increments under the surface with the odd lurch. A bit like plate tectonics. WebAssembly has the potential to shake things up tremendously, especially when combined with Rust, but it never quite seems to reach critical momentum.</p>

<h3>Daily Volumes</h3>



<p>Let’s start by using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clarusft.com/products/data/ccpview/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.clarusft.com/products/data/ccpview/" target="_blank">CCPView </a>to look at the <a href="https://www.clarusft.com/glossary/cleared/" title="Glossary: Cleared" data-cmtooltip="Trades that are Cleared by a Clearing House, which steps in the middle of a bi-lateral trade and novates this, such that the Clearing House acts a s a Central Counterparty (CCP) to guarantee performance from each of the two parties to the trade." target="_blank">cleared</a> volume, which shows that only 9 days in the past 3 months had any volume.</p>

<p>Showing that clearing of Credit Index Options is still in it’s infancy.</p>



<h3>Open Interest in Credit Derivatives</h3>



<p>Let’s take a look at cleared credit derivatives by currency and product type using <a href="https://www.clarusft.com/glossary/open-interest/" title="Glossary: Open Interest" data-cmtooltip="Open Interest, or &quot;OI&quot;, is generally a futures concept referring to the number of contracts outstanding. &nbsp;If party A buys 1 contract from party B, the open interest in that contract is 1. &nbsp;It is becoming common as well in OTC derivatives clearing, also referred to as Notional Outstanding." target="_blank">open interest</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Credit Indices in EUR the largest with $870 billion or €720 billion </li><li>Credit Indices in USD next with $510 billion</li><li>Single name <a href="https://www.clarusft.com/glossary/cds/" title="Glossary: CDS" data-cmtooltip="Credit Default Swap" target="_blank">CDS</a> in USD with $475 billion</li><li>Single name CDS in EUR with $440 billion or  €365 billion</li><li>Credit Indices in JPY with $28 billion</li><li>Single name CDS in JPY with $12 billion</li><li>Credit Index Options in EUR with $3.4 billion or €2.8 billion</li><li>Credit Index Options in USD with $110 million</li></ul>



<p>Meaning that for Credit Index Options in EUR (ITraxx) the open interest is only 0.4% of the Index itself, suggesting that there is a lot of room for growth. </p>



<p>Bi-lateral Credit Index Options are subject to Uncleared <a href="https://www.clarusft.com/glossary/margin/" title="Glossary: Margin" data-cmtooltip="General term for the collateral or funds charged by Clearing Houses (or other counterparties) to cover the default risk of a counterparties trade or portfolio of trades.&nbsp; Margin tends to be called in the form of liquid collateral (cash or bonds).&nbsp; Forms of Margin requirements are Initial Margin (IM) and Variation Margin (VM)." target="_blank">Margin</a> and if these are delta-hedged with the Index as a cleared trade, then the delta component of SIMM will be significant and act as an incentive to clear the option trade.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see if Credit Index Options volumes increase significantly in 2021.</p>



<p>The recent launches by ICE and LCH suggests their is interest from market participants.</p>



<h3>Open Interest by Clearing Service</h3>



<p>Before we end, let’s look at the above chart by split by Clearing Service.</p>

<p>The year 2015 brought more than just capital controls to Greece, one of the changes being the rise of electronic payments. I still remember the criticism raised by a politician at a conference hosted by the Hilton, an iconic hotel in Athens, in connection with how cash is perceived by an average Greek citizen. He frowned upon keeping cash “<em>under a mattress</em>“, completely disregarding the public sentiment that banks were unreliable during those times. He strongly recommended that paying with a card or electronically would be the rational choice, as banks would have larger deposits at their disposal allowing them to function more efficiently. Along with other benefits, tax evasion would be diminished. An everyday transaction involving cash may take place without the issuance of a receipt, whereas electronic transactions require an authentication process which is also reflected on a mandatory receipt. Not much difference is seen if a case is isolated to one individual buying a bottle of water from a kiosk without a receipt. When the scenario is repeated thousands of times by thousands of individuals, however, the loss is significant.</p>



<p>This article is based on the information contained in the report released <strong><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf">by the European Central Bank regarding the perspective of the Digital Euro</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Although the aforementioned statement sounded outrageous at the time, which is completely justifiable, that is exactly the direction towards which Greece has been heading, along with the rest of the Eurozone. In fact, the amount of electronic payments has more than tripled between the years 2014 and 2017<sup>1</sup>. Paying with your, mostly debit, card has become a habit and vendors do no longer roll their eyes because they have to boot the POS machine; it is already powered, linked and waiting. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the cryptocurrency and stablecoin markets warn us that private actors, once again, may evolve into a threat to financial stability of the Europe Union and its broader economy. As a statement of innovation and a reflex of defence, numerous countries are developing their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Digital Euro is one of them, with a special European Task Force unit working on this project since January of this year. Moreover, the process of the development is accelerated by the changing behaviour of consumers within the environment Covid-19 pandemic. Despite lack of decisive evidence, people do believe that cash may be contaminated with the virus, as it has always been previously associated with carrying dirt, microbes and even particles of drugs. At the same time, given that the movement of individuals is restricted due to lockdowns, it is only natural that more and more people get acquainted with e-commerce.</p>



<p><span><strong>What the Digital Euro isn’t<br></strong></span>When we order from Amazon, we do not launch a dollar bill paper towards Jeff Bezos’ direction. We use debit cards, credit cards and electronic payment solutions, such as Paypal. Hence, while we already use electronic money, third parties and intermediaries are involved with different standards and procedures. This pathway of transactions mostly involve commercial bank deposits or a third party wallet. The digital euro is not linked to a bank deposit which you can access with e-banking. The digital euro is a separate European “wallet”, which will also act as a complementary payment solution to the already existing third party infrastructure. This will further propel the digitalization of economy and fill existing gaps, efficiently making transactions faster.</p>

The digital euro might just do the trick.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The digital euro isn’t a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ether, either. Traditional currencies are established by laws marking the government’s and the state’s central bank approval. The citizens have “<em>signed</em>” a social contract with the sovereign whose monetary “<em>organ</em>” guarantees the value of the banknotes, despite them being made of paper. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have been created by private individuals, a decentralized <em>sui generis</em> social contract which does not involve the a state or a central authority. What’s more to that, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a tangible commodity, such as gold, either. Its trustworthiness stems from the so called “blockchain” technology ensuring fairness and a balance between privacy and transparency in this agreement between the holders (“<em><span>I do not know who Mr.Sunshine69 is but looking at his transaction history I can see he is a shady one.</span></em>“) The idea of this peer to peer currency is considered innovative, to the extent that Gavin Andersen, one of the closest people to the core of Bitcoin’s creation had received an invitation by the US CIA, with a view to gain a better understanding on whether Bitcoin actually posed any threat to US government institutions<sup>2</sup>. Even if the creation of Bitcoin was, in fact, benign, there is still a legitimate concern that it will still act as a risk factor.</p>



<p>What appears even more worrisome is the development of Stablecoins (Global Stablecoins or GSC). This form of currency is closer to traditional money, as a Stablecoin is actually backed by fiat currencies or baskets of fiat currencies and securities which act as a diversified portfolio. While the digital Euro is not a Stablecoin either, one of its purposes is to potentially protect the Eurozone from the latter’s economic footprint.</p>



<p>First of all, as some forms of Stablecoins are linked to currencies other than euro. During times of panic individuals may perceive foreign currencies as more stable ones and acquire Stablecoins as a gateway. Hence, if the stablecoin is linked to foreign assets, depending on the location of the GSC desk, that could result into capital outflows. Secondly, if stablecoins were to become a popular means of payment or store of value, that would create a new channel of risk transmission, making real economic activity and financial stability more vulnerable. For example, the consequences of monetary and fiscal policies are harder to predict and thus manage. It feels much like shooting a ray of light in a cylinder full of mirrors. Finally, if a GSC is used as a substitute to the euro, that would undermine Eurozone’s monetary sovereignty and efficiency.</p>



<p><span>What the Digital Euro is <br></span>Having pointed out what the Digital Euro isn’t, the easiest way to describe it is: <em>a digital sum of money readily available to citizens, without the existence of an intermediary, such as a bank or a third party wallet, while pursuing the status of legal tender</em>. As it is expected of it, however, even when a currency is a mirror image of its cash form, there are still some precautions to take and problems to tackle. The simplest of all being the fact that not all people are ‘<em>tech savvy</em>’. Confusion could foster financial exclusion, a manifestation of social exclusion and a phenomenon linked to poverty. Creating an inclusive user experience, matching the needs of already marginalized parts of society, is an important provision which could greatly supported by clear explanations and behavioural science.</p>



<p>Another problem is related to bank liquidity. By using digital euro wallets as an alternative to commercial bank deposits, banking institutions will have less money to manage. Subsequently, interest on loans provided by bank could rise, slowing down the economy. Some other problems would be created in the event that too many (or too rich) individuals outside the Eurozone started investing heavily in the digital euro. The balance sheet of the Eurosystem would be largely increased, while the euro could become very expensive relative to foreign currencies (foreign exchange rate). While a stronger currency is beneficial for cheaper imports, it may harm the ability of businesses to export, as their products will become more expensive when expressed in dollars, for example. This would, again, limit the ability of these enterprises to pay off their debts to the commercial banks, exacerbating problems related to liquidity.</p>



<p>One must not forget that the Euro is also a symbol. It is no coincidence that we see no faces on the euro banknotes. Although metal coins do have specialized depictions of each country’s historic personalities, expressing sovereignty and nationalism, one will observe bridges, gates and windows symbolizing unity and communication on the banknotes. In the relevant report, the European Central Bank stresses out that it does not want the symbolic value of the tangible currency to fade. After all, if displayed in the form of digital euro, we will likely be seeing our budget as the sum and the app interface.</p>

<p>Symbols are important and they introduce us to another big chapter of problems with the digital euro: reputation. One of the main reasons that the EU wants the digital Euro to have the status of legal tender, is to make sure it does not get its, potentially, bad name from Cryptocurrencies. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the majority of population started calling it “<em>European Bitcoin</em>”, despite it having no relevance to the Bitcoin whatsoever. Another thing to be avoided is the association of the digital Euro with the funding of terrorism, drug trade and illicit activities in general. While Euro in its cash form is undeniably being used for purposes of this nature, as any other major currency, what the ECB wants to avoid is creating loopholes, legal or technical, which could facilitate such funding.</p>



<p>Externally, the Eurozone deems the extensive use of a digital Euro abroad undesirable, especially if it is used as a currency substitution method by unstable economies. Despite the benefits of holding the euro, as opposed to a weak domestic currency, lets say, cursed with incontrollable inflation, the monetary authority of that country has now even less control on a macro level. Eventually the blame could be shifted towards the European …</p></div></div>

<li>Customer Experience Statistics</li>
<li>Customer Retention Statistics</li>
<li>Customer Satisfaction Statistics</li>
<li>Customer Relationship Management Statistics </li>

<h2>Customer Service Statistics</h2>
<p>The following statistics on customer service will help you to brainstorm new strategies for strengthening your customer service team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers are willing to spend <strong>17%</strong> <strong>more</strong> on a company that has outstanding customer service. <strong>(<a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/press-release/wellactually-americans-say-customer-service-better-ever">American Express</a>)</strong></li>

<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Customer Experience Statistics</h2>
<p>1One thing that is making customer experience more important than ever is the fact that consumer trust is declining across all industries . With growing distrust around issues like data, brands need to do what they can to ensure that CX at every touchpoint is delivering in order to build trust with their customers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*1yi-vq0KZGMRoIyZIDCqlA.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>Only <strong>22%</strong> of consumers think mobile experience is good.<a href="https://experiencematters.blog/2017/05/01/report-state-of-cx-management-2017/">**(Temkin Group)</a>**</li>

</ol>
<h2>Customer Retention Statistics</h2>
<p>Here are some fantastic customer loyalty and retention statistics that may surprise you </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*klkXNobs_GLTbVqfqUEPBQ.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9 out of 10</strong> consumers value when a business knows their account history and current activities with that company. <strong>(<a href="https://genbin.genesys.com/media/Genesys-CX-Report-FINAL_06112018.pdf">Genesys</a>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>37%</strong> of consumers say that it takes 5️⃣ or more purchases for them to consider themselves loyal to a brand. <strong>(<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/purchases-brand-loyalty/">Yotpo</a>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>50%</strong> of customers naturally churn every 5 years. However, only 1 out of 26 😒 unhappy customers complain; the rest simply churn. <strong>(<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ekolsky/cx-for-executives">Kolsky</a>)</strong></li>
<li>U.S. companies lose <strong>$136.8 billion</strong> per year due to avoidable consumer switching. <strong>(<a href="https://learn.callminer.com/whitepapers/callminerindex-us-consumers-switch-by-sector">CallMiner</a>)</strong></li>

</ul>
<h2><em>Customer Satisfaction Statistic</em>s</h2>
<p>Customer Satisfaction is usually measured by 3️⃣ metrics -</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Promoter Score(NPS)</li>
<li>Customer Satisfaction Score(CSAT) </li>
<li>Customer Effort Score(CES)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*j-YwDm84W99K8F16cFxl-g.png" alt="Customer Satisfaction Metrics"></p>
<p>Let’s us take a brief look upon them :</p>
<h3>NPS :</h3>
<p>Net Promoter Score  was designed to measure customer experience and predict its impact on the future of the company. NPS consists of 2 questions, allowing to get both quantitative and qualitative data about customers’ feelings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The NPS <strong>statistic</strong> falls between -100 <strong>and 100</strong>, with a <strong>score</strong> of -100 signifying that everyone in your sample is a <strong>detractor</strong>, and a <strong>score</strong> of 💯 signifying that everyone in your sample is a <strong>promoter</strong>. A <strong>score</strong> greater than signifies that there are more promoters than detractors, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CSAT :</h3>
<p>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is an indication of customer happiness. It’s usually based on a short survey that customers fill out, typically after a conversation or ticket is resolved. This survey can take many different forms, but at its core asks the customer to rate their experience on a scale ranging from good/great to bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CSAT is calculated by dividing all the positive responses by the total number of responses and multiplying by 100. This results in your CSAT percent . For eg., if you have 35 positive responses and a total of 50 responses, your CSAT would be 70%.</p>
<p><strong>(#) positive responses / (#) total responses X 100 = (%) CSAT</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>CES :</h3>
<p>The customer effort score is an index from <strong>1 to 7</strong> that measures how easy a company makes it for customers to deal with its products and services.
It is  used to measure customer satisfaction levels 😠 😐 😃 by focusing on the efforts customers make to interact with your business’ services and products.</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher a company’s CES, the happier their customers will be. According to CEB, moving a customer from a <strong>1 to a 5</strong> <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/unveiling-the-new-and-improved-customer-effort-score/">boosts their loyalty by <strong>22%.</strong></a>Though moving someone from a <strong>5 to a 7</strong> increases their loyalty by only <strong>2%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Customer Relationship Management Statistics</em></h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about investing in a CRM for your sales team, these CRM stats pulled from independent research studies might convince you to take the plunge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering mobile CRM access does not just increase use of the software, but also the productivity of the workforce. Statistics from <a href="https://go.forrester.com/"><strong>Forester</strong></a> have shown that <strong>50% of teams improved their productivity by using a mobile CRM.</strong></li>
<li>CRM software revenues <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-04-10-gartner-says-crm-became-the-largest-software-market-in-2017-and-will-be-the-fastest-growing-software-market-in-2018#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%202017,%2C%20according%20to%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.">have overtaken database management systems</a> to become the largest of all software markets. And with revenues <strong>expected to reach over $80 billion by 2025</strong>, it’s no surprise that CRM is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/customer-relationship-management-crm-market">the fastest growing software market</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Salesforce</strong> is the leading CRM vendor with <strong>19.5%</strong> of the CRM market share <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-06-17-gartner-says-worldwide-customer-experience-and-relati">(<strong>gartner</strong>)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9dUHt3Hr94VrRLmUNfF05g.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>CRM revenues are expected to reach over <strong>$80 billion</strong> 💰in <strong>2025.</strong></li>
<li><strong>One-third</strong> of CRM users spend from <strong>3–5 hrs per week</strong> using CRM, while <strong>24%</strong> spend more than <strong>10 hrs per week .  <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/sales-solutions/resources/pdfs/linkedin-state-of-sales-2016-report.pdf">(LinkedIn)</a></strong></li>
<li>Research tells us that the most effective sales organizations are <strong>81%</strong> more likely to practice consistent usage of their CRM system. <strong>(Source: Aberdeen Group)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Customer Behaviour Statistics</em></h2>
<p>Whether your area of speciality is social media, mobile marketing, paid search or just about any other marketing discipline, all of your efforts should start by analysing the wants, needs and behaviours of your consumer 👀</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>87%</strong> Of Shoppers now begin product searches online <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/87-of-shoppers-now-begin-product-searches-online/530139/"><strong>(retaildive)</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>82%</strong> Of Consumers expect an immediate response to Sales Or Marketing Question <strong>(<a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/07/real-time-response-to-customers.html">smallbiztrends)</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>67%</strong> Of Customers prefer self-service over speaking to a Company Representative <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/searching-for-self-service/"><strong>(zendesk)</strong>.</a></li>
<li>By <strong>2021</strong>, The Number Of Voice Assistant Users Will Reach <strong>122.7</strong> Million <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/voice-assistant-use-reaches-critical-mass"><strong>(emarketer)</strong></a>.</li>

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/bye-social-media/cover.jpg"></p>

<p><span>N</span>ot long ago, we lived in small hunter-gatherer tribes. Social skills evolved along our abilities to use physical tools and language. We spent our days hunting or foraging our food, and had plenty of free time to ponder life. Our survival was dependent upon our social skills. We were rewarded (by the fruits of cooperation) for having friends and social support, and killed (mostly by hunger or predators) if we were antisocial. Our brains developed to be very sensitive to social interactions. The ability to read other’s emotions, give them importance, and respond to them is a part of our hard-wired social brain. It also takes a lot of mental energy.</p>

<p>In the early days of social media, I was (as is usual with me) an avid promoter and ethusiast. Social media is just <em>amazing</em> for so many things: exploring ideas, being up to date with many topics, connecting with tons of people. Social media helped me bootstrap my professional life, and meet some of the most amazing people. However, I’ve now come to believe that in a couple of years, most people will view using social media as unhealthy, like we do today with smoking. We might need to find better ways to get these benefits withtout the costs.</p>

<p>I stopped using Facebook ~3 years ago, and Instagram ~2 years ago. My online life has been much better since. My offline life too. Today (actually,&nbsp;a month ago), I left Twitter. The costs are simply too high for me. I noticed the less I use any of those apps, the calmer my mind, the more I read, and the more time I spend outside, in real contact with other people and nature. These are things I value more than instant access to news and daily contact with thousands of people at this time.</p>

<p>It is very hard to argue that social media is not harmful for most. We are simply not made to continually know what everyone else is doing or thinking, all the time! And it’s not a neutral tech. It is actively addictive and destructive to our volition. Most of the people I’ve talked to say they’d like to use these apps less. Yet somehow they don’t. Our brains are wired to pay attention to each other and to care about what others think about us. Social media is designed to exploit both these things. It is engineered to hook us in, and to influence our behavior. That’s the product Facebook, Instagram and Twitter sell to their customers: changing your ideas and behavior. And they got some pretty talented people working on that.</p>

<p>I don’t really think I can convince anyone to leave social media. I don’t even think it’s bad for everyone or that the benefits can’t outweigh the costs for some. I’m writing this post because many of you will already be close to leaving one of these apps. You’ve been thinking about it already. You’ve already made up your mind about it, and you’re waiting for the right moment. If just one person makes the final step into at least <em>trying</em> to live without social media, I’ll be happy.&nbsp;It has made a huge change for me. If you think this is stupid or I don’t understand the beauty of the Internet, I think you’ll change your mind in a few years. Or social media will ;)</p>

<p>If you do leave social media, feel free to contact me after a couple of months to share experiences. It’s been amazing for me, and I’m not going back. I’m really interested in knowing more about how this change can affect other people’s life. I’m also curious to find new ways to stay in touch with people outside my local community which are less toxic to my mind.</p>

<p>To close this brief post, I’ll share a bold prediction (and hope) on this topic: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will have less monthly active users in 2025 than today (~2.6 billion, ~1 billion, ~330 million, respectively). I added this to my <a href="https://maraoz.com/2016/03/20/2026/">predictions for 2026 post</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In the last post I said that I just started my MSc in health informs. The first semester has five modules, one of those modules is about object oriented programming.</p>
<p>The object oriented programming module starts with introduction to programming, mathematics in programming, flow charts and pseudo codes.</p>
<p>When I was going through past papers one question caught my eye, at a glance it looks like an easy question, but the more you look at it, the difficult it gets.</p>
<h2><strong>Write a pseudo code to input five names and arrange them in alphabetical order</strong></h2>
<p>Looks simple enough right? But what about names that start with the same letter? The differentiating letter can be the second, third or nth letter.</p>
<p>Even though the question asks for five names, a good algorithm should be able to tackle hundreds or thousands of names.</p>
<h2>Approaches</h2>
<p>Some of my colleagues suggested a method that was about brute forcing.</p>
<ul><li>First check the first letter a word (n)</li><li>Then check the first letter of the second word (n+1)</li><li>If the first letter of the n+1 word is lesser than the nth word then swap them</li><li>Now check n against n+2</li><li>Continue until the first letter of a word is greater than that of the first letter of the nth word</li><li>Now repeat the same process for n+1, n+2 word and so on</li></ul>
<p>Even though this approach can be good for small number of words, the complexity can increase faster with the addition of each word than the total number of words.</p>
<h2><strong>Trying</strong> <strong>the</strong> bucket sort approach</h2>
<p>I had a hunch that there should be a better way, I knew on the back of my mind, that there has to be a better method. Plus I had to make a proof of concept working code for a different method.</p>
<p>After trying different approaches I came across this Wikipedia article about bucket sort, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort</a></p>
<p>This was my approach </p>
<ul><li>Generate 26 empty buckets, one bucket representing each letter of the alphabet </li><li>Start with first letter of each word</li><li>Loop though each word and assign a bucket according to the first letter of each word</li><li>Now loop through the 26 buckets, if the bucket contains only one word then add that to the output</li><li>If there is more than one word, then repeat the same process but now starting with the second letter of the word and so on</li></ul>
<h2>The <strong>pseudo code</strong> </h2>
<pre>BEGIN
&nbsp; Get names as array
&nbsp; Output sort(names, 0)

&nbsp; Begin function sort(names, indent) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set buckets = empty 26 arrays
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set output&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every name in names
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Set char = char value of first letter-97
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set bucket[char] = name
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End for

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For every bucket in buckets
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If bucket has only one value
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Add that to output
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Else if more than one
             Indent += 1
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sort(bucket)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End if
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End for
&nbsp; &nbsp; Return output
&nbsp; End function
END</pre>
<h2><strong>Working</strong> code</h2>
<p>I’ve made the simple example of this algorithm using JavaScript. Even though the module was taught in Java, since Java arrays are fixed in length, I found difficulties in implementing this code in Java.</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">const names = ["ruky" , "nethmi", "janith" , "rukmal", "sahan" , "rukshan"]

console.log(createBuckets(names, 0))
function createBuckets(names, indent) {
   const buckets = []   const output =  []
   var n = 0   while(n&lt;=26){
     buckets[n] = []
     n++
   }
   for (var i = 0; i &lt;= names.length-1; i++) {
      var char = names[i].charCodeAt(indent)-97
      buckets[char].push(names[i])
   }
   for (var i = 0; i &lt;= buckets.length-1; i++) {
     if(buckets[i].length &gt; 1) {
       const tempOutput = createBuckets(buckets[i],indent+1)
       for (var o=0; o &lt;= tempOutput.length-1;o++) {
         if (tempOutput[o].length === 1) output.push(tempOutput[o])
       }
     } else if (buckets[i].length === 1) {
       output.push(buckets[i])
     }
   }
   return output
}</code></pre>
<p>You can see the code in the following bin <a href="https://jsbin.com/jilotavocu/edit?js,console">https://jsbin.com/jilotavocu/edit?js,console</a></p>
<h2><strong>Limitations</strong> </h2>
<p>This algorithm has following limitations, it will throw an error when there duplicates.</p>
<p>I haven’t put a failsafe method to check for duplicates. But it’s fairly simple to implement, and I think the pseudo code is more than enough to get majority of the marks, and it’s also better than brute forcing. Also better to arrange large number of words.</p>
<p>Do you have a better implementation? I’d love to know.</p>

                    <p>In my last blog post, I have written about how to turn a Raspberry Pi into a serverless platform with the lightweight <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaa</a>S implementation <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>. If you haven't checked it out already, you can find the link to the post below: </p><figure><a href="https://myedes.io/serverless-on-raspberrypi/"><div><p>Turn your Raspberry Pi into a serverless platform with faasd</p><p>Build a lightweight serverless platform on your Raspberry Pi with OpenFaas’ faasd and deploy your first function.</p><p><img src="https://myedes.io/favicon.ico"><span>Mehdi Yedes' blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://myedes.io/content/images/2020/02/faasd-post-image-1.jpg"></p></a></figure><blockquote>Please note that a Raspberry Pi is not required here.<br>faasd can be installed without issues on any other machine or cloud instance as well. <br>This blog post from Alex Ellis describes how to build a faasd serverless appliance on DigitalOcan: <br><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/deploy-serverless-faasd-with-cloud-init/">https://blog.alexellis.io/deploy-serverless-faasd-with-cloud-init/</a></blockquote><p>I did that only as a small hobby project. But then, I wanted to use this setup for a real-world use case, and also use the opportunity to try another useful open-source project which is <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">inlets</a>.</p><p>Inlets is a cloud native tunnel that allows you to expose private endpoints to the Internet. In this case, it will be used to expose the OpenFaaS gateway running on my Raspberry Pi board to receive incoming Stripe Webhook events and dispatch them to the relevant function.</p><blockquote>For more details about inlets, check the official docs and resources available at <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">https://docs.inlets.dev/</a> &nbsp;</blockquote><p>So in this post, I will describe how I built a local OpenFaaS function that serves as a Stripe webhook. This function &nbsp;simply sends a Slack notification for every new <code>charge.succeeded</code> event.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h2><figure><img src="https://myedes.io/content/images/2020/03/stripe-slack-notifier-2.png"><figcaption>Pictured: conceptual architecture with faasd for functions, inlets for the tunnel and stripe to generate webhooks.</figcaption></figure><p>Inlets is an open source HTTP tunnel which we can use to get a public IP address to receive webhooks. The inlets client will be running on the Raspberry Pi and connects to the inlets server using a websocket connection to listen for any incoming requests. </p><p>In our setup, every Stripe webhook event that is received by the inlets client will be forwarded to the OpenFaaS gateway on the Raspberry Pi, which will in turn trigger the <code>stripe-slack-notifier</code> function to send a new Slack notification.</p><h2 id="preparing-the-setup">Preparing the Setup</h2><h3 id="obtain-an-exit-node-with-inlets">Obtain an exit node with inlets</h3><p>First, make sure you have created an inlets exit server following this nice guide by Alex Ellis:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/https-inlets-local-endpoints/"><div><p>Get HTTPS for your local endpoints with inlets and Caddy</p><p>Learn how to get incoming HTTP traffic for webhooks, events and for serving websites and APIs from your local network and computer with inlets and Caddy.</p><p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/favicon.ico"><span>Alex Ellis</span><span>Alex Ellis' Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/03/clouds-coconut-trees-daytime-1168764.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>This would allow you to have an exit node with a public domain that can be used for receiving webhook events. In the setup described earlier, the inlets client is running on the Raspberry Pi, so I have chosen the upstream to be <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/">http://127.0.0.1:8080</a>, which is the OpenFaaS Gateway URL.</p><p>Using the token provided by the inlets server, the command below exposes the OpenFaaS Gateway to the Internet:</p><pre><code>$ inlets client --remote wss://${REMOTE_EXIT_NODE} --upstream http://127.0.0.1:8080 --token ${INLETS_TOKEN}</code></pre><p>Our function will then be available from the Internet using the <code>https://${REMOTE_EXIT_NODE}/function/stripe-slack-notifier</code></p><h3 id="add-a-stripe-webhook">Add a Stripe Webhook</h3><p>We need to add a new Stripe webhook using the </p><figure><img src="https://myedes.io/content/images/2020/03/stripe-webhook-1.png"></figure><h3 id="create-a-slack-app">Create a Slack App</h3><p>To receive incoming webhooks we need to create an App in the Slack dashboard.</p><figure><img src="https://myedes.io/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-from-2020-03-31-19-49-49.png"></figure><h2 id="create-a-function-to-receive-webhooks-from-stripe">Create a function to receive webhooks from Stripe</h2><p>The function <code>stripe-slack-notifier</code> was built using the <code>python3-http</code> template that is available in the OpenFaaS template store.</p><p>Creating a new function using <code>faas-cli new</code></p><pre><code>$ faas-cli template store list | grep python3-http

On Linux, we need to register other platforms like <code>armv7</code> with the kernel using the <code>docker/binfmt</code> image:</p><pre><code>$ docker run --privileged --rm docker/binfmt:a7996909642ee92942dcd6cff44b9b95f08dad64</code></pre><p> 3. &nbsp; Create a new builder for buildx</p><pre><code>$ docker buildx create --name armhf --platform linux/arm/v7

    <p>This <a href="https://github.com/13-37-org/infnoise/issues/15#issuecomment-453848323">comment</a> in a Github issue conversation is an example of the surprise
that the user experiences when they didn’t realize their actions in some other
part of the system triggered automatic closure of the issue.</p>

<p>He pushed a commit to the Git repository with the title ‘fix #15: …’, and
Github took the liberty of automatically closing the issue. The user caught this
mistake (he didn’t intend to close the issue), and reopened it.</p>

<p>This is Gihub’s default behaviour, and AFAIK there’s no way to disable this
behaviour. If you push a commit to Github that starts with ‘fix #ID:’, Github
will close that issue in your repository.</p>

<p>The lesson for me here is that design software with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">POLA</a> in mind.
Specifically, don’t make the software take actions unless the customer
explicitly either takes that action, or approves that action.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1628185">
    
      <div><p>This site was named after the idea that we need to face
unpleasant facts. In some ways, it is named after a quote from George Orwellâ€™s<a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/">
Why I Write</a>.</p>

<p><i>â€œI knew that I had a facility with words and a power of
facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world
in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life.â€�</i></p>

<p>Now, I lack Orwellâ€™s facility with words, but I have always
thought that my ability to face and discuss unpleasant facts as an asset. After
encountering <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf">Nick
Bostromâ€™s work on information hazards</a>, I am less certain that this is the
case. According to Bostrom, an information hazard is:</p>

<p><i>A risk that arises from the dissemination or the
potential dissemination of (true) information that may cause harm or enable
some agent to cause harm</i></p>

<p>One basic example of this dynamic is that once people know
that nuclear bombs or certain bioweapons are possible, some agents who might
cause harm might figure out how to make these for themselves. For the world at
large, the advancement of science and spread of scientific knowledge is not
always good like we assume it is.</p>

<p>Bostromâ€™s paper does a good job categorizing different types
of hazards, but I want to focus on how individuals might use the concept of
information hazards. An example of a potential information hazard is if a
person would be much happier never knowing their partner cheated on them. It is
only an information hazard if they could have lived their life happily having
never known that their partner was unfaithful. If they would have found out eventually
when other people laughed at them for it, or if they got an STD, genetically
tested their children, or if their partner then leaves them for their mistress
then the revelation is just getting bad news earlier and giving the person more
time to adjust for it, which is not an information hazard.</p>

<p>On an individual level, one way to frame this is the classic
Matrix dilemma, where Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to take the red pill and
see reality for what it is or take the blue pill and go back to believing
everything is normal. Many people immediately think the red pill is the obvious
option, but after taking the red pill they can no longer relate to their
previous friends. And worse, having taken the red pill Neo made enemies of immensely
powerful people.</p>

<p>Information hazards are not necessarily about red vs blue,
as taking the red pill might give you superpowers. But sometimes it is more
like a black pill that might give you a slightly more accurate understanding of
how the world works but saps your motivation to effectively navigate it.</p>

<p>Social media is a way information hazards get spread in the
world. One example that applies to everyone who uses social media: We know
intellectually that people have horrible views. But in todayâ€™s world, more and
more people are saying offensive things in ways that can spread online. When a partisan
commentator is highlighting how some random person on the other team is
saying ridiculous thing about the world, a practice often referred to as nut-picking,
their partisan fans become less inclined to interact in good faith with anyone
on the other side. Everyone is worse off because they were exposed to true but unrepresentative information about how some people see the world.</p><p>It might be helpful to think through a few more scenarios.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that makes you unpopular</i></p>

<p>One type of knowledge that is often more than useless is
knowledge that makes you unpopular. It might be fun to be the one to tell your
classmates that Santa Claus is not real, but they will not like you for it.
Similarly, knowing something is false when your colleagues ardently believe in
it can be dangerous for anyone with a predisposition for correcting others.</p>

<p><i>An accurate vision of a future point in time without
considering the paths that will lead there</i>.</p>

<p>There have been many economic bubbles, and not participating
early on has always been the wrong choice from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation where people are getting excited about a
technology, but the pessimist who is interested in the area knows that it will
not be viable for another decade while others in the field insist that success
is a couple years around the corner. If they decide not to join or invest in a
group of otherwise very smart people working on this problem, they will miss
out on working with people at the cutting edge of what they are doing. And
their business venture might still be a success if they can convince someone
else to buy their company, whether it is public market investors or a CEO who wants
their company to have exposure to the cool new technology. They could buy it
early on even if numbers do not add up. And the pessimist could have been right
about the timeline and the fundamental economics but still miss out massively
by not joining that initial team. </p>

<p><i>Knowing that a problem is really hard</i></p>

<p>Similarly, industry insiders often miss out on new ideas
that remake their industry because they are too aware of the little details
that new solutions do not address. Knowing other details, they fail to appreciate
what can be built on top of new technologies.</p>

<p><i>Understanding that what they are doing is not helping the
world (or their customers).</i></p>

<p>It is debatable as to whether this is a true information
hazard for the world at large. But from an organizationâ€™s or individualâ€™s
perspective, if they or their employees switch from believing they are helping the world towards
believing they are a negative force then morale will take a hit and there will
be less productivity. Like bad news about infidelity, this is not an
information hazard if there are effective paths that resolve the issues. But if an
employee is naÃ¯ve enough to put information about the problems into an email,
it could later be used as evidence against the company.</p>

<p>Googleâ€™s quest to keep all mention of antitrust related
phrases out of any written communications is an example where explicit knowledge
of market dominance is effectively an information hazard.</p>

<p><i>When team members understand that they are not aligned
with the firm.</i></p>

<p>Many organizations have incentives set up that allow for abuse by clever employees.
When people understand these mismatching incentives, the organization can suffer. If one of
the employees notices a misalignment and does
not think before they point it out publicly, they might not be helping the company or themselves. Now other
employees might be tempted to take advantage of the loophole and some people in management might resent them for bringing up the issue in the first place when things weren't broken before they mentioned the problem.</p>

<p><i>Complete knowledge of costs, incomplete knowledge of
communication norms</i></p>

<p>Letâ€™s say that a project manager knows certain types of
projects run into cost overruns, and they incorporate those projections into their
presentation. First, the project will look expensive compared others. Second,
the observers might not give them credit for incorporating the overruns ahead
of time and might add an additional premium on top of their estimates, making the
project look even worse in comparison. The project manager suffers if they acknowledge the true costs ahead of time. From a societal perspective, it might be beneficial if a few less boondoggle high speed rail type projects get started under extremely rosy projections, but the people working on the project will hurt their careers if accurate information about the project's actual costs become widely known ahead of time.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that a person acted badly towards someone else</i></p>

<p>Knowing that another person treated someone badly is another
type of information that is sometimes protective but can also backfire. People
are already subject to fundamental attribution error where they ignore the
situational factors when judging otherâ€™s behavior. And if the person who did
something questionable is in their life regardless as part of their social
circle or exists in their business world, then it would be better not to hear
about a one-off instance of bad behavior unless it is likely that the bad
behavior is persistent or extreme enough to be worth noting.</p>

<p><i>Information about who is to blame during a crisis</i></p>

<p>Figuring out who to blame can backfire if everyone is going
to remain on the team and will be working to fix things together for the time
being. If there is a big leak in the boat, finding clues about who caused the
leak is a distraction to the main goal of bailing out the water and plugging
the hole. If two parents leave their child at the mall, understanding who was
supposed to bring them home does not help. Only after the crisis is solved is
information about who is at fault not likely to do more harm than good. Like
other types of potential information hazards, this only holds true to the
extent that the person at fault is not an active saboteur. (Or in the parent
analogy, itâ€™s possible that proof that one parent was at fault allows them to
stop fighting and focus on solving the problem)</p>

<p><i>General Solutions for personal information hazards:
Optimism, Social Grace and Esotericism</i></p>

<p>One confusing fact that the existence of personal information hazards help solve is how pessimists are generally more accurate than optimists, but
optimists succeed more often. About the only career in which pessimists do
better is law, where understanding downside scenarios is particularly valued. Developing
a bias towards optimism helps avoid focusing on information hazards that are more
likely to bring you or other people down.</p>

<p>One aspect of social grace is developing a habit of not
spewing out low-grade information hazards to people. If that is too difficult
for some people, and I can relate, then being a little bit more esoteric in
your speech and writings might be an alternative solution.</p>

<p>Knowledge in any amount can sometimes be a dangerous thing.
But thinking through some of these dynamics can …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>A perceptual color space is desirable when doing many kinds of image processing. It is useful for things like:</p><ul><li>Turning an image grayscale, while keeping the perceived lightness the same</li><li>Increasing the saturation of colors, while maintaining perceived hue and lightness</li><li>Creating smooth and uniform looking transitions between colors</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, while there are color spaces that aim to be perceptually uniform, none are without significant drawbacks when used for image processing.</p><p>For this reason I have designed a new perceptual color space, designed to be simple to use, while doing a good job at predicting perceived lightness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness">chroma</a> and hue. It is called the <strong>Oklab color space</strong>, because it is an OK Lab color space.</p><p>Before diving into the details of why a new color space is needed and how it was derived, here is the everything needed to use the color space:</p><p>A color in Oklab is represented with three coordinates, similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> works, but with better perceptual properties.

If you need a simple perceptual color space, try it out.</p><p>The rest of the post will go into why a new color space was needed, how it has been constructed and how it compares with existing color spaces.</p><hr><p>What properties does a perceptual color space need to satisfy to be useful for image processing? The answer to this is always going to be a bit subjective, but based on my experience, these are a good set of requirements:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Should be an opponent color space</strong>, similar to for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a>.</li><li><strong>Should predict lightness, chroma and hue well</strong>. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> should be perceived as orthogonal, so one can be altered without affecting the other two. This is useful for things like turning an image black and white and increasing colorfulness without introducing hue shifts etc.</li><li><strong>Blending two colors should result in even transitions</strong>. The transition colors should appear to be in between the blended colors (e.g. passing through a warmer color than either original color is not good).</li><li><strong>Should assume a D65 whitepoint</strong>. This is what common color spaces like sRGB, rec2020 and Display P3 uses.</li><li><strong>Should behave well numerically</strong>. The model should be easy to compute, numerically stable and differentiable.</li><li><strong>Should assume normal well lit viewing conditions</strong>. The complexity of supporting different viewing conditions is not practical in most applications. Other models could be used in conjunction if this is needed in some case.</li><li><strong>If the scale/exposure of colors are changed, the perceptual coordinates should just be scaled by a factor</strong>. More complex models that depend on absolute luminance should be avoided since the viewing conditions can not be accurately controlled and incorrect behavior would be confusing.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="what-about-existing-models%3F">What about existing models? <a href="#what-about-existing-models%3F"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>Let’s look at existing models and how they stack up against these requirements. Further down there are graphs that illustrate some of these issues.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV">CIELUV</a></strong> – Largest issue is their inability to predict hue. In particular blue hues are predicted badly. Other smaller issues exist as well</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM02-UCS</a> and the newer CAM16-UCS</strong> – Does a good job at being perceptually uniform overall, but doesn’t meet other requirements: Bad numerical behavior, it is not scale invariant and blending does not behave well because of its compression of chroma. Hue uniformity is decent, but other models predict it more accurately.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSA-UCS">OSA-UCS</a></strong> – Overall does a good job. The transformation to OSA-UCS lacks an analytical inverse unfortunately which makes it impractical.</li><li><strong><a href="https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/2858/">IPT</a></strong> – Does a great job modelling hue uniformity. Doesn’t predict lightness and chroma well unfortunately, but meets all other requirements. Is simple computationally and does not depend on the scale/exposure.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131&amp;id=368272">JzAzBz</a></strong> – Overall does a fairly good job. Designed to have uniform scaling of lightness for HDR data. While useful in some cases this introduces a dependence on the scale/exposure that makes it hard to use in general cases.</li><li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSV</a> representation of sRGB</strong> – Only on this list because it is widely used. Does not meet any of the requirements except having a D65 whitepoint.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So, all in all, all these existing models have drawbacks.</p><p>Out of all of these, two models stand out: CAM16-UCS, for being the model with best properties of perceptual uniformity overall, and IPT for having a simple computational structure that meets all the requirements besides predicting lightness and chroma well.</p><p>For this reason it is reasonable to try to make a new color space, with the same computational structure as IPT, but that performs closer to CAM16-UCS in terms of predicting lightness and chroma. This exploration resulted in Oklab.</p><h3 id="how-oklab-was-derived">How Oklab was derived <a href="#how-oklab-was-derived"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h3><p>To derive Oklab, three datasets were used:</p><ul><li>A generated data set of pairs of colors with the same lightness but random hue and chroma, generated using CAM16 and normal viewing conditions.

<p>As we look upon the sunset of a remarkably tiresome year, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about <strong>cryptographic wear-out</strong>.</p>



<h3>What is cryptographic wear-out?</h3>



<p>It’s the threshold when you’ve used the same key to encrypt so much data that you should probably switch to a new key before you encrypt any more. Otherwise, you might let someone capable of observing all your encrypted data perform interesting attacks that compromise the security of the data you’ve encrypted.</p>

<p>The exact value of the threshold varies depending on how exactly you’re encrypting data (n.b. AEAD modes, block ciphers + cipher modes, etc. each have different wear-out thresholds due to their composition).</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the wear-out limits of the more popular <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/">symmetric encryption methods</a>, and calculate those limits ourselves.</p>



<h2>Specific Ciphers and Modes</h2>

<h3 id="aes-gcm-limits">Cryptographic Limits for AES-GCM</h3>



<p>I’ve written about AES-GCM before (and <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">why I think it sucks</a>).</p>



<p>AES-GCM is a construction that combines AES-CTR with an authenticator called GMAC, whose consumption of nonces looks something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Calculating H (used in GHASH for all messages encrypted under the same key, regardless of nonce):<ul><li><code>Encrypt(00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000)</code></li></ul></li><li>Calculating J<sub>0</sub> (the pre-counter block):<ul><li>If the nonce is 96 bits long:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 00000001</code> where the <code>N</code> spaces represent the nonce hexits.</li></ul></li><li>Otherwise:<ul><li><code>s = 128 * ceil(len(nonce)/nonce) - len(nonce)</code></li></ul><ul><li><code>J0 = GHASH(H, nonce || zero(s+64) || int2bytes(len(nonce))</code></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Each block of data encrypted uses J0 + block counter (starting at 1) as a CTR nonce.</li><li>J0 is additionally used as the nonce to calculate the final GMAC tag.</li></ul>



<p>AES-GCM is one of the algorithms where it’s easy to separately calculate the safety limits per message (i.e. for a given nonce and key), as well as for all messages under a key.</p>



<h4>AES-GCM Single Message Length Limits</h4>



<p>In the simplest case (nonce is 96 bits), you end up with the following nonces consumed:</p>



<ul><li>For each key: <code>00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</code></li><li>For each (nonce, key) pair:<ul><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000001</code> for J0</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000002</code> for encrypting the first 16 bytes of plaintext</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN 000000003</code> for the next 16 bytes of plaintext…</li><li>…</li><li><code>NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN FFFFFFFFF</code> for the final 16 bytes of plaintext.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>From here, it’s pretty easy to see that you can encrypt the blocks from <code>00000002</code> to <code>FFFFFFFF</code> without overflowing and creating a nonce reuse. This means that each (key, nonce) can be used to encrypt a single message up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D+-+2&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32} - 2" title="2^{32} - 2"> blocks of the underlying ciphertext.</p>



<p>Since the block size of AES is 16 bytes, this means the maximum length of a single AES-GCM (key, nonce) pair is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+256&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{36} - 256" title="2^{36} - 256"> <strong>bytes</strong> (or 68,719,476,480 bytes). This is approximately 68 GB or 64 GiB.</p>



<p>Things get a bit tricker to analyze when the nonce is not 96 bits, since it’s hashed.</p>



<p>The disadvantage of this hashing behavior is that it’s possible for two different nonces to produce overlapping ranges of AES-CTR output, which makes the security analysis very difficult.</p>



<p>However, this hashed output is also hidden from network observers since they do not know the value of H. Without some method of reliably detecting when you have an overlapping range of hidden block counters, you can’t exploit this.</p>



<p>(If you want to live dangerously and motivate cryptanalysis research, mix 96-bit and non-96-bit nonces with the same key in a system that does something valuable.)</p>



<h4>Multi-Message AES-GCM Key Wear-Out</h4>



<p>Now that we’ve established the maximum length for a single message,  how many messages you can safely encrypt under a given AES-GCM key depends entirely on how your nonce is selected.</p>



<p>If you have a reliable counter, which is guaranteed to never repeat, and start it at 0 you can theoretically encrypt <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}"> messages safely. Hooray!</p>







<p>You probably don’t have a reliable counter, especially in real-world settings (distributed systems, multi-threaded applications, virtual machines that might be snapshotted and restored, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/2adic">2adic</a> for the expedient correction), you cannot safely encrypt more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks with AES because the keystream blocks–as the output of a block cipher–cannot repeat.</p>



<p>Most systems that cannot guarantee unique incrementing nonces simply generate nonces with a cryptographically secure random number generator. This is a good idea, but no matter how high quality your random number generator is, random functions will produce collisions with a discrete probability.</p>



<p>If you have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^n" title="2^n"> possible values, you should expect a single collision(with 50% probability) after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}"> (or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{n/2}" title="2^{n/2}">)samples. This is called the <strong>birthday bound</strong>.</p>



<p>However, 50% of a nonce reuse isn’t exactly a comfortable safety threshold for most systems (especially since nonce reuse will cause AES-GCM to become vulnerable to active attackers). 1 in 4 billion is a much more comfortable safety margin against nonce reuse via collisions than 1 in 2. Fortunately, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">calculate the discrete probability of a birthday collision</a> pretty easily.</p>



<p>If you want to rekey after your collision probability exceeds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{-32}" title="2^{-32}"> (for a random nonce between 0 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B96%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{96}" title="2^{96}">), you simply need to re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> messages.</p>

<h3 id="chacha20poly1305-limits">Cryptographic Limits for ChaCha20-Poly1305</h3>



<p>The IETF version of ChaCha20-Poly1305 uses 96-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters. A similar analysis follows from AES-GCM’s, with a few notable exceptions.</p>



<p>For starters, the one-time Poly1305 key is derived from the first 32 bytes of the ChaCha20 keystream output (block 0) for a given (nonce, key) pair. There is no equivalent to AES-GCM’s H parameter which is static for each key. (The ChaCha20 encryption begins using block 1.)</p>



<p>Additionally, each block for ChaCha20 is 512 bits, unlike AES’s 128 bits. So the message limit here is a little more forgiving.</p>



<p>Since the block size is 512 bits (or 64 bytes), and only one block is consumed for Poly1305 key derivation, we can calculate a message length limit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B38%7D+-+64&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{38} - 64" title="2^{38} - 64">, or 274,877,906,880 bytes–nearly 256 GiB for each (nonce, key) pair.</p>



<p>The same rules for handling 96-bit nonces applies as with AES-GCM, so we can carry that value forward.</p>

<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a variant of XSalsa20-Poly1305 (as used in libsodium) and the IETF’s ChaCha20-Poly1305 construction. It features 192-bit nonces and 32-bit internal counters.</p>



<p>XChaCha20-Poly1305 is instantiated by using HChaCha20 of the key over the first 128 bits of the nonce to produce a subkey, which is used with the remaining nonce bits using the aforementioned ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>This doesn’t change the maximum message length, but it <em>does</em> change the number of messages you can safely encrypt (since you’re actually using up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> distinct keys).</p>



<p>Thus, even if you manage to repeat the final ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce, as long as the total nonce differs, each encryptions will be performed with a distinct key (thanks to the HChaCha20 key derivation; see the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/xsalsa-20110204.pdf">XSalsa20 paper</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha-03">IETF RFC draft</a> for details).</p>

<h3>Cryptographic Limits for AES-CBC</h3>



<p>It’s tempting to compare non-AEAD constructions and block cipher modes such as CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), but they’re totally different monsters.</p>



<ul><li>AEAD ciphers have a clean delineation between message length limit and the message quantity limit</li><li>CBC and other cipher modes do not have this separation</li></ul>



<p>Every time you encrypt a block with AES-CBC, you are depleting from a <strong>universal</strong> bucket that affects the birthday bound security of encrypting more messages under that key. (And unlike AES-GCM with long nonces, AES-CBC’s IV is public.)</p>



<p>This is in addition to the operational requirements of AES-CBC (plaintext padding, initialization vectors that never repeat <em>and</em> must be unpredictable, separate message authentication since CBC doesn’t provide integrity and is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext atacks, etc.).</p>

<p>For this reason, most cryptographers don’t even bother calculating the safety limit for AES-CBC in the same breath as discussing AES-GCM. And they’re right to do so!</p>



<p>If you find yourself using AES-CBC (or AES-CTR, for that matter), you’d best be performing a separate HMAC-SHA256 over the ciphertext (and verifying this HMAC with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/#string-comparison">a secure comparison function</a> before decrypting). Additionally, you should consider using <a href="https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/blob/master/docs/CryptoDetails.md">an extended nonce construction to split one-time encryption and authentication keys</a>.</p>







<p>However, for the sake of completeness, let’s figure out what our practical limits are.</p>



<p>CBC operates on entire blocks of plaintext, whether you need the entire block or not.</p>



<p>On encryption, the output of the previous block is mixed (using XOR) with the current block, then encrypted with the block cipher. For the first block, the IV is used in the place of a “previous” block. (Hence, its requirements to be non-repeating <em>and</em> unpredictable.)</p>



<p>This means you can informally model (IV xor PlaintextBlock) and (PB<sub>n</sub> xor PB<sub>n+1</sub>) as a pseudo-random function, before it’s encrypted with the block cipher.</p>



<p>If those words don’t mean anything to you, here’s the kicker: You can use the above discussion about birthday bounds to calculate the upper safety bounds for the <strong>total</strong> number of blocks encrypted under a single AES key (assuming IVs are generated from a secure random source).</p>



<p>If you’re okay with a 50% probability of a collision, you should re-key after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> blocks have been encrypted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

				
				
	<p>I, as a person who tries to use cutting edge technology, am a Wayland
user, and ever since I started using it, I haven’t been able to get
the thoughts about its problems out of my head. It’s time to get this
thing off my chest. Here are the reasons Wayland is still not here:</p>
<h2 id="the-main-problem">The main problem</h2>
<p>You may think that it’s the fact that it was decided to move from the
“there’s only 1 display server” idea. You’re wrong, as that would
invalidate the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">core goals</a> of the project - to be just a protocol
that requires implementations.</p>
<p>What can’t be denied, however, is the fact that instead of creating a
full-featured “batteries included” set of protocols and a reference
implementation of a library, compositors based on which could compete
with X by being just as feature complete, there was created only a
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston" title="weston">simple compositor</a>, which can only satisfy the needs of a kiosk and
not a modern desktop environment. An unofficial version of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/" title="wlroots">such a
library</a> didn’t even appear until 2017.</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences-it-has">The consequences it has</h2>
<h3 id="feature-incompleteness">Feature incompleteness</h3>
<p>After 12 years of development, the implementations of the protocol
still have a series of features incompletely implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color management -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/pull/2353">2</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1360">3</a>,
<a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/issues/11">4</a></li>
<li>Variable refresh rate support -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/84">1</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1154">2</a>,
<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405912">3</a></li>
<li>High bit depth display support -
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/1378">1</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1391">2</a></li>
<li>DRM leasing -
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/49">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/1723">2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14">Screencasting</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.teamviewer.com/English/discussion/26340/state-of-wayland-teamviewer">Remote desktop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool">Input simulation and window control</a></li>
<li>Client-side global hotkey binding</li>
<li>Nvidia GPU support - yes it is indeed Nvidia’s fault, but to the
end user it makes no difference</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it’s not so many, and the partial fault here is on
clients rather than servers.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-difficulty">Implementation difficulty</h3>
<p>On the server side, while it’s true that Wayland makes implementing a
display server much easier, implementing a window manager is still a
nightmare. For example, even using a library, you need to write <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/tree/master/tinywl" title="tinywl">a
thousand lines of code</a> to implement the absolute bare bones
compositor, which won’t even support such critical things as damage
tracking, hi-DPI, graphical tablets, multiseat, and any input/output
configuration. X, on the other hand, allows you to write as few as <a href="http://incise.org/tinywm.html" title="tinywm">50
lines of code</a> because it handles most of things such as the ones
listed itself.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-standardization">Lack of standardization</h3>
<p>Wayland’s <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/">core set of protocols</a> while covering a wide range things,
doesn’t provide ones needed to build a modern desktop environment such
as a desktop shell protocol (to build such things as panels and
launchers), a protocol to simulate input and control windows, a
protocol to control the clipboard, and others, leaving that to the
compositors. While <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/" title="wlr-protocols">such a set of protocols</a> does exist, it’s not
adopted by the majority of the compositors. A similar problem is
happening to <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal" title="xdg-desktop-portal">the set of protocols</a> required to screenshot, screencast
and remote desktop - the adoption by clients is extremely low. This
makes working with Wayland and debugging it much less flexible and
compositor-dependable than X, and makes developing clients even
harder.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-configurability">Lack of configurability</h3>
<p>In contrast to X.org, which has <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/xorg.conf">a unified config system</a>, each
Wayland compositor has to implement configuration separately. This
results in not only inconvenience when trying to move the config from
one compositor to another or describing how to configure something,
but also different feature coverage by different compositors. For
example, a compositor may not implement an input configuration such as
scrolling speed or graphical tablet mapping or an output configuration
such as display bit depth. <a href="https://github.com/Hjdskes/cage/issues/138">In some cases</a> the compositor may not even
implement any input configuration, which makes using it extremely
problematic, especially considering such a problem doesn’t exist when
using X.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Considering the listed problems, the Wayland’s future doesn’t look
that bright. But don’t give up hope just yet, as long as we have
projects like wlroots pushing the innovation, not everything is lost!</p>

  <p><span>07 Jun 2020</span></p><p><img src="https://pratikone.github.io/public/images/speech_bubble1.png" alt="bubble" title="Image source : https://pixabay.com/illustrations/speech-bubble-thinking-talk-5775045/" height="auto" width="30%"></p>

<p>Java has a runtime. We have seen countless times to install or update JRE - Java Runtime environment. Python too has runtime. It is provided by the python executable. But what about C ? Does it have a runtime ? I have never come across a C runtime installer. How about C++ ?<br>
The short answer is <strong>YES</strong>. <br>
C has a runtime, albeit a tiny one and C++ also has a runtime. We don’t notice it because it is usually provided by the OS itself and with every new OS update, it gets updated. There is a small exception with that (VC runtime library on Windows) but we will talk about it later. Let’s get to the basics.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-c-runtime-crt-">What is C runtime (CRT) ?</h2>
<p>Whenever we refer to C runtime, we usually mean one or both of these things:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Bootstrap and Runtime environment</em>  : It sets up the necessary bootstrapping code which tells the OS how to run this binary code, followed by code for setting up the runtime environment for executing user code. It is included as inline assembly in the compiled binary itself.</li>
  <li><em>Runtime library</em> : it contains functions to interact with the OS; functions to allocate memory, read and write to files, network etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bootstrap-and-c-runtime-environment">Bootstrap and C runtime environment</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this is the code which sets up the execution point for the program for the OS to call. It defines the structure of functions, setup call stack and its calling convention (_stdcall, __cdecl ). This is the most important and necessary code to run our program in the OS.  It is specific to the OS version and doesn’t usually change but gets updated by the OS itself during its update. Among those dozens of Windows update we receive regularly, some of them update the CRT too.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b2d86d471d92.png" alt="winupdate" title="Please wait while Windows is updating ..." height="auto" width="50%"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a> is a special file which gets linked to every program during the linking phase of compilation. It has basic program loading routines which instruct the compiler on how to call this program’s <code>main()</code> function and even exit the running program. Like everything else in the C and C++ ecosystem, there is a flexibility of choice on including it. If one wants to write his/her own startup code, they can avoid linking to crt0 altogether (<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html">nostartfiles</a> in GCC) and just provide their code in <code>_start</code> label in assembly (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29694564/what-is-the-use-of-start-in-c"><code>_start</code> calls <code>main()</code> of user code</a>). 
In case of C++, <code>crt1</code> can be linked alternatively,  which provides some extra functionality for constructor and destructors.</p>

<h3 id="c-runtime-library">C runtime library</h3>
<p>The runtime library or standard library (<code>stdlib</code>) contains a series of useful functions like <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>memcpy</code> (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference?view=msvc-160">MSVC</a>, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">GCC</a> ) for interacting with the OS which almost every program needs. This part can be statically or dynamically linked. Windows provides libcmt.lib for C and libcpmt.lib for C++. 
If one chooses to link it statically, only the code called by the user’s program gets added to its binary, increasing the size. Removing stdlib can significantly reduce the binary size, which could be as significant as 90% in tiny programs. If one has to create the C code binary with smallest size, this would be the key step in reducing binary size to ~ 1 kb.</p>

<p>If one dynamically links to CRT, this size bump is not there (it is standard for programs to dynamically link to this library for multiple reasons like compatibility with other dll, apart from small size saving). Every OS provides an implementation. <code>UCRT.dll</code> on Windows and <code>libc.so</code> (GLibc) on Linux.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Normal dynamic loading of dll rule applies : If the program loads two different versions of CRT dll, they won’t share global variables. Not taking care of this fact could cause very subtle bugs in multi-dll codebases,  in calling runtime functions which maintain any state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A user code cannot be faster than its runtime library’s performance.
Runtime libraries keep getting improvements through updates and one can receive those fixes as part of VC++Runtime updates on Windows or libc updates on Linux. Programs compiled with a specific CRT lib may expect that specific or compatible CRT dll. Thus, it is possible to keep side by side copies of different versions of CRT dlls (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL hell ?</a>).</p>

<h2 id="all-you-need-is-c">All you need is C</h2>
<p>C runtime is an interesting piece of software - it depends not only on OS and architecture but also on compiler. To give an example, runtime code generated on 64 bit windows by GCC would be different from that generated by MSVC. 
If you want to port C to a brand new OS,  all you need apart from the compiler is a working C runtime and that’s it, C gets ported.</p>

Instead, each node on the Ethereum mainnet has its own pool of transactions and, combined, they all form the global pool.</p><p>The thousands of pending transactions that enter the global pool by being broadcast on the network and before being included in a block are an always changing data set that’s holding millions of dollars at any given second.</p><p>There’s a lot that one can do hereâ€”and many do and make this txpool business a highly competitive market.</p><p>A few examples, listed in the order of inconspicuous to contentious:</p><ul><li>Yield farming â€” you can watch the transactions movement between DeFi applications to be one of the first to detect the yield farming profitability changes.</li><li>Liquidity providing â€” you detect the potential liquidity movements in and out of DeFi applications and act on the changes.</li><li>Arbitrage â€” you can detect the movement of transactions that will affect token prices at different DEXes and make your arbitrage trades based on that.</li><li>Front running â€” you can automatically grab the existing pending transactions, simulate them to identify the potential profit if the transaction is executed, copy the transaction and swap the existing address with your own, and submit it with a higher miner fee so that your transaction gets executed on-chain before the one you are copying.</li><li>Doing a MEV â€” MEV stands for Miner Extractable Value, and it’s based on that miners are theoretically free to include any transactions in the blocks and/or reorder them. This is a variation of the front running where instead of submitting your transaction with a higher fee to the same pool you picked it from, you get it directly into a block through a miner and bypass the pool.</li></ul><p>To run any of the described scenarios, you need access to the Ethereum txpool, and you need the methods to retrieve the transactions from the txpool. While Chainstack has you covered with fast dedicated nodes for the former, this article focuses on all the ways you can look into the txpool.</p><h2>Retrieving pending transactions with Geth</h2><p>Since pending transactions are your targets in the txpool space, we are now going to make this a structured effort and focus on answering the following questions while accompanying the answers with practical examples:</p><ul><li>How do I retrieve pending transactions?</li><li>Why do I view global or local pending transactions?</li><li>Can I view global pending transactions without txpool namespace?</li></ul><p>There are a few ways to retrieve pending transactions.</p><ul><li>Filters</li><li>Subscriptions</li><li>Txpool API</li><li>GraphQL API</li></ul><p>Before we start, lets clarify a few things:</p><ul><li><strong>Global pending transactions</strong> refer to pending transactions that are happening globally, which includes your newly created local pending transactions.<br><strong>Local pending transactions</strong> refer strictly to the transactions that you created on your local node. Note that you need â€˜personalâ€™ namespace enabled for Geth to send local transactions.</li><li><strong>Pending transactions</strong> refer to transactions that are pending due to various reasons, like extremely low gas, out of order nonce, etc.</li><li>Chainstack is using <strong>Geth (Go Ethereum)</strong> client.</li></ul><h3>Filters</h3><p>When we create a filter on Geth, Geth will return a unique <code>filter_id</code>. Do note that this <code>filter_id</code> will only live for 5 minutes from the last query on that specific filter. If you query this filter after 5 minutes, the filter will not exist anymore.</p><h4>Creating a pending transaction filter and retrieving data from it</h4><h5>cURL</h5><p><strong>Create filter</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>'{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_newPendingTransactionFilter","params":[],"id":73}'</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{ "id":73, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "0xb337f6e2f833ecffc6e9315ba06cd03d" }</code></pre><h5>Web3.js</h5><p>Filter for pending transactions is not supported anymore. Please use <a href="#subscriptions">Subscriptions</a>.</p><h5>Web3.py</h5><p><strong>Create filter</strong></p><pre><code>pending_transaction_filter= web3.eth.filter('pending')</code></pre><p><strong>Access filter</strong></p><pre><code>print(pending_transaction_filter.get_new_entries())</code></pre><h3>Common sources of confusion on filters</h3><h4>Web3.py and the pending argument</h4><p>Why does web3.py have their input arguments as <em>pending</em> instead of a dictionary which contains the usual filter parameters like <code>fromBlock</code>, <code>toBlock</code>, <code>address</code>, <code>topics</code>.</p><p>This is because Web3 does the mapping internally. If we look at the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/blob/72457e6f9f3cb6d51fe492d1a65bed7904639760/web3/eth.py#L474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">web3.py source code</a>, when web3.py receives a string pending, it will be mapped to <code>eth_newPendingTransactionFilter</code>, and when web3.py receives a dictionary, it is mapped to <code>eth_newFilter</code>.</p><p>To add to this, web3.py has <code>get_new_entries</code> as well as <code>get_all_entries</code> for filters but <code>get_all_entries</code> does not work in our case. This is because <code>eth_newPendingTransactionFilter</code> does not have <code>get_all_entries</code> available for it.</p><h4>From latest block to pending block filter</h4><p>Why doesn’t the following filter give me real-time pending transactions?</p><pre><code>web3.eth.filter({'fromBlock': 'latest', 'toBlock': 'pending'})</code></pre><p>A filter only returns <code>new_entries()</code> when the state has changed. This specific filter state changes only when there is a new latest block or pending block. Thus, you will only receive changes when there is a new latest block or pending block, i.e. <code>(eth.getBlock('latest') / pending)</code>.</p><h4>The getPendingTransactions filter</h4><p>Why is the following giving me a different or empty result?</p><pre><code>web3.eth.getPendingTransactions().then(console.log)</code></pre><p>This function is mapped to <code>eth.pendingTransactions</code> which is a function to check local pending transactions and does not give you global transactions.</p><p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/ead814616c094331915b03edd82d4200a7880178/internal/ethapi/api.go#L1700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geth source code</a>, only <code>pendingTransactions</code> that has its <code>from</code> field matching with your personal account will be shown.</p><h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3><p>Subscriptions is real-time streaming of data from server to client through WebSocket. You will need a constantly active connection to stream such events. You cannot use curl for this and have to use a WebSocket client like <a href="https://github.com/vi/websocat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">websocat</a> if you want to access it via command line. Once executed, a stream of pending transaction IDs will start flowing in.</p><p>For other supported subscriptions, check the Geth documentation: <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/pubsub#supported-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Supported Subscriptions</a>.</p><h4>Creating a subscription</h4><h5>Websocat</h5><p><strong>Connect to node</strong></p><pre><code>websocat wss://username:<a href="https://chainstack.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2e5e4f5d5d59415c4a6e595d03404a031f1c1d031a1b1803191617005e1c5e474857004d4143">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre><p><strong>Create subscription</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>{"id": 1, "method": "eth_subscribe", "params": ["newPendingTransactions"]}</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2d4f3eb938cdb0b6fa9052de7c4da5de"}</code></pre><p><strong>Incoming stream</strong></p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_subscription","params":{"subscription":"0x2d4f3eb938cdb0b6fa9052de7c4da5de","result":"0xee426dbaef2a432d0433d5de600347e97b6a8a855daf8765c18cf1b7efc53461"}}
...</code></pre><h3>Txpool API</h3><p>Txpool is a Geth-specific API namespace that keeps pending and queued transactions in the local memory pool. Geth’s default is 4096 pending and 1024 queued transactions. However, <a href="https://etherscan.io/txsPending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Etherescan reports</a> a much bigger number of pending transactions. If we view Geth’s txpool, we will not be able to get all of the transactions. Once the pool of 4096 is full, Geth replaces older pending values with newer pending transactions.</p><p>If you need a bigger pool to be stored on your node, the flag <code>--txpool.globalslots</code> can be adjusted to a higher value on <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geth CLI options</a>. Do note that the larger the number, the bigger the payload size.</p><p>If you see your <code>txpool_status</code> to be empty, it can mean your node has not fully synced.</p><p>The txpool namespace is only supported on Chainstack dedicated nodes.</p><h4>Creating a txpool filter</h4><h5>cURL</h5><p><strong>Create filter</strong></p><p>Request body:</p><pre><code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_newPendingTransactionFilter","params":[],"id":73}</code></pre><p>Response body:</p><pre><code>{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 73, "result": { "pending": {...}, "queued": {...} } }</code></pre><h5>Web3.js</h5><p><a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0-alpha/web3-eth-txpool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TxPool Module</a>.</p><h5>Web3.py</h5><p><a href="https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.geth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geth API</a>.</p><h3>GraphQL API</h3><p>The biggest advantage of <a href="https://chainstack.com/graphql-on-ethereum-availability-on-chainstack-and-a-quick-rundown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using GraphQL</a> is that you can filter out the specific fields of the transaction that you want. The query in GraphQL goes through the elements within the txpool. Thus, its limitations are the same as the ones of txpool as stated above.</p><p>The following is an example which shows the information of a pending transaction.</p><p>Query example:</p><pre><code>query {
  pending {
    transactions {
      hash
      gas
      value
      gasPrice
      nonce
      r
      s
      v
      inputData
      status
      gasUsed
      cumulativeGasUsed
      from {
        address
      }
      to {
        address
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre><p>GraphQL API is currently supported on Chainstack <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dedicated Ethereum nodes</a>.</p><p>I hope this blog serves you well in understanding the various ways of retrieving pending transactions.</p><h2>Additional resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/web3-eth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Web3.eth</a></li><li><a href="https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ethereum JSON-RPC API</a></li><li><a href="https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000820506-Checking-pending-and-queued-transactions-in-your-Ethereum-node-s-local-pool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Checking pending and queued transactions in your Ethereum node’s local pool</a></li><li><a href="https://support.chainstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/900003426246-Subscribing-to-global-new-pending-transactions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribing to global new pending transactions</a></li></ul><h2>Join our community of innovators</h2><ul><li>To learn more about Chainstack, visit our <a href="https://docs.chainstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knowledge Center</a> or join our <a href="https://gitter.im/chainstack/Lobby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitter Lobby</a>.</li><li>Sign up for a <a href="https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Developer account</a>, or explore the options offered by <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth or Business plans</a>.</li><li>Take a look at our pricing tiers using a <a href="https://chainstack.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handy calculator</a> to estimate usage and number of nodes.</li></ul><p>Have you already explored what you can achieve with Chainstack? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create" target="_blank">Get started for free today</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

  <!-- INSERT LATCH HTML -->
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/">blog</a> | <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">oilshell.org</a></p>

<p>
  2020-12-23
</p>
<p>I usually don't post videos here, but the first one in this series <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">got a
positive reaction on Reddit</a>, and there are two more.</p>
<p>I've been interested in implementing simple and efficient <strong>regex matching</strong>
with the derivatives technique for a couple years. But I haven't had time to
play with code that implements it, or read the original papers more carefully.</p>
<p>These videos helped me understand the technique despite the fact I haven't
done math in over a decade.  Others apparently felt the same way.  The
explanation is simple but not dumbed down.</p>
 
<a name="context"></a>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>For context, see the two July 2020 posts  tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a>,
particularly <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/07/ideas-questions.html#regular-expression-derivatives-papers-and-code">this part of the second post, on derivatives</a>.</p>
<p>Summary: A 2009 paper revived this regex matching technique.  There have been
many implementations since, though no popular ones.</p>
<a name="how-does-this-relate-to-shell"></a>
<h3>How Does This Relate to Shell?</h3>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in those posts, a <strong>glob</strong> like <code>[a-c]*.py</code> is essentially a
limited form of regex.
<ul>
<li>I noted in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491467">this Hacker News comment</a> that the obscure
"extended glob" feature of bash gives globs the power of regular
expressions, by adding repetition and alternation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be nice if <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">egg expressions</a> could be <strong>compiled</strong> to a
full DFA in C, as we do in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=lexing#lexing">Oil's lexer</a> via <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=re2c#re2c">re2c</a>.
<ul>
<li>This seems doable, and the author of an <a href="https://github.com/jack-pappas/facio/tree/master/Reggie">F# compiler
toolkit</a> relays
valuable experience at the bottom of the thread.  I'd like to do the same
thing without the .NET runtime, depending only on code in Oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be nice if <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">egg expressions</a> weren't limited to the
features of the pattern matching engine in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=libc#libc">libc</a>.  Non-greedy
capturing like <code>foo.*?bar</code> would be nice, although capturing and matching are
two different problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EasyTheory Videos</h2>
<a name="derivative-of-a-regex-brzozowski-derivative"></a>
<h3>Derivative of a Regex?! (Brzozowski Derivative)</h3>
<p>This video explains what a derivative is using the recursive definition of
regular expressions.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This one walks through an example of a regex and its derivative.</p>

<h3>Regex to DFA Directly Using Brzozowski Derivatives (No NFA)</h3>
<p>This one shows how to directly convert a regular expression to a DFA with
derivatives.  This is interesting because DFAs can be executed efficiently.
See the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">Reddit thread</a> for more color on this.</p>

<a name="why-call-this-operation-a-derivative"></a>
<h2>Why Call This Operation a Derivative?</h2>
<p>I don't know, and the videos don't explain it!  I assume there is some
connection between algebra and calculus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/khec43/video_derivative_of_a_regex_brzozowski_derivative/">Reddit thread</a> has some speculation on this.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/kj6svq/three_great_videos_about_regex_derivatives/?">Leave a
comment</a> if you have ideas.</p>
<p>I recently explained that <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/k5yj4c/modern_parser_generator/geiew2e/">languages are sets, not algorithms</a>.
And MathOverflow says that <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1574197">derivatives can be expressed in set
theory</a>.  But I don't know if that's
a useful way to think about it.</p>
<a name="more-info"></a>
<h2>More Info</h2>
<ul>
<li>These videos are part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyTheory/videos">EasyTheory
channel</a>, which started 9 months
ago, and has many videos that go deeply into the theory of computation.
<ul>
<li>Caveat: this is pure theory, and I'm mainly interested in <strong>engineering
consequences</strong>, like compiling with fewer lines of code and executing
efficiently.  Posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=computer-science#computer-science">computer-science</a> explain other
such connections.</li>

December 23, 2020 | https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>

<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="6a02031803040d2a03070d1044090507">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/bye-social-media/cover.jpg"></p>

<p><span>N</span>ot long ago, we lived in small hunter-gatherer tribes. Social skills evolved along our abilities to use physical tools and language. We spent our days hunting or foraging our food, and had plenty of free time to ponder life. Our survival was dependent upon our social skills. We were rewarded (by the fruits of cooperation) for having friends and social support, and killed (mostly by hunger or predators) if we were antisocial. Our brains developed to be very sensitive to social interactions. The ability to read other’s emotions, give them importance, and respond to them is a part of our hard-wired social brain. It also takes a lot of mental energy.</p>

<p>In the early days of social media, I was (as is usual with me) an avid promoter and ethusiast. Social media is just <em>amazing</em> for so many things: exploring ideas, being up to date with many topics, connecting with tons of people. Social media helped me bootstrap my professional life, and meet some of the most amazing people. However, I’ve now come to believe that in a couple of years, most people will view using social media as unhealthy, like we do today with smoking. We might need to find better ways to get these benefits withtout the costs.</p>

<p>I stopped using Facebook ~3 years ago, and Instagram ~2 years ago. My online life has been much better since. My offline life too. Today (actually,&nbsp;a month ago), I left Twitter. The costs are simply too high for me. I noticed the less I use any of those apps, the calmer my mind, the more I read, and the more time I spend outside, in real contact with other people and nature. These are things I value more than instant access to news and daily contact with thousands of people at this time.</p>

<p>It is very hard to argue that social media is not harmful for most. We are simply not made to continually know what everyone else is doing or thinking, all the time! And it’s not a neutral tech. It is actively addictive and destructive to our volition. Most of the people I’ve talked to say they’d like to use these apps less. Yet somehow they don’t. Our brains are wired to pay attention to each other and to care about what others think about us. Social media is designed to exploit both these things. It is engineered to hook us in, and to influence our behavior. That’s the product Facebook, Instagram and Twitter sell to their customers: changing your ideas and behavior. And they got some pretty talented people working on that.</p>

<p>I don’t really think I can convince anyone to leave social media. I don’t even think it’s bad for everyone or that the benefits can’t outweigh the costs for some. I’m writing this post because many of you will already be close to leaving one of these apps. You’ve been thinking about it already. You’ve already made up your mind about it, and you’re waiting for the right moment. If just one person makes the final step into at least <em>trying</em> to live without social media, I’ll be happy.&nbsp;It has made a huge change for me. If you think this is stupid or I don’t understand the beauty of the Internet, I think you’ll change your mind in a few years. Or social media will ;)</p>

<p>If you do leave social media, feel free to contact me after a couple of months to share experiences. It’s been amazing for me, and I’m not going back. I’m really interested in knowing more about how this change can affect other people’s life. I’m also curious to find new ways to stay in touch with people outside my local community which are less toxic to my mind.</p>

<p>To close this brief post, I’ll share a bold prediction (and hope) on this topic: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will have less monthly active users in 2025 than today (~2.6 billion, ~1 billion, ~330 million, respectively). I added this to my <a href="https://maraoz.com/2016/03/20/2026/">predictions for 2026 post</a>.</p>

<p>There are many great tools for logs and metrics in the K8s ecosystem, but when there’s a problem, skilled SREs and developers still spend a lot of time searching through logs and dashboards to find root cause. The underlying challenge is the near infinite number of possible failure modes in distributed applications.</p>



<p>Now, imagine a machine learning system that could uncover root cause just by watching a feed of logs and metrics? And imagine if it didn’t require any training or setup? In this webinar, we will discuss a number of machine learning techniques for logs and metrics and then demonstrate what this looks like in real life. Spoiler alert: ML really can detect problems and their root cause unaided!</p>

programming environments—<wbr>henceforth <span>IDE</span>s, for “integrated development
environments”—<wbr>for decades. This article records my current thinking (as of
2020), and will probably grow over time.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.At_the_.Beginning)"></a>At the Beginning</h3><p>We began the <a href="https://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a> project (then called DrScheme) in 1995 on the
premise that we wanted to build a <span>pedagogic</span> <span>IDE</span>. Our initial goals
were set by our context: students learning to program in Scheme inside
Emacs. Each such institution had its own set of idiosyncratic Emacs
key-bindings that students were forced to memorize, while also being plunged
into the complexity of an editor vastly more sophisticated than anything they
had used before, where any odd key combination could drop them into a confusing
state from which recovery often needed expert help.<span><span><span>No, this is not an
Emacs rant. For the record, I still use Emacs. In fact, this article was
written using Emacs.</span></span></span> It was hardly student-friendly for all but the most
adventurous (who, of course, loved it).</p><p>At the same time, this is when the US’s AP Computer Science curriculum was
shoving C++ down the throats of schools. As a result, many students were
entering college having seen a sophisticated graphical <span>IDE</span> like Visual
C++. On the one hand, these set an expectation amongst students that an <span>IDE</span>
would be a rich graphical environment that looked like a native application;
its absence made education feel inauthentic. On the other hand, the number of
buttons and options in such <span>IDE</span>s were problematic. Many students felt
overwhelmed; a few (probably the same ones who loved discovering the recesses of
Emacs) clicked away at random, losing sight of fundamental learning.</p><p>Thus, at the very outset, we had three goals:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Make a reasonable, modern, native-looking application.</p></li><li><p>Make a stand-alone application where we can control the experience,
rather than an island surrounded by a sea of dragons.</p></li><li><p>Minimize distraction, confusion, and unnecessary (especially undesirable)
choice.</p></li></ul></div><p>We have since grown comfortable with applications being delivered through the
Web, so Web-based <span>IDE</span>s are now a reasonable alternative to that native
application, and indeed confer many benefits that the native application does
not. However, these conceptual rules remain important.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.More_.Insights)"></a>More Insights</h3><p>As we continued to build DrRacket, a few more rules became clear. We have
documented them and their justification extensively elsewhere (such as
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkf-drscheme-journal/">this paper</a> and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-programmable-prog-lang/">this one</a>),
so I’ll just summarize them here:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Languages evolve by accruing complexity, which can create dangerous reefs
on which students can founder. We need principled, teaching-friendly
sub-languages that eliminate accidental complexity.<span><span><span>Even if a language is
designed from scratch to avoid this problem, it can still contain different
levels of complexity.</span></span></span></p></li><li><p>Just as a textbook does not plunge students into a whole language at once
but rather builds it up incrementally, <span>IDE</span>s should introduce the language
incrementally, matching a book’s needs and supporting a learning progression.</p></li><li><p>Errors matter! Error messages should be carefully written to be friendly
and helpful to students, whose needs may be different from those of a
developer.</p></li><li><p>Sub-languages must be epistemically closed, with errors inside this
closure. Concretely, error messages should never use vocabulary or concepts
beyond what has been introduced up to that point in the curriculum.</p></li></ul></div><p>These principles drove the development of DrRacket. Furthermore,
<a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> created
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ffkf-mred/">linguistic</a>
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-programmable-prog-lang/">abstractions</a>
that embodied these ideas. This enabled several textbooks to map their own
learning progressions to corresponding sub-languages in DrRacket, giving their
student users the same benefits that users of <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span> enjoyed.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.More_.About_.Feedback)"></a>More About Feedback</h3><p>We weren’t done with error messages (and <span>IDE</span> feedback more
generally). Starting in 2010, <a href="https://gmarceau.qc.ca/">Guillaume Marceau</a>,
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~kfisler/">Kathi Fisler</a>, and I began to investigate the error messages of
DrRacket using the methods of <span>HCI</span>. What
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice-sigcse/">we found</a>
was deeply disturbing: that the errors often were not helping students fix
their problems.</p><p>Indeed,
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-mind-lang-novice-inter-error-msg/">we also found</a>
that even the vocabulary used in messages was difficult for
students. For instance, we had carefully distinguished between concepts like
“operator”, “constructor”, and “predicate”. But for students who had not
yet picked up those distinctions, these all looked like gobbledygook; the only
term they were familiar with was “function”. This necessitated
<span>removing</span> these careful distinctions to make the messages more
decipherable and hence actionable. We also noticed that instructors often used
vocabulary different from that of the <span>IDE</span>; libraries also created their own
ontology or used their own style that contradicted the <span>IDE</span>. In short,
</p><div><ul><li><p><span>IDE</span> feedback lives in an ecosystem consisting of the programming
language, books, third-party libraries, educators, and more. All of these need
to be in harmony, and require style guides to facilitate agreement.</p></li></ul></div><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Ground_.Truth)"></a>Ground Truth</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve come to realize there is another critical aspect
to pedagogic <span>IDE</span>s that truly distinguishes them from a conventional <span>IDE</span>
designed for a developer. It’s that a pedagogic <span>IDE</span> has <span>ground truth</span>.
I’ve been pursuing this under various guises for some years now, but only in the past
two years have these pursuits coalesced into a clear thesis.</p><p>Here’s what I mean by ground truth. In almost every pedagogic setting, we are
asking students to create <span>something we have already done</span>.</p><p>In a conventional programming setting, such as in industry, programmers do not
re-build perfect replicas of existing systems. If they’re re-implementing a
system, often it’s with an eye to at least improving it, and usually to
ultimately changing it. In the very rare cases that they want to identically
reproduce a system, it’s usually for intellectual property reasons, and thus
done with various safeguards against communication. In general, though, the
thing they are trying to build doesn’t already exist (which is why they’re
building it—<wbr>if it already existed in good form, they would be put to work on
something else).</p><p>This is the opposite of what we do in education. In education, it is utterly
standard for a hundred students to all be striving, independently, to perfectly
reproduce something we have already done.<span><span><span>Indeed, great effort goes into
making sure these students don’t merely pawn off as their own what other
students have done.</span></span></span> Indeed, there are solid educational reasons for this. The
fact that we have done all this already, and can often point to our work as
exemplary, gives us a <span>ground truth</span> that conventional programming
lacks. My thesis is that:</p><p><span>This ground truth can and should be <br>
exploited to improve student learning.</span></p><h3>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.How_.Can_.We_.Use_.Ground_.Truth_)"></a>How Can We Use Ground Truth?</h3><p>In a way, numerous educators, for decades, have been using ground truth: by
giving students a test suite against which to run their programs. I find this
practice odious for several reasons:<span><span><span>If you are going to do it anyway, at
least avoid the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wkf-who-tests-testers/">perils we’ve identified</a>.</span></span></span>
It promotes “passing the instructor’s
suite” as the most important trait a program should satisfy (whereas, often,
it is one of the least important). It fails to teach students to think about
correctness for themselves, treating it as an outsourced activity. It often
encourages a mentality of “keep tweaking and submitting until you pass”,
which as a programming practice is both utterly unauthentic and arguably
dangerous. (Adding rate limits is a symptom of a problem with the pedagogy, not
a solution.) More subtly, and perhaps worse, it robs students of important
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/wk-examplar/">stimuli for problem understanding</a>.
But most of all, this is primarily a means of <span>assessment</span>, not of
<span>instruction</span>.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can recognize in this widely-used practice the germ of this
idea, but we should turn it into a student aid, and we need to generalize
it. Why has it not already been widely generalized? I would argue for two
reasons, one pedagogic and one technical:
</p><div><ul><li><p>We don’t ask students to produce a broad enough range of artifacts.</p></li><li><p>Comparing artifacts is hard from a technical perspective. Relatedly,
giving actionable feedback is hard both technically and from a human factors
perspective.</p></li></ul></div><h3>6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Multiple_.Artifacts)"></a>Multiple Artifacts</h3><p><span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span> is perhaps the canonical example of a programming pedagogy
that asks students to produce (a) multiple artifacts, that are (b)
interrelated, and are in a (c) progression that matches progress through
problem-solving. Concretely, students are asked to produce
</p><div><ul><li><p>data definitions</p></li><li><p>a purpose statement</p></li><li><p>a function signature</p></li><li><p>examples of function use</p></li><li><p>a function template</p></li><li><p>the function body</p></li><li><p>tests of the function</p></li></ul></div><p>The nice thing about having multiple artifacts from different stages of
development is that:
</p><div><ul><li><p>We can give feedback early.</p></li><li><p>We can correct problems when it doesn’t cost much to fix them. (Once a
student has fully implemented their system, giving feedback on failing tests
will invariably only produce minor tweaks in the program, never large-scale
architectural changes.)</p></li><li><p>We can give different kinds of feedback, some of which will be better
appreciated by some students and others better by others.</p></li><li><p>We can make the desolate progression from a blank page to a fully-working
program a more rich, textured interaction between student and (otherwise
foreboding and hostile) tool.</p></li></ul></div><p>Imagine that for each of the artifacts above, we have our own ground truth

kinds</span> of artifacts. Running their program against our tests is conventional
practice, but we have many more choices:

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our teams are working to coordinate the many individuals and organizations that have offered to help advance The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. (Rocky Linux). The core team is working to lay the infrastructure that will support the legal entity and the engineering efforts required to deliver and support an initial release. Updates regarding project news, release dates, and more will be announced on our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, <a href="https://rockylinux.org/">website</a>, and <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/all-rocky-linux-links/833">other social media platforms</a>.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Transparency with the community and for those that will be relying on Rocky Linux to supplant their CentOS 8 installations before support expiration is paramount. We will soon be communicating a timeline for the delivery of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures</li>
<li>When the testing package repository will be made public</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing</li>
<li>Release candidate availability</li>
</ul>
<p>We are targeting Q2 2021 to deliver our first release of Rocky Linux, made available not only in standard commercial regions, but also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us">GovCloud</a>, and China.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past three weeks, here is some of the progress we’ve made:</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have selected and vetted auditing, logging, and user account management tooling.</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS):
<ul>
<li>The team selected AWS as the primary build platform for development of Rocky Linux. AWS was chosen primarily to protect the integrity of the software supply chain for Rocky Linux.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, donated hardware and rack space isn’t sufficient to meet our supply chain integrity needs.</li>
<li>Traditional physical hardware separate from our production build environment will still be necessary, and we expect a large portion of our infrastructure will exist outside of AWS for the purposes of business continuity, cost, and platform agnosticity.</li>
<li>We have outlined an infrastructure to best secure and facilitate our engineering efforts using multiple VPCs, subnets, and regions for high availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data Centers:
<ul>
<li>We are negotiating with several data center providers for the secure hosting of our physical infrastructure.</li>
<li>After we have our physical infrastructure provider solidified, we will reach back out to those that have offered to donate hardware .</li>
<li>Discussions with the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (<a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSUOSL</a>) regarding resources are in the works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The core tenets of the Infrastructure Team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a platform for the automatic and secure builds of packages and components which will allow for community participation without sacrificing security or trust in the resulting packages</li>
<li>The integrity of the build pipeline and software supply chain are paramount.</li>
<li>Be as vendor and platform agnostic as possible. Avoid vendor lock-in.</li>
<li>Be transparent with the community, to the extent possible and practical.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<ul>
<li>The build process for Rocky Linux will use <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji">Koji</a> and <a href="https://pagure.io/fm-orchestrator/tree/master">MBS</a>.</li>
<li>We are developing scripts and build tools to create a pipeline that allows pulling sources, debranding, and building through Koji and <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki">Mock</a>.</li>
<li>The progress of proof of concepts and processes utilized by the Rocky Linux build process, including all errors and dependencies, is being documented in the <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/Development">wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Security team has drafted a Data Classification Policy, which will be made available for public comment pending review.</li>
<li>Groups, members, and permissions structures for the build infrastructure have been laid out for review and evaluation.</li>
<li>In parallel with the infrastructure team, we have architected and designed AWS network and security topologies aligned with best practices and security standards.</li>
<li>Work has started on OpenSCAP documents for popular STIGs.</li>
<li>Plans are being made with the goal of Rocky Linux becoming FIPS compliant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web</h2>
<ul>
<li>In only 12 days, our <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a> have received nearly 150K page views.</li>
<li>Bandwidth to GitHub resources has exceeded the current plan, requiring an upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have chosen <a href="https://rbcreative.team/">Red Barn Creative Team</a> (<em>formerly Hackerthreads</em> ) as the designated / authorized vendor to sell Rocky Linux branded merchandise. We are awaiting proofs from their designers to present to the community, and will as well be accepting submissions for designs.</li>
<li>Over 370 people have responded to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEXnqD1sNHz9cslkMNOk6krUtDdSCYbxL68TTsn7uGZnoSFQ/viewform">form for registering volunteers</a> and supporters.</li>
<li>A blog and mailing list for future announcements and community updates is in development.</li>
<li>We have outgrown Slack due to the size of the community and required feature sets, and will therefore be migrating to <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>. This open source platform has a number of features we’ll be taking advantage of, including: an IRC bridge, multi-factor authentication, advanced logging / auditing / security capabilities, and fidelity in channel and access permissions.</li>
<li>Social media following:
<ul>
<li>4.3K active members on Slack</li>
<li>169 followers on <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/rockylinux">LinkedIn</a> with 1.3K post impressions</li>
<li>4K followers on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a> with an average of 22K impressions and 3575 interactions per tweet</li>
<li>3K members in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RockyLinux">/r/RockyLinux on Reddit</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Interest Groups (SIG)</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have received a number of requests for SIGs on a variety of different topics:
<ul>
<li>Desktop / Laptop</li>
<li>Enhanced Security</li>
<li>Kubernetes / Cloud Native</li>
<li>Minimal Install / OS Bootstrap</li>
<li>Storage appliance</li>
<li>HPC and next generation HPC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The evolution of a SIG should result in optional package repositories and/or custom installers.</li>
<li>We will need leaders for SIGs as well as proposals.</li>
<li>Timelines for these proposals will be coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: Rocky Linux is first and foremost a freely available Enterprise Linux clone. SIGs will optionally enhance that base and provide extra packages and capabilities to that stable base. At no point will a SIG affect the default core of Rocky Linux.</em></p>
<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a number of companies who have stepped up to sponsor the Rocky Linux Foundation in the form of developers, hardware, cloud instances, and money.</li>
<li>Sponsorship will have different levels, and we are happy to speak with organizations interested in helping.</li>
<li>All contributors will be publicly thanked on our website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Rocky Linux Foundation, Inc. has been registered as a legal not-for-profit entity in the United States (Delaware).</li>
<li>An application for 501(​c)(3) non-profit status will be submitted as we mature and can afford the legal representation to do so.</li>
<li>We are considering licensing for our data that will enable the greatest flexibility for our community. At present, the team is leaning towards the 3 Clause BSD license, but community input is welcome on this decision.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Localization</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category</a> has been created on our forums, with many people interested in helping with translations to a number of languages including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Afrikaans, Greek, Turkish, and many more.</li>
<li>We will be working to ensure future newsletters are translated to as many languages as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an interest in assisting with translations, please reach out via the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/c/localization/10">localization category of our forums</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, this wouldn’t at all be possible without <em>you</em>. We’re immensely grateful for the community’s enthusiasm, excitement, and help. Rocky Linux is, and will  remain a community-driven effort.</p>

December 23, 2020 | https://motley-coder.com/2020/12/23/doom-on-roku/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://motley-coder.com/2020/12/23/doom-on-roku/">archive.org</a>

<p>It’s all fine and dandy to <a href="https://motley-coder.com/2020/12/20/webassembly-on-roku/">say you got C compiling for the Roku</a>, but can you really in good conscience claim that C works if you haven’t got DOOM running?</p>



<p>If you want to see the end result, <a href="https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=doom">click here to play DOOM on your Roku</a>. And if you’d like to see the source, visit the <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">wasm2brs</a> project and check out the samples directory where you’ll find DOOM:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs</a></p>



<p>When it came to picking an implementation of DOOM, I decided to go with the SDL port because I’m familiar with the SDL API. Before even trying to get it running on the Roku I wanted to see it running on my local machine.</p>



<p>Several segmentation faults later, I realized that the original DOOM code made a lot of assumptions about the size of a pointer being 32 bit and my default compiler was set to compile in 64 bit. Eventually that led me to <a href="https://github.com/makava/sdldoom-1.10-mod">this modification of the SDL port</a>. The user <a href="https://github.com/makava">makava</a> provided the command line arguments I needed to get a running version on my PC, and from there I was confident I could make it run on Roku!</p>



<h2>WASI WAD file</h2>



<p>Before getting any graphical or audio output, our first goal is to get the game loading. All of the textures, sounds, levels, text, etc that DOOM loads comes from their proprietary format, the .WAD file. What’s more impressive is that the same engine can run DOOM and DOOM2, and many other flavors. It does this in the function <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs/blob/a4f2e7ffa6b1d577d010e0423e77b534cd0db121/samples/doom/src/d_main.c#L551">IdentifyVersion</a> by scanning for the existence of any of the known .WAD file names. In our case, we’re using <code>doom1.wad</code> because that’s the shareware / demo version of the original DOOM.</p>



<p>By default, it checks if the environment variable <code>DOOMWADDIR</code> is present, and if not it uses the relative path of <code>./doom1.wad</code>. Because I use <em>wasienv</em> as a convenience to compile WebAssembly programs that target <em>wasi-libc</em>, they include a <code>preamble.h</code> that defines <a href="https://github.com/wasienv/wasienv/blob/6be5a222a9fea986f000a05842ddf45bc085a2b2/wasienv/stubs/preamble.h#L60">getcwd as returning an empty string</a>. In the case of Roku, when opening a file it must begin with the device, such as <code>pkg:/</code>, and since our working directory was empty, the relative path <code><code>./doom1.wad</code></code> did not resolve to a proper Roku path. The simplest fix was to set <code>DOOMWADDIR</code> to <code>pkg:/source</code> and place the <code>doom1.wad</code> in the <code>source</code> directory. It should be noted that as of November 30th 2020, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/214">wasi-libc now has emulation of getcwd</a>.</p>



<h2>The Clock</h2>



<p>Our second goal is to put a print statement in the main loop and show that frames are indeed being processed. In the SDL port, every frame it would call <code>SDL_GetTicks</code> to determine how much time had passed. In DOOM there are 35 ticks per second, which is defined by <code>TICRATE</code>.</p>



<p>Luckily, <em>wasi-libc</em> has an implementation of <code>clock_gettime</code> which in turn calls our implementation of <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1_clock_time_get</code>. On the Roku, we used the <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdatetime.md">ifDateTime</a> to compute milliseconds and seconds. Our minor change in DOOM now looks like:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">struct timespec spec;
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;spec);
int ms = spec.tv_sec * 1000 + spec.tv_nsec / 1000000;
return (ms * TICRATE) / 1000;</pre>



<p>What was even more exciting, at this point I added a print here and sure enough when I ran it on the Roku I saw it getting called every frame!</p>



<h2>Pixel Buffer 1: Drawing Rectangles as Pixels</h2>



<p>When I first started playing with graphics on Roku, I was surprised to find that BrightScript has no exposed functions to upload an array of pixels to a texture. The primary drawing interface is <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdraw2d.md">ifDraw2D</a> which is akin to the HTML canvas element. They even have <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdraw2d.md#getbytearrayx-as-integer-y-as-integer-width-as-integer-height-as-integer-as-object">GetByteArray(…)</a>, but sadly no SetByteArray.</p>



<p>By default with no scaling, DOOM runs at a resolution of 320×200 which is 64,000 pixels. I’m a fan of going for the slowest brute force approach first, but unfortunately this was the only approach I could think of. Rather than setting individual pixels, we could draw a single 1×1 rectangle for each pixel using <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdraw2d.md#drawrectx-as-integer-y-as-integer-width-as-integer-height-as-integer-rgba-as-integer-as-void">DrawRect(…)</a>.</p>



<p>This approach was slower than I could have imagined. I achieved about 3-4 frames per second on my TCL 7137X with an ARM dual core 1.2 GHz processor. That doesn’t leave any time for the game logic and rendering. We’re looping over every pixel, loading memory to get the color of the pixel, and calling <code>DrawRect</code>.</p>



<p>I also found an internal limitation where it seems they are using an unsigned 16 bit integer for the number of draw calls. Beyond 65,535 calls to <code>DrawRect</code> it would discard all the original calls. Keep in mind 320×200 is 64,000 so you can’t get much bigger than that.</p>



<p>Overall this approach was a bust. I needed to put my thinking cap on to come up with another way to make a pixel buffer.</p>



<h2>Pixel Buffer 2: Reading BMP Files From The Disk</h2>



<p>That’s right, you read that correctly. If the first approach above seemed at least reasonable, this approach usually makes people’s jaw drop.</p>



<p>BrightScript again has no interface to upload binary image data, but they do have <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/robitmap.md">roBitmap</a> whose constructor can take a file path to an image. Moreover, the <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md">ifByteArray</a> has methods to write a portion of the array to disk, namely the second overload of <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md#writefilepath-as-string-start_index-as-integer-length-as-integer-as-boolean">WriteFile</a> and <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md#appendfilepath-as-string-start_pos-as-integer-length-as-integer-as-boolean">AppendFile</a>. The fact that it takes an offset and length is a huge win, because it means we can implement a <em>zero copy</em> pixel buffer… at least if you consider that we don’t have to loop over the pixels ourselves in BrightScript which is extremely slow.</p>



<p>Moreover, as I dug into writing files on Roku I found <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/file-system.md">this documentation</a> which tells us that the <code>tmp:/</code> storage device is most likely in memory due to it discarding contents when the app exits. That means writes and reads to this device will be very quick!</p>



<p>And this final details takes the cake. I was trying to figure out what image format I wanted to write… uncompressed PNG maybe? Ideally it had be a format that I didn’t need to do any transformation of the pixel data to store. In other words, DOOM’s internal screen should be directly writable to the disk / pixel data section of the image, with no modification or looping over pixels.</p>



<p>DOOM uses 8 bits per pixel (single byte) and a 256 color palette. That’s when I remembered that Microsoft’s BMP format supports 8 bit color. To my excitement, DOOM’s screen format could be directly written out as a section of the BMP, as well as the color palette!</p>



<p>For a test, I created a 320×200 bitmap with 256 colors and timed how many I could load in one second. Obviously it’s possible Roku could have some caching behavior, however I was able to get about 125 fps with each one taking from 7 to 8 milliseconds:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2466" data-permalink="https://motley-coder.com/2020/12/23/doom-on-roku/bitmap_256_color/" data-orig-file="https://motley-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bitmap_256_color.bmp" data-orig-size="320,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="bitmap_256_color" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://motley-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bitmap_256_color.bmp" data-large-file="https://motley-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bitmap_256_color.bmp" loading="lazy" width="320" height="200" src="https://motley-coder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bitmap_256_color.bmp" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>That was a great static test, but dynamic was bound to be slower since we’re writing a file each time. As an optimization, I would build the bitmap header once and store it in its own <code>roByteArray</code>. Roughly, the 256 color BMP format looks like:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">54 bytes of headers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">256 bytes of color palette</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">320 * 200 bytes of pixels</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Example_1">has much better examples</a>, though without a palette. For writing the headers, I was able to use a lot of the WebAssembly instructions I already implemented:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">' Header
I32Store8(headers, &amp;H00, &amp;H42) 'B
I32Store8(headers, &amp;H01, &amp;H4D) 'M
I32Store(headers, &amp;H02, fileSize) ' FileSize
I32Store(headers, &amp;H06, 0) ' Reserved
I32Store(headers, &amp;H0A, dataOffset) ' DataOffset

'InfoHeader
I32Store(headers, &amp;H0E, 40) ' InfoHeader Size
I32Store(headers, &amp;H12, width) ' Width
I32Store(headers, &amp;H16, height) ' Height
I32Store16(headers, &amp;H1A, 1) ' Planes
I32Store16(headers, &amp;H1C, bitsPerPixel) ' BitsPerPixel
I32Store(headers, &amp;H1E, 0) ' Compression (BI_RGB No compression)
I32Store(headers, &amp;H22, 0) ' ImageSize (0 is valid for no compression)
I32Store(headers, &amp;H26, 2835) ' XpixelsPerM
I32Store(headers, &amp;H2A, 2835) ' YpixelsPerM
I32Store(headers, &amp;H2E, usedColors) ' UsedColors
I32Store(headers, &amp;H32, 0) ' ImportantColors</pre>



<p>And Finally for both writing and immediately reading the data into an <code>roBitmap</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">path = "tmp:/s"
m.surfaceHeaders.WriteFile(path)
If m.surfaceColorTable &lt;&gt; Invalid Then m.surfaceColorTable.AppendFile(path)
m.wasi_memory.AppendFile(path, pixelDataOffset, m.surfacePixelDataSize)
bitmap = CreateObject("roBitmap", path)
m.screen.DrawScaledObject(0, m.surfaceHeight, 1, -1, bitmap)
m.screen.SwapBuffers()</pre>



<p>In this case <code>m.screen</code> is an instance of an <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roscreen.md">roScreen</a>, which implements <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdraw2d.md">ifDraw2D</a>, so effectively it’s a full screen canvas. The <code>m.surfaceColorTable</code> is the color palette, and <code>m.wasi_memory</code> is actually the entire memory of DOOM, of which we’re only writing a tiny portion which is the pixel data (<code>screen[0]</code> if you’re familiar with the DOOM source).</p>



<p>You might notice the call to <code>DrawScaledObject</code>; that’s because as I found out bitmaps actually store their rows in reverse order where the first row is the bottom of the image. In DOOM, the first row is the top of the image, hence the flip. I found out later BMP format actually has a mechanism to support both ways, by storing a negative number for height.</p>



<p>To make these functions readily callable from C was straightforward in <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">wasm2brs</a>. By default we compile with <code>-Wl,--allow-undefined</code> and any undefined function is assumed to be defined by Roku. It’s important to remember that in WebAssembly, all pointers are integers, so the following functions (taken from our <code>roku.h</code>):</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void roku_create_surface(int bitsPerPixel, int w, int h);
void roku_set_surface_colors(void* colorTable);
void roku_draw_surface(void* pixelData);</pre>



<p>Defined in BrightScript look like (taken from our <code>roku.brs</code>):</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Function roku_create_surface(bitsPerPixel As Integer, w As Integer, h As Integer) as Void
Function roku_set_surface_colors(colorTableOffset as Integer) as Void
Function roku_draw_surface(pixelDataOffset As Integer) as Void</pre>



<p>To my amazement when we called the above functions from DOOM’s <code>i_video.c</code>, it actually worked! After DOOM got through loading the WAD file, the intro screen popped up and it blew my mind.</p>



<h2>Input</h2>



<p>Every iteration of the DOOM loop pumps all available messages from the operating system and stores them in queue. Lucky for us that translates pretty well to the non-blocking BrightScript <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifmessageport.md#getmessage-as-dynamic">roPort.GetMessage()</a>. Moreover, by using an <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/roscreen.md">roScreen</a> we now receive the <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/events/rouniversalcontrolevent.md">roUniversalControl…</a></p></div></div>

Scientists from the United States, China and Russia have described the structure and properties of a novel hydrogen clathrate hydrate that forms at room temperature and relatively low pressure. Hydrogen hydrates are a potential solution for storage and transportation of hydrogen, the most environmentally friendly fuel.&nbsp;</p><p>The research was <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.aps.org%2Fprl%2Fabstract%2F10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.125.255702&amp;t=NzI1NDZjNTUzNGYzZTcwMzhkMDRjZjkzODUyMzIzODVjMTRiNDM0MyxDS1BDanZQZQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638336664435097600%2Fnew-ice-form&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002151">published</a> in the journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i>.

<br></p><p>Ice is a highly complex substance that has multiple polymorphic modifications that keep growing in number as scientists make new discoveries. The physical properties of ice vary greatly, too: for example, hydrogen bonds become symmetric at high pressures, making it impossible to distinguish a single water molecule, whereas low pressures cause proton disorder, placing water molecules in many possible spatial orientations within the crystal structure. Ice around us, including snowflakes, is always proton-disordered. Ice can incorporate xenon, chlorine, carbon dioxide or methane molecules and form gas hydrates which often have a different structure from pure ice. The vast bulk of Earth’s natural gas exists in the form of gas hydrates.</p><p>In their new study, chemists from the United States, China and Russia focused on hydrogen hydrates. Gas hydrates hold great interest both for theoretical research and practical applications, such as hydrogen storage. If stored in its natural form, hydrogen poses an explosion hazard, whereas density is way too low even in compressed hydrogen. That is why scientists are looking for cost-effective hydrogen storage solutions.</p><p>“This is not the first time we turn to hydrogen hydrates. In our previous research, we <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fsrep05606%3Ftrendmd-shared%3D0&amp;t=ZGMxOGZkMDZhN2I3YmQ5NWI4YWJmYTU0NGEyYTdhMzc0NGFmNzYxYixDS1BDanZQZQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638336664435097600%2Fnew-ice-form&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002151">predicted</a> a novel hydrogen hydrate with 2 hydrogen molecules per water molecule. Unfortunately, this exceptional hydrate can only exist at pressures above 380,000 atmospheres, which is easy to achieve in the lab, but is hardly usable in practical applications. Our new paper describes hydrates that contain less hydrogen but can exist at much lower pressures,” Skoltech professor Artem R. Oganov says.<br></p><p>The crystal structure of hydrogen hydrates strongly depends on pressure. At low pressures, it has large cavities which, according to Oganov, resemble Chinese lanterns, each accommodating hydrogen molecules. As pressure increases, the structure becomes denser, with more hydrogen molecules packed into the crystal structure, although their degrees of freedom become significantly fewer.</p><p>In their research published in the <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, the scientists from the Carnegie Institution of Washington (USA) and the Institute of Solid State Physics in Hefei (China) led by Alexander F. Goncharov, a Professor at these two institutions, performed experiments to study the properties of various hydrogen hydrates and discovered an unusual hydrate with 3 water molecules per hydrogen molecule. The team led by Professor Oganov used the USPEX evolutionary algorithm developed by Oganov and his students to puzzle out the compound’s structure responsible for its peculiar behavior. The researchers simulated the conditions used in the experiment and found a new structure very similar to the known proton-ordered C1 hydrate but differing from C1 in water molecule orientations. The team showed that proton disorder should occur at room temperature, thus explaining the X-ray diffraction and Raman spectrum data obtained in the experiment.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;A novel hydrogen clathrate hydrate.

                <div>
                    <p>On the surface, software engineering interviews look pretty much the same in any company. You usually have a phone call with a recruiter, followed by either a short technical round or a set of take home exercises. If you pass that you're invited for several rounds of on-site interviews, focusing on your technical abilities and behavioral cues that could predict your job performance and how you'll get along with the team.</p><p>However, if you simply take this format, pick a set of technical questions for the specific role and go with it, you could soon find yourself thinking about how to improve the process. You might find it slow and tedious for the interviewers; you could start seeing evaluations for the same candidate that widely differ depending on the interviewer; you could get feedback from the candidates that the process requires too much of a time investment for them.</p><p>In this post we'll summarize lessons shared on official engineering blogs of several companies. Namely, the advice falls down into three sections:</p><ol><li>Know what you are looking for</li><li>Be ready to iterate</li><li>Techniques to avoid bias</li></ol><p>If you're curious and want to find more stories about engineering interviews and hiring process, you should try <a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=engineering%20interviews">Blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="know-what-you-are-looking-for">Know what you are looking for</h2><p>You want to hire an engineer, and you want to hire a great one. But the exact definition of "great" can depend on many factors, so a one-size-fits-all list of traits is unlikely to exist. </p><p>Are you a big company or a startup, what's the current state of the project and the team, are you hiring for a junior or a senior role? These are some of the obvious things to consider when thinking about the best fit for the role. Once you're clear on this you can work out the details and the exact qualities you're looking for in a candidate. Finally, all this will determine what you screen for and what your interview scorecards need to look like.</p><p>In a Lyft Engineering blog post <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/how-lyft-designs-the-machine-learning-software-engineering-interview-bbbb9fc8bb28">How Lyft Designs the Machine Learning Software Engineering Interview</a>, Hao Yi Ong states the following three questions to ask in order to understand what you actually want from a role you're hiring for:</p><blockquote>1. What are Lyft’s challenges (and can a specific role help)?<br>2. What should the role be with respect to the organization’s goals?<br>3. What are the desired skills, knowledge, and talents given the expectations for the role?</blockquote><p>Companies are more or less transparent about detailed requirements for the roles. The above-mentioned article briefly describes them as follows:</p><blockquote>Our desired talents are <em><em>recurring patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior that can be productively applied</em></em> in the context of Lyft’s ML SWE role. What we’re looking for here is a bit more complicated than simply work done in the past by a candidate. Faced with the same stimuli, people react and behave differently. When we look for role and values fit, we do mean just that. Beyond skills and knowledge, will a candidate’s unique way of responding to the problems thrown up in Lyft’s business context help that candidate succeed? So while conventional wisdom might suggest it, we’re not always looking for the Michael Jordans of machine learning (be it I. or J.). The narrow sort of talents associated with celebrated excellence can be important but in most cases the interviewers are listening for predictive clues of how a candidate will react when posed Lyft-specific problems on the job.</blockquote><p>Speaking about high level qualities of successful engineers, here's what Ted Tomlinson of Databricks shares in his article <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/22/engineering-intervews-a-hiring-managers-guide.html">Engineering Interviews — A Hiring Manager’s Guide to Standing Out</a>:</p><blockquote>At a startup like Databricks, the most important quality I’ve seen in successful engineers is ownership. We are growing quickly, which brings a lot of new challenges every week, but it’s not always clear how responsibilities divide across teams and priorities get determined. Great engineers handle this ambiguity by surfacing the most impactful problems to work on, not just those limited to their current team’s responsibilities. Sometimes this means directly helping to build the solution, but often it’s motivating others to prioritize the work.<p>The second quality we focus on, particularly for those earlier in their career, is the ability to learn and grow. The derivative of knowledge is often more important than a candidate’s current technical skills. Many of the engineering problems we are solving don’t have existing templates to follow. That means continually breaking through layers of abstraction to consider the larger system – from the lowest level of cpu instructions, up to how visualizations are rendered in the browser.</p></blockquote><p>Going back to tailoring the requirements to the needs of your company, notice that Ted points out that <em>ownership</em> is <em>the most important quality at a startup like Databricks, </em>suggesting that wouldn't necessarily be equally important at a different place.</p><p>Once you've figured out the qualities you're looking for, you can go deeper and break them down into fine-grained categories that you can actually screen for in an interview. Medium Engineering shares a great example of how this can be done. In <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-what-we-screen-for-af2d84122417">Engineering interviews: what we screen for</a>, Jamie Talbot explains how at Medium they're looking for three things: (1) Can they build software? (2) Can they learn and teach? (3) Are they aligned with our values?</p><p>Each of these high level requirements is then broken down into six sub-categories. For example <em>ability to build software </em>covers the following categories:</p><ul><li>Problem solving</li><li>Code fluency</li><li>Autonomy</li><li>Basic computer science knowledge</li><li>System design</li><li>Resoluteness</li></ul><p>If you're curious, each capability is described in detail in the <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-what-we-screen-for-af2d84122417">blog post</a>. In addition to that, the team at Medium devised a detailed grading guideline for each category, helping interviewers decide on the scale of <em>Strong No &gt; No &gt; Mixed &gt; Yes &gt; Strong Yes. </em>They describe it in another article <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f">here</a>.</p><p>With any problem, hiring being no exception, it helps to know why you're doing it and what your environment and constraints are. Only then you can come up with creative and more effective solutions.</p><p>Speaking of constraints, they're likely to change over time, rendering your existing interview process inefficient.</p><h2 id="be-ready-to-iterate">Be ready to iterate</h2><p>There's several reasons for being flexible and ready to adapt your technical interview process. </p><p>In the previous part we discussed how you need to tailor your interviews to fit your company, project and team needs. Inevitably, these things will change over time, and with that your interview process will likely need to change as well.</p><p>On that note, when reading through company blogs a recurring theme is <em>redesign</em> of the interview process. It usually happens because circumstances change, but often (as with any process) you can find room for improvement even when the environment hasn't changed much. </p><p>At Medium they noticed more than a few things they thought need improvement. As elaborated in <a href="https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-refining-our-process-52fbc9510e91">Engineering interviews: refining our process</a> they wanted to address lack of clarity in capability requirements, inconsistencies in candidate evaluation, which traits are considered important and which less so, how they approach personality traits and non-technical qualities.</p><p>At The New York Times, they recognized the need to standardize the hiring process across the company, as it's recognized to be the key determining factor for the culture. One of the things where a consolidated interview process helped is increased trust for internal mobility. Due to lack of trust among teams, it could happen that an engineer would be required to pass a technical interview if they were to change teams. You can read about this on the NYT Open, the official behind-the-scenes blog of The New York Times (namely these two articles: <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-designed-our-front-end-engineer-hiring-process-9b8f20cc31fb">How We Designed Our Front-End Engineer Hiring Process</a>, <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-hire-front-end-engineers-at-the-new-york-times-e1294ea8e3f8">How We Hire Front-End Engineers at The New York Times</a>).</p><p>In <a href="https://slack.engineering/refactoring-backend-engineering-hiring-at-slack/">Refactoring Backend Engineering Hiring at Slack</a>, Slack engineers share the story of why and how they optimized the take-home exercise. Although it had many points in its favor, the exercise was a bottleneck in their hiring process. Candidates, wanting to show off the best of their skills, would take too much time to complete the exercise. Slack, on the other hand, was in state of rapid growth and the projected time for staffing all the necessary positions simply was too long:</p><blockquote>The end result was that, by our estimates, it would have taken a year to fill our existing open headcount, future growth aside. This timeframe clearly would not allow us to grow at the speed we needed. However, we were also unwilling to sacrifice quality. We needed an approach that would give us good signal and help us hire great engineers, but at a reduced time cost to the candidate and to us. <p>To satisfy these needs, we decided to create two new take-home exercises: an API design exercise and a code review exercise. In creating these exercises, we sought to create a problem that was not an onerous time investment on the part of the candidate. We wanted something that would give us good signal on the attributes we cared about while taking at most two hours to complete.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, the team at Slack came up with a new format for the challenge as well as internal apps and GitHub automations to streamline the process, resulting in significant measurable improvement:</p><blockquote>In the end, we saw tangible improvements against our goals. We saw a decrease in our time-to-hire — the time from when a recruiter first reaches out, to the candidate’s first day in the office. The time-to-hire metric decreased from an average of 200 days to below 83 days — and it continues to drop. We’ve seen positive feedback from candidates and employees in all parts of the process.</blockquote><p>At Soundcloud, the team attacked the same part of the interview funnel - the take-home exercise, since they noticed it often takes far too long to complete it. As they point out <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/rethinking-the-backend-code-challenge#fnref-1">in this article</a>, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>For the source code, visit my github: <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs</a></p>



<p>I’ve been of huge fan of the TCL + Roku series of TVs. I’m a simple person with simple pleasures, and the button on the remote that instantly turns on the TV and goes to Netflix won me over. As with most technology, it didn’t take long for me to start tinkering.</p>



<p>Roku’s app development platform requires that all apps are written in a proprietary language known as BrightScript. It’s a dynamic language with limited optional types. After playing in BrightScript for a bit, I found myself searching “<em>How to compile C++ for Roku?</em>” only to realize that C++ support was discontinued or locked behind partnerships and NDAs.</p>



<h2>Path to C/C++ in BrightScript</h2>



<p>Up front I knew I was going to need to do some translating. The immediate options available were:</p>



<ul><li>C++ directly to BrightScript</li><li>C++ to LLVM bitcode to BrightScript</li><li>C++ to WebAssembly to BrightScript</li></ul>







<p>Translation of the C++ AST provided by clang was a no-go due to the complexity of having to convert classes, operators, templates, etc. LLVM looked attractive because it boils down to basic instructions, pointers, and structs, and is a supported output by many languages. Ultimately I chose WebAssembly over LLVM bitcode because the number of instructions was smaller, there is no concept of structs (only bytes), pointers are just integers with no special type, and the linear memory model for WASM was simple.</p>



<p>When I started, I looked for a parser for .wasm files which led me to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>, The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit. My first approach was going to be parse the .wasm, walk over instructions, generate variables, and emit BrightScript. This proved to be a little more complicated than I expected as I didn’t fully understand the type and label stack, or even how the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html#syntax-instr-control">br</a> instruction jumps <em>after</em> the block, instead of to it like in LLVM. However in the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a> repository I came across <em>wasm2c</em>, a simple command line interface for translating WebAssembly into C. This gave me a clearer picture of the workings of WebAssembly and a template to work from, now called <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">wasm2brs</a> for WebAssembly To BrightScript. All I needed to do was modify the output of <em>wasm2c</em> to match BrightScript syntax.</p>



<h2>First Run</h2>



<p>To start I picked a simple example of adding integers with no imports, memory, globals, etc. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a> tool <em>wat2wasm</em> to convert this into a .wasm file:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(func (export "add") (param $x i32) (param $y i32) (result i32)
    (i32.add
        (local.get $x)
        (local.get $y)
    )
)</pre>



<p>In fact it was so useful to be able to run on both .wat and .wasm files that I ended up integrating the source of <em>wat2wasm</em> into <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">wasm2brs</a>.</p>



<p>After some slight modification of the original <em>wasm2c</em> project, I was able to output the following BrightScript:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Function w2b_add(w2b_x As Integer, w2b_y As Integer) As Integer
  w2b_i0 = w2b_x
  w2b_i1 = w2b_y
  w2b_i0 += w2b_i1
  Return w2b_i0
End Function</pre>







<p>Ta-da! It actually worked and produced valid code that ran on the Roku. I was ecstatic at this point, but I was also piggybacking on the fact that <em>wasm2c</em> was able to use all of C’s built in operators such as <code>+=</code> which happens to exist in BrightScript.</p>



<h2>Memory</h2>



<p>Though I would love to see more added to BrightScript’s standard library, the component <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md">roByteArray</a> would serve nicely as our basis for implementing WebAssembly’s memory model. As a side note, <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md">roByteArray</a> is simply an object, but for the documentation of all of its functions you must look at all the interfaces it implements, with <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md">ifByteArray</a> being one of them. Unfortunately as you might notice by scanning the interface, the only methods they have to reading and writing to it involve reading single bytes with the index[n] operator or <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md#getsignedbyteindex-as-integer-as-integer">GetSignedByte(n)</a>. There is no similar functions to JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView">DataView</a> where you can call <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView/getInt32">getInt32(n)</a> and read a 32 bit integer. At best they have <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifbytearray.md#getsignedlongindex-as-integer-as-integer">GetSignedLong(n)</a>, except that it’s undocumented that <code>n</code> in this case actually jumps by 4 bytes (<code>index = n * 4</code>). This means it does not support unaligned loads, which is required by WebAssembly.</p>



<p>This presented a problem: we’re going to have to do everything in bytes. Roku employees, if you’re reading this, please add all the methods from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView">DataView</a> :)</p>



<p>To implement <em>i32.load</em> which loads a 32 bit integer from memory, I modified <a href="https://github.com/TrevorSundberg/wasm2brs">wasm2brs</a> to emit a function call to the following:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Function I32Load(mem as Object, index as Integer) as Integer
    Return mem[index] + (mem[index + 1] &lt;&lt; 8) + (mem[index + 2] &lt;&lt; 16) + (mem[index + 3] &lt;&lt; 24)
End Function</pre>



<p>Luckily BrightScript has logical bit-shift built in and I was able to read 4 bytes and shift them all into place. At the time, I didn’t realize that BrightScript also had the bitwise-or operator (literally <code>Or</code>) as I tried the typical C <code>|</code> operator and it failed, so I opted to use <code>+</code> instead.</p>



<h2>Testing Instructions</h2>



<p>What became immediately clear was that I needed a way to know whether my WASM instruction implementations were correct. For example, unsigned i32 division is different than signed i32 division, and BrightScript only supported signed integral types. How would I know my implementation was correct without coming up with all the pathological cases to test?</p>



<p>Again, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a> to the rescue! It was by luck that I noticed they had a sub-repository <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite">WebAssembly/testsuite</a> which contained a massive set of WebAssembly .wast files that tested the behavior of each instruction. For those familiar with WebAssembly, a .wast is just a .wat file with extra syntax for testing. For example, you could test the unsigned i32 division by using the test file <em>i32.wast</em>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 1) (i32.const 1)) (i32.const 1))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 0) (i32.const 1)) (i32.const 0))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const -1) (i32.const -1)) (i32.const 1))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 0x80000000) (i32.const -1)) (i32.const 0))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 0x80000000) (i32.const 2)) (i32.const 0x40000000))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 0x8ff00ff0) (i32.const 0x10001)) (i32.const 0x8fef))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 0x80000001) (i32.const 1000)) (i32.const 0x20c49b))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 5) (i32.const 2)) (i32.const 2))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const -5) (i32.const 2)) (i32.const 0x7ffffffd))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 5) (i32.const -2)) (i32.const 0))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const -5) (i32.const -2)) (i32.const 0))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 7) (i32.const 3)) (i32.const 2))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 11) (i32.const 5)) (i32.const 2))
(assert_return (invoke "div_u" (i32.const 17) (i32.const 7)) (i32.const 2))</pre>



<p>After implementing <code>assert_return</code> in BrightScript and creating a framework that read .wast files using the <em>wast2json</em> tool, I had a way to progress forward:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="visualbasic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">result = test0_div_u(1%,1%) ' i32.wast(87) current.json(50)
AssertEquals(result, 1%)
result = test0_div_u(0%,1%) ' i32.wast(88) current.json(51)
AssertEquals(result, 0%)
result = test0_div_u(4294967295%,4294967295%) ' i32.wast(89) current.json(52)
AssertEquals(result, 1%)

AssertEquals(result, 0%)
result = test0_div_u(2147483648%,2%) ' i32.wast(91) current.json(54)
AssertEquals(result, 1073741824%)
result = test0_div_u(2414874608%,65537%) ' i32.wast(92) current.json(55)
AssertEquals(result, 36847%)
result = test0_div_u(2147483649%,1000%) ' i32.wast(93) current.json(56)
AssertEquals(result, 2147483%)
result = test0_div_u(5%,2%) ' i32.wast(94) current.json(57)
AssertEquals(result, 2%)
result = test0_div_u(4294967291%,2%) ' i32.wast(95) current.json(58)
AssertEquals(result, 2147483645%)
result = test0_div_u(5%,4294967294%) ' i32.wast(96) current.json(59)
AssertEquals(result, 0%)
result = test0_div_u(4294967291%,4294967294%) ' i32.wast(97) current.json(60)

<p>My mission became clear: work through each .wast file and implement all the instructions until 100% of the tests pass.</p>



<h2>Unsigned i32 Operations</h2>



<p>One thing that I learned is that there is no difference between unsigned and signed addition (I believe due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two’s Complement</a>, but don’t quote me on that). For example if you were to take the expression:</p>



<pre><code>-123 + 20 = -103</code></pre>



<p>Reinterpret the first two operands as unsigned you would get:</p>



<pre><code>FFFFFF85 + 00000014</code></pre>



<p>When added they result in:</p>



<pre><code>FFFFFF99</code></pre>



<p>Which if you reinterpret that back as signed you get:</p>



<pre><code>-103</code></pre>



<p>However, the same cannot be said for unsigned division which is exactly why WebAssembly has the <em>i32.div_u</em> and <em>i32.div_s</em> instructions. In the land of unsigned, it’s very clear to see that:</p>



<pre><code>00000001 / FFFFFFFF = 00000000</code></pre>



<p>The number 00000001 (or just 1) divided by a very large number of 0xFFFFFFFF is clearly 0 due to integer division. However if you reinterpret those same operands as i32 signed values, you get:</p>



<pre><code>1 / -1 = -1</code></pre>



<p>This presents us with a problem: BrightScript does not have unsigned primitives and therefore does not have a way to run an unsigned i32 division operation. It’s time to get clever… Trevor (I make no apologies for this).</p>



<p>We can take advantage of the fact that the entire range of an unsigned i32 fits within a signed i64. The tricky part is in BrightScript, all conversions from Integer to LongInteger are done via sign extension. That means that the value 0xFFFFFFFF would turn into 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, because 0xFFFFFFFF interpreted as signed is -1, and -1 in 64 bit is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.</p>



<p>There is a simple fix: we use <em>bitwise and</em> to discard the high 4 bytes and keep only the low 4 bytes after performing the sign extension. This …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The goal of this article is to convey an approach to solving data structure and
algorithm problems. My hope is that it helps you in a situation where you might
otherwise draw a blank.</p>
<p>I want to start by stating an obvious but important truth: your brain is
<strong>amazing</strong>. You are constantly and rapidly solving unimaginably complex
problems that make even the most challenging FAANG whiteboard interview look
like a stroll in the park. Steven Pinker expresses this idea eloquently in <em>How
The Mind Works</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the gap between robots in imagination and in reality…shows the first
step we must take in knowing ourselves: appreciating the fantastically complex
design behind feats of mental life we take for granted. The reason there are
no humanlike robots is not that the very idea of a mechanical mind is
misguided. It is that the engineering problems that we humans solve as we see
and walk and plan and make it through the day are far more challenging than
landing on the moon or sequencing the human genome. Nature, once again, has
found ingenious solutions that human engineers cannot yet duplicate. When
Hamlet says, “What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite
in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable!” we should direct
our awe not at Shakespeare or Mozart or Einstein or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but at
a four-year old carrying out a request to put a toy on a shelf.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinker goes on to say that the “faculty with which we ponder the world has no
ability to peer inside itself or our other faculties to see what makes them
tick.” I beg to differ. In Pinker’s defense, he may be using hyperbole to
accentuate his point.</p>
<p>We are all students of the mind – simultaneously scientist and lab rat. When we
make consciousness the subject of consciousness, we can pull back the veil and
bear witness to the built-in algorithms that are otherwise taken for granted.</p>
<p>This process can be leveraged to help demystify data structure and algorithm
questions. Let’s walk through a specific problem to illustrate the concept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Implement strStr().</p>
<p>Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle
is not part of haystack.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty
string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/">https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/</a></p>
<p>First and foremost, you need example input. If it’s not provided by default,
either ask for it or define your own inputs.</p>
<p>In this case, Leetcode provides us with example input:</p>
<pre><code>Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
</code></pre><p><strong>Resist</strong> the temptation to write code.</p>
<p>This stage is not about coding, it’s about observing and deconstructing how your
mind arrives at a solution.</p>
<p>Can you determine, at a glance, whether or not “hello” contains “ll”? Of course
you can. It does. This conclusion seems to materialize instantaneously, doesn’t
it? It also seems to require little to no effort. Take a moment here to
appreciate just how effective your mind is at this task.</p>
<p>The operative question is: how? More specifically, how <strong>does</strong> your mind solve it?
The crux of this article is that you should focus on that question as opposed
to the categorically different question of: how <strong>should</strong> you solve this?</p>
<p>When I slow down and observe how my mind tackles this problem, I arrive at the
following deconstruction. It seems as if my mind identifies the length of the
needle, then iterates through the haystack, making needle-sized chunks as it
goes, comparing each chunk to the needle for equality.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, it looks something like this:</p>
<p>Does “he” equal “ll”? No.</p>
<p>Does “el” equal “ll”? No.</p>
<p>Does “ll” equal “ll”? Yes!</p>
<p>Now it’s just a matter of identifying the matching index, which is 2.</p>
<p>Simple enough, right?</p>
<p>We can probably dissect it further using three pointers but for the sake of
brevity I’ll sidestep the added complexity.</p>
<p>Now that we have a proposed explanation for how the mind solves this problem,
translating it into code is comparatively trivial.</p>
<p>Avoid premature optimization at this stage. Sometimes, the mind’s approach is
efficient; other times it is inefficient and you can improve on it. Either way,
defer optimization. First make it work, then make it better. An inefficient
solution is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Here is a pretty simple implementation of the process outlined above in Python.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Solution</span>:
    <span>def</span> <span>strStr</span>(self, haystack: str, needle: str) <span>-&gt;</span> int:
        haystack_length <span>=</span> len(haystack) <span>-</span> <span>1</span>
        needle_length <span>=</span> len(needle) <span>-</span> <span>1</span>
        i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

        <span>while</span> i <span>&lt;=</span> haystack_length <span>-</span> needle_length: 
            <span>if</span> haystack[i:i <span>+</span> needle_length <span>+</span> <span>1</span>] <span>==</span> needle:
                <span>return</span> i
            i <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
            
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In a nutshell, this implementation starts at the first element of haystack,
creates a needle-sized slice, and compares the slice to the needle for equality.
If equality is confirmed, it returns the index. If not, the index is iterated
and the slice and comparison is repeated starting from the next element. This
process continues until an equality check succeeds or the index reaches
<code>haystack_length - needle_length</code>, since any slice past that point will not be
long enough to match the needle in size.</p>
<p>The time and space complexity are both O(n).</p>
<p>I hope you found this helpful. Remember: your brain is amazing. If you can solve
a problem without code, you already know the solution, it’s just a matter of
unboxing it.</p>

		<p>A closer look at the glyphs drawn by the DEC terminals VT100 and VT220.</p>
		<p><span>R</span>ecently, I engaged in a bit of analog media emulation, namely for the purpose of the reenactment of raster CRT graphics as seen on “glass terminals” like the iconic VT-series by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). An endeavor, which raises a few questions, like, is there anything special to the media, what did the fonts really look like, and can we reconstruct them from specifications? </p>

		<figure>

			<figcaption><em>(Not a DEC manual.)</em></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Thanks to a tiny wealth of technical information available on the web, at sites like <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/terminal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitsavers.org</a>, determining the look of these fonts should be easy. E.g., we may reconstruct the glyphs from the terminals’ ROMs. This way, we should be able to determine their exact forms. There are even TrueType-fonts available, meant to recreate the typography of the VT220, “<a href="http://sensi.org/~svo/glasstty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glass TTY VT220</a>,” including scanlines, and “<a href="https://www.dafont.com/dec-terminal-modern.font" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEC Terminal Modern</a>” with modernized, smooth outlines:</p>


		<figure>

			<figcaption>Modern TrueType fonts recreating the glyphs of the VT220.<br>Mind that the VT-terminals supported two resolution modes, one at 132 characters per line and one at 80 characters (char-matrix 9×10 and 10×10, respectively), the latter introducing an extra spacing of one pixel.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Having a closer look at the two fonts, there are some notable differences (the differences in spacing may be explained by the two characters per line modes of the VT-terminals), however, neither looks right. Comparing them to photos of the similar VT100, there are discernible differences, not only in the font weight, but also in the size and form of the conters and the overal “feel” of the font. However, the apparent confusion about the weight of the font isn’t especially helped by photos of the real thing either, as the impression conveyed by them differs widely by lens, exposure and camera settings used:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Since photos aren’t much of a help here either, it may be time for a look at the…</p>

		<h2>ROMs</h2>

		<p>Since ROMs are available, we may start there, since they are the closest, we may get, to the real thing, aren’t they? What could possibly go wrong?</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-roms.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 separated characters as in ROM" width="558" height="410">
			<figcaption><p>Separated ROM readings of the VT100 (left) and the VT220 (right).<br><cite>VT220 separation by Paul Flo Williams, <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a> (2008). VT100 complemented by me, N.L.</cite></p>
			<p>Character definitions differ for “a”, “c”, “g”, “2”, “6”, “7”, “9”, “@”, “%”, “{”, “}”, “|”, “°” and in the forms of the control characters (␉ ␍ ␊ ␤ ␋). Moreover, there are additional characters on the VT220.</p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Now, this doesn’t look right either. Obviously, the glyphs will be rendered stretched vertically to about double height, but there’s more going on here. The characters just don’t look right. P.e., have a closer look at “p” and “q” or the offset in the dots of the downward right stroke of “k”, not to speak of the funny digits “6” and “9” of the VT100 or the distorted “2”! Moreover, at a closer look, the character matrix is just 8×10, while we expected at least 9×10 (and 10×10 for 80-cols mode) — as described in the specifications. Clearly, this is not what is displayed on the screen.</p>

		<h2>Phosphor</h2>
		<p>Let’s have another look at the manuals, specifically at the “<a href="https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-tm/ek-vt100-tm-002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VT100 Series Technical Manual</a>” <cite>(2<sup>nd</sup> edition, EK-VT100-TM-002; DEC, Maynard, Massachsetts, Aug. 1979)</cite>. As we learn there, it’s all about phosphor latency:</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-phosphor-flanks.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 phosphor latency" width="743" height="390">
			<figcaption><p>Pulse widths and phosphor activation flanks for the VT100 and VT200.<br><cite>(VT100 Series Technical Manual, EK-VT100-TM-002, p. 4-78)</cite></p>
			<p>Mind that the flanks of the signal pulses are highly idealized and will be also sloped in analog real life.</p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>The time it takes for the phosphor to become fully activated is actually longer than the pulse representing the timing to draw a single pixel (40 nanoseconds). Meaning, if we were to attempt to display just a single pixel, the phosphor on this particular spot will never reach its full activation level resulting in a fuzzy image of varying brightnesses between dimmer, thin strokes and heavier, thick strokes. So the typography has to adjust for this, by streching the pulses to double width (80 ns), at least, in order to provide an even image and legible text and to work around the shallow flanks of the screen intensification.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-monitor-repsonse.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 monitor response" width="800" height="250">
			<figcaption>Single and double pixel-widths, pulse timing and phosphor activation.<br><cite>(As above, re-edited N.L.)</cite></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h2>Dot Stretching Circuitry</h2>
		<p>To provide for this, the VT-terminals employ a special technique, called <em>dot stretching:</em> The individual rows of a character matrix as in ROM are modified on-the-fly by prolonging any pulses for an active pixel for yet another pixel. Where there’s a single pixel in ROM, there will be two on the screen, where there are two in a row, there will be three displayed. (This is equivalent to OR-ing a word with itself by an offset of one pixel or bit to the right.)</p>
		<p>By this, our 8×10 matrix extends to the expected 9×10 (or 10×10 for the 80-columns mode, where the last pixel, which is set only for the line-drawing characters, will be stretched for yet another pulse.)</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-dot-stretching.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 dot streching" width="830" height="376">
			<figcaption>Dot streching on the VT100 and VT200.<br><cite>(VT100 Series Technical Manual, EK-VT100-TM-002, p. 4-78)</cite></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>However, this will provide different results for normal character size and double-width characters! Thanks to the wonders of dot stretching, there are two distinct fonts in one, each of them specially suited for the display size by the amount of detail exhibited!</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/images/VTterm-dot-stretching-flanked.png" alt="VT100 and VT220 dot streching" width="410" height="410">
			<figcaption><p>1) as in ROM<br>
			2) single width with dot stretching<br>
			3) double width with dot stretching<br>
			4) single width with dot stretching and latency (flanks)<br>
			5) double width with dot stretching and latency (flanks)</p>
			<p><cite>(1, 2 &amp; 3 by Paul Flo Williams, <a href="https://vt100.net/dec/vt220/glyphs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vt100.net</a>, 4 &amp; 5 added by me, N.L.)</cite></p></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>It’s crucially the image given in (2), representing dot streching, which provides the blocky, rather bold strokes found in modern representation of the font. However, if we add the sine- and cosine-like ramps of the flanks of the rising and dropping phosphor activation (compare 4 &amp; 5 and the timing diagram above), we arrive at a closer rendition of the screen image (mind that the VT100 and VT220 are said to expose quite discernible scanlines).</p>

		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>As we may say, a rather extreme example of the media instructing typographical forms, or, <em>vice versa,</em> the glyph design working by the media and its specific technological constraints to arrive at the desired typography. Having a look at the effects of phosphor activation, latency and bleed, we may also understand, why individual photos of VT-terminal screens show varying font weights, according to the exposure in respect to the brightness of the monitor, while an overall smoothness of the font is still preserved.</p>
		
		<p>And here is another representation of the ROM-separations (compare the image above) with effects applied, providing a closer impression of the screen rendition:</p>

		<h2>Workbench Images</h2>

		<p>And here are, finally, two images <em>”from the workbench”,</em> showing my own attempts to recreate the screen experience in a web browser (HTML5, canvas API). Yea, there may be a bit too much retro-blur, however, you get the idea:</p>

						<p>Researchers at Harvard University have developed a new tool to help measure behaviors in animal movement.</p><p>The team ran their studies by combining their tool, CAPTURE, with neural recordings to describe the relationship between brain activity and behavior. They are also working with Google DeepMind to use CAPTURE to model animal behavior using deep neural networks.</p><p>"We had developed really elaborate approaches to study how the brain is disrupted in parkinsonian mice, but our ability to measure their behavioral deficits was a far cry from the nuanced ways we can assess the impact of Parkinson's on human behavior," said co-author Jesse D. Marshall. "It became clear to me that a major reason why so many drugs tested in mice don't translate to humans is that our ability to measure their effects on behavior is quite limited."</p><p>Marshall's obsession with the idea of CAPTURE started as a student working on Parkinson's Disease models in mice. Marshall was weary of the complexities and constraints involved with brain function in relation to the actions of an animal.</p><p>Animal behaviour is of significant interest to a wide range of fields, ranging from biology and psychology to ecology and pharmacology. Careful study of the behavior of laboratories helps researchers to simulate human disorders and to determine the efficacy of new drugs. A behavioral surveillance device blends motion capture with profound education to map the three-dimensional motions of free activities.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593937505566-64f33d148915?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGxhYiUyMG1vdXNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="A scientist works in the laboratory" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593937505566-64f33d148915?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGxhYiUyMG1vdXNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593937505566-64f33d148915?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGxhYiUyMG1vdXNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593937505566-64f33d148915?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGxhYiUyMG1vdXNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593937505566-64f33d148915?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGxhYiUyMG1vdXNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sdadsp?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Dmitriy Suponnikov</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>"In contrast to traditional motion capture in humans, which is done in short bursts, we collected data continuously, 24/7," said Marshall. "This allowed us to really quantify everything rats do in their normal lives -- an atlas for behavior."</p><p>Marshall spent six months working out how to repair markings for his creatures. He attempted tattoos, adhesives, and hair dyes before embarking on body-piercings. Team also studied how illness habits and medication responses shift.</p><p>Co-author Bence P. Ölveczky said, "Our lab studies how skilled movements are learned and generated by the brain. Traditionally, these studies are done by designing specific tasks and relating brain activity to simple behavioral readouts i.e. did the animal push this lever? Did the animal lick this port? Such observations tell us whether our rats solve the task, but says nothing about how they do it and that's exactly what we are interested in; how the brain learns and controls skilled movements. Getting at this required more precise and sophisticated readouts of behavior."</p><p>Scientists have long been suspecting that disturbed grooming may be used to model the motor stereotypes (repetitive movements and sons) The team is now conducting their research by integrating CAPTURE with neural recordings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A story about RFC 6238</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>DISCLAIMER:</em> I hate to keep mentioning it, but please don't abuse this knowledge. There are enough malicious actors out there already. This article was written to try and help our  defenders of the realm to be more effective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security models always seem to be great until they are not. The curious part is how many people seem to beg the question more often than not. It's easy to just blindly accept something as true without challenging it (such as the safety of a given model). As a community, we should support challenging perceptions and sharing knowledge with others.</p>

<p>At DefCon 26 I was drinking with some friends, discussing hashing and encryption, when the topic of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a> came up. This RFC defines an open standard for Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) to be used as a factor in authentication schemes. For the unfamiliar, it's pretty popular and widely supported. Many common multi-factor authentication mechanisms rely on implementing this spec (for example Google Authenticator, Duo Mobile, Authy, pyotp for python, and others.) But all of these services are only secure if the secret is confidential. Some people were convinced the TOTP implementations are flawed, and others were not. So can we break this security model by generating the same TOTP codes as a particular target?</p>

<p>After a bit of research and testing, I submitted attack mode <code>18100</code> to Hashcat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> I think the process for submitting any PR to the Hashcat project is fascinating. Mine have been worthwhile exercises in good coding practices and collaborative development. I would recommend others contribute to this project for the experience as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> I think the theories behind attacks are important, but if you don't care for the details just skip ahead to "Simulating an attack" in the next section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RFC itself is fairly straight forward. It builds on a previous RFC for OTP, but uses a timestamp to create a derived counter.</p>

<p>We start with our secret. It's just a base32 encoded value. This really could be anything, but it seems that most implementations have standardized on defaulting to encoding a random 10 byte value. (This leaves us with 16 bytes of encoded text.)</p>

<p>We then take the HMAC of our counter, using our encoded secret as the key. Let's call the product of this <em><code>H</code></em>.</p>

<p>An offset is next calculated from the end bits of <em><code>H</code></em>, and we extract four bytes of the hash from that offset and convert them to an unsigned integer. Using our integer, we take the modulo of 10^<em><code>length</code></em> (where <em><code>length</code></em> is the number of digits you want in your resulting code; up to 10), and we now have our TOTP code.</p>

<p>Now, if we can reliably determine which secret generates the OTP code in question at a particular point in time we will have a practical attack. This means that we need at least two pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A TOTP code</li>
<li>The rough timestamp at which this code was generated</li>
</ul>

<p>The caveat here is that the reduction on the HMAC hash results in a large number of collisions for a single point in time. Between two points in time, the collisions seem to be unique, but we should have a duplicate for the real secret which created our codes.</p>

<h2>Simulating an attack</h2>

<p>Let's now see if we can simulate an attack within a controlled keyspace. In order to keep our OpenCL kernels fast, the base32 encoding of our secret is only performed by the CPU once a candidate has been matched. This means that all of the candidates we try will be raw, but the output of a match will be base32 encoded.</p>

<p><strong>Don't try to attack the base32 value directly. This won't work!</strong></p>

<p>For this test, we will take our raw secret (<code>hashcat</code>) and base32 encode it to produce <code>NBQXG2DDMF2A====</code>. This represents our target secret which we hope to recover. In the wild, it would be sitting on some remote resource responsible for authentication, and unknown to us.</p>

<p>Next, we need two TOTP codes derived from this secret. It's a lot easier than it seems to obtain these codes. They do not need to be consecutive, we just need two of them. Something as simple as a photo (or video) of someone's TOTP client would be sufficient (a picture has the code which was produced, and the EXIF data should provide you with a timestamp.)</p>

<p>For this experiment, since this is just a test lab, we will use python's <code>pyotp</code> package to produce our two TOTP codes. We are going to use two random timestamps to generate these codes, using the <code>pyotp.TOTP.at()</code> method. (The timestamps can be any values, as long as they are different.)</p>

<pre><code>$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 17:41:52)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyotp
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp = pyotp.TOTP("NBQXG2DDMF2A====")
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp.at(1263384780)
u'833060'
&gt;&gt;&gt; totp.at(1528848780)
u'549115'
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have our tokens and our timestamps, we need to place them in a file using the format <code>$TOKEN:$TIMESTAMP</code>. Let's call the file <code>test.hash</code> for this simulation.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test.hash
833060:1263384780
549115:1528848780
</code></pre>

<p>The attack itself will be done in two parts:
* First, we run Hashcat against the test codes to produce all of the secret candidates in our keyspace. To keep this simulation manageable, we will only use the topology <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code>.
* Second, we will check our candidates for duplicates to find our genuine secret.</p>

<h3>The attack</h3>

<p>This particular hash mode is not like your average modes in Hashcat. By default its definition tells Hashcat to keep guessing candidates until the available keyspace is exhausted. As a result, Hashcat's "recovered" stat will always remain 0 despite your pot file filling up. This is expected, so don't worry!</p>

<p>Let's see an example in action...</p>

<pre><code>./hashcat -m17300 -a3 -o totp.potfile test.hash ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l
hashcat (v4.2.1-58-g1b980cf0+) starting...

</code></pre>

<h3>Post-hashcat cleanup</h3>

<p>Once the attack is finished, you should have a pool of candidates in your pot file. Most of them should be unique, but your genuine secret will be duplicated across two entries. We just need a tiny bit of shell work to reveal which one that was. The following snippet should do this for you.</p>

<pre><code>$ cut -d: -f3 totp.potfile | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
  2 NBQXG2DDMF2A====
  1 PJZXS23RPFYA====
  1 PJZXO5TDNZTA====
  1 PJZXM5DMOBTQ====
  1 PJZXM2LTMV2A====
  1 PJZXI5DWNZWA====
  1 PJZXG2DUNZTQ====
  1 PJZXA4LQOBUQ====
  1 PJZXA4LPN55A====
  1 PJZWYYTBONYA====
</code></pre>

<p>Huzzah! Our duplicated secret appears on top!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> If you see more than one entry with a count higher than 1, something went wrong. You should re-evaluate your steps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we can take this secret and plug it back into pyotp (or your client of choice) to generate valid tokens!</p>

<h2>Practical exploitation</h2>

<p>In the wild, this is a bit more nuanced. We aren't usually going to know much about the target secret (like its topology), so we may need to search through a larger keyspace. This could take quite some time. Of course, the more GPUs you have, the faster this will go.</p>

<p>This also assumes that your TOTP implementation is using a few defaults: 30 second steps, HMAC-SHA1 hashing, and 10-byte secrets. You may be surprised at how many implementations use the defaults, or worse yet make the defaults immutable (I'm looking at you Google Authenticator!)</p>

<p>For clarity, the RFC technically defines a secret length at 16 bytes minimum, but many implementations are calculating this from the base32 encoded secret. This means, our 16 byte secret is really a 10 byte secret when decoded. Again, it doesn't <em>have</em> to be this way. But even if the secret is 10 bytes, this attack may not be practical for most (though it isn't out of the realm of possibilities for some actors.) A truly random 10 byte keyspace is incredibly large (although "true randomness" deserves its own discussion.) Any insight you can gain to help reduce the keyspace is definitely going to help here.</p>

<p>If you are responsible for maintaining a TOTP system, I would recommend setting a stronger algorithm (use HMAC-SHA512 if possible) and longer secrets (24+ bytes should last a while into the future.)</p>

<p>Never take your world for granted. Test everything. Hack the planet.</p>

<![CDATA[How do C++ using-directives work?]]>

December 23, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/21/using-directive/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/21/using-directive/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Recall that in C++ there’s a difference between a <em>using-declaration</em>
and a <em>using-directive</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>using std::string;  // using-declaration
using namespace std;  // using-directive
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="using-declarations">Using-declarations</h2>

<p>A using-declaration is semantically similar to a declaration;
it introduces into the current scope a new meaning for a name. If that
name already had one or more meanings from outer scopes, those existing
meanings are <em>hidden</em>, or <em>shadowed</em>, by the new declaration.
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Khx1cb">Godbolt:</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace AnimalUtils {
    int foo(Zoo::Animal);
}
namespace Outer {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
    namespace Inner {
        int foo(Zoo::Cat);  // declaration hides Outer::foo
        int test1() {
            return foo(Zoo::Lion());
        }
        int test2() {
            using AnimalUtils::foo;  // using-declaration hides Inner::foo
            return foo(Zoo::Lion()); // calls AnimalUtils::foo
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The declaration of <code>foo</code> in <code>Inner</code> <em>hides</em>, or <em>shadows</em>, the previous meaning that <code>foo</code> had had;
so when we look up the name <code>foo</code> inside <code>test1</code>, we find only <code>Inner::foo</code>.
We don’t even consider <code>Outer::foo</code> as a candidate.</p>

<p>The using-declaration of <code>foo</code> in <code>test2</code> <em>hides</em>, or <em>shadows</em>, the previous meaning that <code>foo</code>
had had; so when we look up the name <code>foo</code> inside <code>test2</code>, we find only <code>AnimalUtils::foo</code>.
We don’t even consider <code>Inner::foo</code> as a candidate.</p>

<p>(So how does <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/07/11/the-std-swap-two-step/">the <code>std::swap</code> two-step</a> work?
Well, besides the normal unqualified lookup, we also do a <em>separate</em> argument-dependent lookup,
and merge the two candidate sets. So in this particular case, overload resolution would also
consider any meanings of <code>foo</code> declared in namespace <code>Zoo</code>. But there is no such <code>foo</code> in
this example.)</p>

<h2 id="using-directives">Using-directives</h2>

<p>Using-directives are subtler than using-declarations. But the good news is that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice">you should never use them!</a>
Seriously, don’t ever write <code>using namespace Whatever</code>; and then you won’t have
any trouble with them. Just pretend they don’t exist.</p>

<p><b>But</b>, let’s talk about them anyway.</p>

<p>Using-directives also introduce new meanings for names into scopes. But the surprising
thing is that they don’t introduce those meanings into the <em>current</em> scope! A using-directive
introduces its new meanings into the scope which is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor">lowest common ancestor</a>
of the current scope and the target namespace’s own scope.</p>

<p>In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the “lowest common ancestor” of two nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
can be found by tracing a path from <em>A</em> up to the root, and tracing a path from <em>B</em> up to
the root — the lowest common ancestor is the place where the two paths first meet up.</p>

<p>Alternatively, start tracing a “fully qualified path” downward from the root; the
lowest common ancestor corresponds to the longest common prefix of these fully qualified
names. For example, consider this hierarchy of namespaces:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace NA { }
namespace NB {
    namespace NC {
        namespace N1 { }
        namespace N2 { }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lowest common ancestor of <code>NB::NC::N1</code> and <code>NB::NC::N2</code> is <code>NB::NC</code>.
The lowest common ancestor of <code>NA</code> and <code>NB::NC::N2</code> is the root (the global namespace).</p>

<p>So, consider this snippet of C++ code (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/h41d9T">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace NA {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
}
namespace NB {
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
    namespace NC {
        namespace N1 {
            int foo(Zoo::Cat);
        }
        namespace N2 {
            int test() {
                using namespace N1;
                using namespace NA;
                return foo(Zoo::Lion());
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might reasonably expect that when <code>test</code> passes a <code>Lion</code> to <code>foo</code>,
it would result in a call to <code>NA::foo(Lion)</code>, because we “using-directive’d”
<code>namespace NA</code>. Or at least it might call <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>, since that’s
what would happen in the absence of any using-directives at all.
But in fact it calls <code>N1::foo(Cat)</code>!</p>

<p>As shown in the diagram below: <code>using namespace N1</code> causes a declaration of
<code>N1::foo(Cat)</code> to be injected into the least common ancestor of <code>N1</code> and <code>N2</code>,
which is <code>NC</code>. This declaration of the name <code>foo</code> <em>hides</em> any and all meanings
of <code>foo</code> introduced in higher-up scopes, such as <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>.</p>

<p><code>using namespace NA</code> causes a declaration of <code>NA::foo(Lion)</code> to be injected
into the least common ancestor of <code>NA</code> and <code>N2</code>, which is the global namespace.
This injected declaration ends up being hidden by the declaration of <code>NB::foo(Lion)</code>,
which is in turn hidden by the declaration of <code>N1::foo(Cat)</code> which has been
injected into namespace <code>NC</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/images/2020-12-21-using-directive.png" alt="Diagram of what happens in that example"></p>

<p>By the way, even though the declaration of <code>N1::foo</code> has been injected into <code>NC</code>,
you can’t actually refer to it as <code>NC::foo</code>. It has been injected only for the purposes
of <em>unqualified</em> lookups — and only for the purposes of unqualified lookups that happen
within this scope. Nobody outside of the scope of <code>test</code> is going to “see” that
declaration of <code>foo</code> injected into namespace <code>NC</code>.</p>

<h3 id="a-stdswap-mis-step">A <code>std::swap</code> mis-step</h3>

<p>Consider the following bad code (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6aPT71">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace detail {
    struct Impl {};
    void swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;);

    template&lt;class T&gt;
    void example(T&amp; x, T&amp; y) {
        using namespace std;
        swap(x, y);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s bad for three reasons. Number one, it fails to use the hidden friend idiom
for <code>swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;)</code>. Number two, it uses <code>using namespace std</code>. (Both of these are
red flags that should insta-fail any code review you do.)
Number three, its use of <code>using namespace</code> is wrong in terms of the “<code>std::swap</code> two-step.”
(See <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/07/11/the-std-swap-two-step/">“What is the <code>std::swap</code> two-step?”</a> (2020-07-11).)
In the two-step, we <em>want</em> to bring the meaning of <code>swap</code> from namespace <code>std</code> into our current scope,
so that <code>swap(x, y)</code> will consider that meaning in addition to any meaning assigned
by ADL. But what we’re doing here, instead, is to bring the meaning of <code>swap</code> (and every
other name in <code>std</code>) from namespace <code>std</code> into <em>the least common ancestor namespace</em> of
<code>std</code> and <code>detail</code>; i.e., into the global namespace.</p>

<p>So when we try to instantiate <code>example&lt;int&gt;</code>, unqualified lookup looks for declarations of
<code>swap</code> in our current scope working outward, and it finds <code>detail::swap(Impl&amp;, Impl&amp;)</code> and stops
there. It never finds the templated <code>std::swap</code> declared in the global namespace. Oops!
That’s why the <em>correct</em> version of the <code>std::swap</code> two-step uses a using-declaration and
not a using-directive.</p>

<h2 id="using-directives-in-namespace-scope">Using-directives in namespace scope</h2>

<p>You can also put a <em>using-directive</em> at namespace scope, like this
(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/9EdMMo">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>namespace ND::N3 {
    int foo(Zoo::Cat);
}

namespace NE {
    using namespace ND::N3;
    int foo(Zoo::Lion);
}

namespace ND {
    namespace N4 {
        int test3() {
            using namespace NE;
            return foo(Zoo::Lion());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using-directives are “transitive”; since <code>NE</code> visibly contains a using-directive
for <code>ND</code>, it’s as if <code>test3</code> contains <em>both</em> <code>using namespace NE</code> <em>and</em> <code>using namespace ND::N3</code>.</p>

<p>In this contrived example, the names from <code>NE</code> are injected into the least common ancestor
of <code>ND::N4</code> and <code>NE</code> (i.e., the global namespace). The names from <code>ND::N3</code> are injected into the
least common ancestor of <code>ND::N4</code> and <code>ND::N3</code> (i.e., <code>ND</code>). Then, unqualified
lookup for <code>foo</code> scans outward from <code>ND::N4::test3</code>, stopping as soon as it finds the declaration of
<code>ND::N3::foo(Cat)</code> that has been injected into namespace <code>ND</code>. That declaration <em>hides</em>
the ostensibly better-matching <code>NE::foo(Lion)</code> that was injected into the global namespace.</p>

<p>Note that the “transitivity” of using-directives applies only to using-directives that are <em>directly</em>
within the using’ed namespace. If <code>test3</code> had said <code>using namespace NE::N5</code>, it would have
transitively picked up the using-directives from <code>NE::N5</code>, but not from its parent namespace <code>NE</code>
(and not from the global namespace).</p>

<p>And how does all this interact with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace#Inline_namespaces"><code>inline namespace</code></a>?
Well, let’s save that for another day.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some of these examples probably surprised you. I hope the explanations made sense anyway, in retrospect.
But is any of this information <em>useful</em> to a good C++ programmer? I would have to say <b>no it is not.</b>
Good C++ programmers don’t use using-directives — and I hope this blog post has convinced you
to join them!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t use <code>using namespace</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for <em>why</em> using-directives work in this bizarrely unintuitive way, I’ve asked that
question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65365681/why-does-cs-using-namespace-work-the-way-it-does">over on Stack Overflow</a>.
So if you’ve got a good answer, that’s a great place to type it up!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>I have been talking with developers about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) recently and one question keeps coming up: “How do I revoke a JWT?”</p>

<p>If you poke around online, you’ll find that the most common answers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the duration of the JWT to a short period (a few minutes or seconds)</li>
  <li>Implement complicated blacklisting techniques</li>
  <li>Store every JWT so you can validate them</li>
</ul>

<p>There is not a simple solution because JWTs are designed to be portable, decoupled identities. Once you authenticate against an identity provider (IdP) and get back a JWT, you don’t need to ask the IdP if the JWT is valid. This is particularly powerful when you use RSA public/private key signing. The IdP signs the JWT using the private key and then any service that has the public key can verify the integrity of the JWT.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram that illustrates this architecture:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/jwt-revoke_350.png" alt="Revoking JWTs"></p>

<p>The Todo Backend in the diagram can use the JWT and the public key to verify the JWT and then pull the user’s id (in this case the subject) out of the JWT. The Todo Backend can then use the user’s id to perform operations on that user’s data. However, because the Todo Backend isn’t verifying the JWT with the IdP, it has no idea if an administrator has logged into the IdP and locked or deleted that user’s account.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-the-duration-of-the-jwt">Reduce the duration of the JWT</h2>

<p>The most common solution is to reduce the duration of the JWT and revoke the refresh token so that the user can’t generate a new JWT. With this setup, the JWT’s expiration duration is set to something short (5-10 minutes) and the refresh token is set to something long (2 weeks or 2 months). At any time, an administrator can revoke the refresh token which means that the user must re-authenticate to get a new JWT. That is unless they happen to have a valid JWT.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get tricky. That user basically has 5 to 10 minutes to use the JWT before it expires. Once it expires, they’ll use their current refresh token to try and get a new JWT. Since the refresh token has been revoked, this operation will fail and they’ll be forced to login again.</p>

<p>It’s this 5 to 10 minute window that freaks everyone out. So, how do we fix it?</p>

<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>

<p>One way is leveraging a distributed event system that notifies services when refresh tokens have been revoked. The IdP broadcasts an event when a refresh token is revoked and other backends/services listen for the event. When an event is received the backends/services update a local cache that maintains a set of users whose refresh tokens have been revoked. This cache is checked whenever a JWT is verified to determine if the JWT should be revoked or not. This is all based on the duration of JWTs and expiration instant of individual JWTs.</p>

<h3 id="example-revoking-jwts-in-fusionauth">Example: Revoking JWTs in FusionAuth</h3>

<p>To illustrate this, I’m going to use <a href="https://fusionauth.io/">FusionAuth</a>’s event and Webhook system as well as the <em>jwt.refresh-token.revoke</em> event. If you are building your own IdP or using another system, you might need to build out your own eventing system based on this article.</p>

<p>The FusionAuth <strong>jwt.refresh-token.revoke</strong> event looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"jwt.refresh-token.revoke"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"applicationTimeToLiveInSeconds"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"cc0567da-68a1-45f3-b15b-5a6228bb7146"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>600</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>"userId"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, let’s write a simple Webhook in our application that will receive this event and update the JWTManager. (NOTE: our example has a variable called <code>applicationId</code> that is a global variable that stores the id of the application itself - in this case it would be&nbsp;<strong>cc0567da-68a1-45f3-b15b-5a6228bb7146</strong>). Our code below is written in Node.js and uses the <a href="https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-node-client">FusionAuth Node client library</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Handle FusionAuth event. */</span>
<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/fusionauth-webhook</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revoke</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>applicationTimeToLiveInSeconds</span><span>[</span><span>applicationId</span><span>]);</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>sendStatus</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is how the JWTManager maintains the list of user ids whose JWTs should be revoked. Our implementation also starts a thread to clean up after itself so we don’t run out of memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>JWTManager</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>revokedJWTs</span><span>:</span> <span>{},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Checks if a JWT is valid. This assumes that the JWT contains a property named &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; that is a
   * NumericDate value defined in the JWT specification and a property named &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; that is the user id the
   * JWT belongs to.
   *
   * @param {object} jwt The JWT object.
   * @returns {boolean} True if the JWT is valid, false if it isn't.
   */</span>
  <span>isValid</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>=</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>sub</span><span>];</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>||</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>===</span> <span>null</span> <span>||</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>jwt</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>
  <span>},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Revokes all JWTs for the user with the given id using the duration (in seconds).
   *
   * @param {string} userId The user id (usually a UUID as a string).
   * @param {Number} durationSeconds The duration of all JWTs in seconds.
   */</span>
  <span>revoke</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>userId</span><span>,</span> <span>durationSeconds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>userId</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>durationSeconds</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>);</span>
  <span>},</span>

  <span>/**
   * Cleans up the cache to remove old user's that have expired.
   * @private
   */</span>
  <span>_cleanUp</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>(</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>item</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>,</span> <span>_array</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> <span>expiration</span> <span>=</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>item</span><span>];</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>expiration</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>now</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>delete</span> <span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>revokedJWTs</span><span>[</span><span>item</span><span>];</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>/**
 * Set an interval to clean-up the cache.
 */</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>_cleanUp</span><span>,</span> <span>7000</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our backend also needs to ensure that it checks JWTs with the JWTManager on each API call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/todo</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>next</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>jwt</span> <span>=</span> <span>_parseJWT</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>);</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>JWTManager</span><span>.</span><span>isValid</span><span>(</span><span>jwt</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>sendStatus</span><span>(</span><span>401</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And finally we configure our Webhook in FusionAuth:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/webhooks-2019.jpg" alt="Set up a webhook in FusionAuth"></p>

<p>We can now revoke a user’s refresh token and FusionAuth will broadcast the event to our Webhook. The Webhook then updates the JWTManager which will cause JWTs for that user to be revoked.</p>

<p>This solution works well even in large systems with numerous backends. It requires the use of&nbsp;refresh tokens and an API that allows refresh tokens to be revoked. The only caveat is to be sure that your JWTManager code cleans up after itself to avoid&nbsp;running out memory.</p>

<p>If you are using FusionAuth, you can use the Webhook and Event system to build this feature into your application quickly. We are also writing JWTManager implementations into each of our client libraries so you don’t have to write those yourself. At the time of this writing, the Java and Node clients both have a JWTManager you can use. The other languages might have a JWTManager implementation now but if they don’t, just submit a support ticket or a Github issue and we will write one for you.</p>

The emotional responses were varied (including happy tears) but always positive.”</p><p>More importantly, the improvements in verbal fluency – a key indicator of apathy – were marked.</p><p>The residents with higher levels of apathy recalled a lot more words immediately after the immersive sessions than beforehand, possibly activating specific regions of their brain.</p><p>“We believe that being in the immersive environment stimulates the brain areas involved in verbal fluency,” Saredakis says. “What we found was that people with high levels of apathy said more words after the experience, triggering something in their brain. It was an immediate effect and we don’t know how long it lasts.”</p><p>Some negative side effects of the virtual reality experience were reported, including dizziness and nausea – like motion sickness – and some eye strain. However, all participants endorsed the project and said it was their favourite activity in the home.</p><p>“The fact that residents with the highest levels of apathy showed the most improvements tells us that virtual reality could help improve the lives of older adults in residential aged care,” Saredakis says.</p><p>This research is currently being expanded to directly examine apathy and compare virtual reality to traditional forms of reminiscence therapy and a usual care group.</p><p><i>Notes:&nbsp;The 17 residents from Helping Hand came from a high socioeconomic background and most were well educated.</i></p><p><i>–</i></p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unisa.edu.au%2FMedia-Centre%2FReleases%2F2020%2Faged-care-residents-experience-a-different-kind-of-reality%2F&amp;t=M2MwOWYxOGRlYzhlYzlmODNmYzBhY2M1YTcwZjkzNTExYWMwOTg0OSxoaGtrMUxQVw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638328641529479168%2Fvr-improving-apathy-in-aged-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002152">University of South Australia</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Using Virtual Reality to Improve Apathy in Residential Aged Care: Mixed Methods Study”,&nbsp;<i>Journal of Medical Internet Research</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.2196%2F17632&amp;t=NDM4YzcxY2NlODM5YTRkMzY0NGViNjE5NmY0YjBkYjJlYTM0MmJiZCxoaGtrMUxQVw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638328641529479168%2Fvr-improving-apathy-in-aged-care&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002152">http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/17632</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/186224862472/ar-can-be-good-for-seniors-too">AR can be good for seniors too</a></p>

                    <p>Bug Bounty hunting is one of the most lucrative side hustles for the vast majority of hackers and security researchers out there. &nbsp;Security breaches like the SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack always remind us that it doesn't need much effort for attackers to find a weak point in systems and leverage that to gain persistence in networks – while it's not likely that's the way the attackers got in, but we had reported how <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-exposed-ftp-credentials-back-in-2018-says-security-researcher-vinoth/">SolarWinds had exposed a critical FTP credential through a GitHub commit since 2018</a>, only brought to their notice in late 2019. A brilliant way to prevent such breaches is to crowdsource talent, security is very hard to get right but when you have a thousand different eyes looking into it, it's very probable that they will find issues and edge cases you never thought in the development cycle of your applications – and that's where a Bug Bounty Program fills the gap.</p><p>A large number of WhiteHats now just rely on bug bounties as their only source of income, and it all begins to makes sense – when you see Hackers making millions through their art of hacking. Full time (independent) hacking is becoming a thing, as we have entered the age of bug bounties. Bug Bounties are no longer a disorganized sector, but with more platforms it has almost become a mainstream profession.</p><p>Almost a year back, <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> had announced that Cosmin (<a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a>) had reached $1 Million dollars in bug bounty earnings across their platform, and officially become the 7th Bug Bounty millionaire on the platform. Today, they tweeted that <a href="https://twitter.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a> has completed $2 Million dollars in bug bounty earnings which makes it an important landmark for the Bug Bounty industry, and the highest till date. Is it a vantage point or, will there be someone who will cross this?</p><h3 id="-1-million-dollars-in-bug-bounties-in-less-than-an-year">$1 Million Dollars in bug bounties in less than an year</h3><p><a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/congratulations-cosmin-worlds-seventh-million-dollar-bug-bounty-hacker">had earlier announced less than an year back</a> that Cosmin became the 7th hacker to have become a bug bounty millionaire. Now, he has crossed the $2M mark in all-time earnings, which means <a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">@inhibitor181</a> might have made $1M in bounties less than an year, on Hackerone itself.</p><h4 id="a-million-dollar-salary-with-just-about-4-years-of-work-experience">A Million dollar salary with just about 4 years of work experience</h4><p>At the age of 30, and with just 4 years of experience in bug bounty hunting, Cosmin makes $1 million in bug bounties a year from <a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">468<br>bugs that he reported on Hackerone</a>, and has made $2 million so far in bug bounties.</p><p>This is way higher than the pay of most senior position tech jobs or, cybersecurity/infosec jobs that we know. From Cosmin's <a href="https://hackerone.com/inhibitor181">Hackerone profile</a>, we came to know he joined the platform only around 4 years back in 2016 – with just about 4 years of experience (which is even less than what one can consider mid-level experience), a bug bounty hunter is able to earn $1M an year and make $2M in all time earnings. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">334 days ago we announced Cosmin as the 7th hacker to reach $1 million dollars in earnings.

This shows that the perception about whitehat hackers is gradually changing. Also, companies seem to prefer hiring people with hacking skills in security roles. In cybersecurity jobs, the focus of hiring is gradually shifting to people with advanced hacking skills than those with certificates and degrees.</p><h2 id="some-facts-about-hackerone">Some Facts about Hackerone</h2><p><a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> is one of the top Bug Bounty platforms. There are more bug bounty platforms like Bugcrowd, YesWeHack and so on, but Hackerone seems to have the largest market share and the only one where bug bounty hunters were able to make millions exclusively.	</p><p>Hackers from over <strong>170 countries</strong> have been hunting for bugs on Hackerone, Hackerone said in <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/resources/reporting/the-2020-hacker-report">their 2020 Hacker Report</a>.

<p>In his latest interview, engineer, analyst, and vehicle teardown wizard Sandy Munro discusses the future of the automotive industry and the role of Tesla in detail. Munro opened up about which companies he thinks can rival <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a> in the future and why most of them are still on the wrong path towards their ultimate doom. </p>



<p>I am going to jot down the major points he made on the show, you can directly jump to the video below by <a href="#video">clicking here</a>.</p>



<h2>Elon Musk lies a lot</h2>



<p>According to Sandy Munro, the CEO of one of the largest S&amp;P 500 companies, Mr. Elon Musk “lies a lot” — he is actually saying that Musk has developed a habit of understating and over-delivering. </p>



<p>Elon Musk does not fully disclose his next move, he just gives a hint and hides the most important stuff, just like the genius he is.</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/battery-day/">Tesla Battery Day</a> was hyped for a long time but no one exactly knew what the new <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/25/tesla-4680-cell-analyzed-sandy-munro/">4680 cells</a> looked like or even what the form factor or dimensions were, Chemistry is still a mystery. <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/#presentation">The presentation</a> showing a 56% cost reduction in batteries was also unprecedented.</p>



<p>Sandy Munro says the new Tesla 2170 battery cells have almost eliminated cobalt and added more nickel, that’s the reason Musk was looking for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel-idUSKCN24O0RV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nickel mines</a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Comparing Musk to the rest of the auto industry executives, he said the general public knows almost none of them, the only exception would be Volkswagen Chairman Herbert Diess. The reason behind this hiding is that they’re fearful of not being able to hit the bar which is set so high by <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>.</p>

<h2>QuantumScape, solid-state batteries, and Volkswagen</h2>



<p>Munro thinks if there would be any rival of Tesla’s 4680 lithium-ion battery in the next two years, it would be QuantumScape’s solid-state lithium-metal batteries. According to his knowledge, since Volkswagen has a big share in Bill Gates-backed QuantumScape, VW will be the only company rivaling Tesla in the EV marketplace in the near-term future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/sandy-munro/">Sandy Munro</a> is of the view that still it would take a lot of finessing to do with the solid-state batteries, “it will not be an easy trick,” he says.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Anybody who isn’t up to their necks into EVs is pretty much toast!</p><cite>Sandy Munro</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Auto Industry analysts are deprecated</h2>



<p>“I don’t take analysts seriously,” expresses Sandy Munro in his <a href="#video">interview video</a>. He even said that mainstream media is also skipping automotive analysts and taking the viewpoints of experts like him, it’s the new norm.</p>



<p>According to Sandy Munro’s analysis, 2021 is going to be a decisive year for the auto industry as <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/rivian/rivian-opens-configurator-package/">Rivian’s R1T Pickup Truck and R1S SUV</a> plus the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> deliveries will begin. It’s going to be hard on the traditional automotive companies.</p>



<h2>Rivian R1T vs. Hummer EV</h2>



<p>For his next teardown projects, Sandy Munro has already selected the Cybertruck but to meet the budget requirements, his company had to choose between the Rivian R1T and Hummer EV.</p>



<p>Munro &amp; Munro Associates ran a poll online and asked their 100k+ subscribers what they should do. According to Munro, 97% of the audience wanted to see the Rivian R1T teardown to its last screw. Rivian wins, Hummer EV loses — game over GMC.</p>



<h2>Giga Casting is the future of auto manufacturing</h2>



<p>For the past 10 years, Sandy Munro has been showing auto executives the giant underbody die casts sitting at his factory. “I think you’ve lost your mind,” this is the usual reply he got from them for all those years.</p>

        <section>
            <p>With the announcement of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">App Store Small Business Program</a>, I’ve stopped selling Unbound directly via the web site. I thought it would be worth explaining how I came to that decision.</p>
            <p>The original motivation for selling the app directly was simple: Apple took a 30% cut of sales, whereas <a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>, the payment processor &amp; authentication tool I was using to sell directly only took [<em>not-publicly-disclosed-but-substantially-less-than–30</em>]%. With the drop in Mac App Store fees, that gap has shrunk considerably… to the point that it’s no longer worth keeping Paddle around.</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareaworseexperienceforcustomers">1. Direct sales are a worse experience for customers.</h2>
            <p>From a customer’s perspective, every direct sale is its own little special snowflake, and you have to figure out how to get your license key, where in the app to enter it, etc. </p>
            <p>For the most tech-savvy users, this is pretty much a non-issue (until, of course, you migrate to a new computer and have to dig through your email to find your product key—good luck!). But a substantial percentage of users had trouble with this, and it was the #1 source of support requests for me.</p>
            <p>In contrast, virtually <em>every</em> Mac user is familiar with the Mac App Store. (And even if they aren’t, it can’t be a <em>worse</em> experience than trying to figure out a third-party platform!) Moving installs between machines is a non-issue, and there’s no such thing as an activation problem. </p>
            <h2 id="directsalesincreasetheoverheadofeachrelease">2. Direct sales increase the overhead of each release.</h2>
            <p>Unbound is not my day job, and revenue-wise, it probably doesn’t have any conceivable path to become my full-time income. (I’m measuring my income here in <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerAYoung/status/1341815721182056465" target="_blank">lattes per month</a>!) That means I can only work on it during nights &amp; weekends—a rather limited amount of time.</p>
            <p>For that reason, I want to maximize the time I actually spend shipping new features. Selling directly meant that I had to cut two builds, and go through two release processes, every time I wanted to ship an update. (And of course I’ve already mentioned the support burden of direct sales—support takes time directly away from development!)</p>
            <h2 id="directsalesareasecurityandprivacyliability">3. Direct sales are a security and privacy liability.</h2>
            <p>If Paddle suffered a data breach, suddenly <em>I</em> would be on the hook for exposing people’s emails or (God forbid) credit card data. While this has <em>not</em> happened, and I have no reason whatsoever to think Paddle is anything but competent, I’m still much happier trusting Apple’s security practices than <em>any</em> third party. (And if <em>Apple</em> has a security breach, I feel like I’m unlikely to take the blame from customers—the vast majority of them have done business with Apple directly in the past, whether for their computers, phones, or even just iTunes purchases.)</p>
            <p>Even apart from a data breach, removing all third parties from the equation is a privacy win for customers—I can proudly tell people the app collects <em>no</em> data whatsoever, whereas Paddle had to “phone home” to validate product keys.</p>
            <h2 id="itsjustnotworthitanymore">It’s just not worth it any more.</h2>
            <p>Given all that, the math just doesn’t work out in support of doing direct sales any more. Even if I moved sales to accepting credit cards directly, a 3.5% fee with all those downsides is substantially worse for both me and my customers than a flat 15%.</p>
            <p>Onward and upward!</p>

    <section>

<p>Tobi Lutke is the CEO of Shopify, which is a hugely successful E-Commerce company based out of Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<p>I find him interesting for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>He reasons from first principles about how to effectively build companies</li>
<li>He’s built a wildly successful technology company in a secondary market (i.e. not Silicon Valley)</li>
</ol>

<p>As someone that’s also trying to build a successful technology company in a secondary market (Ann Arbor), I’m definitely interested in what Lutke has to say.</p>

<p>One such piece of advice that he offers could be paraphrased as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When hiring in secondary markets, choose employees with the assumption that you’ll work together for at least 10 years.</p>

<p>That means that hiring based on the candidate’s growth potential is much more important than in primary markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This advice resonates with how I see people in Michigan view their jobs: generally, when they choose a job, they pick a job that they could see themselves working at for 5-10 years.</p>

<p>This contrasts sharply with Silicon Valley. If the average tenure at a company is two years, you can sure spend 5 hours each week mentoring Jill on how to better manage her team but gee whiz, by the time that actually starts to pay dividends she’s moved on to the company next door.</p>

<p>I do think that his “hire for growth” advice - while not <em>wrong</em>  - is at least insufficient to be useful. What does it mean to hire for growth? Does this mean not to hire senior engineers?</p>

<p>In this post, I’d like to carry forward Lutke’s first principles reasoning in order to determine how you should hire differently in secondary markets.</p>



<p>I like to think of what a candidate offers looks something like a layered cake: from bottom to top, the layers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foundational character traits</li>
<li>Foundational technical skills</li>
<li>Professional technical skills</li>
<li>Professional social skills</li>
</ul>

<p>The lower the layer in the cake, the harder it is to change that aspect of the person.</p>

<p>Starting with the bottom:</p>

<p><strong>Foundational character traits</strong> include how well someone can teach others, whether they can write well, whether they try to avoid the same mistake multiple times, and how eager they are to learn new things.</p>

<p>These traits take years to take shape and are often the direct result of someone’s upbringing and education. There’s a good chance that if you hire someone with a gap in one of these skills, you’re stuck with it.</p>

<p><strong>Foundational technical skills</strong> are the skills that someone needs before they can even really start grappling with the <em>real</em> skills that make them good at their job. For software engineers, you’re probably looking at someone that can program well in at least one or two languages, understands what a unit test is and how to write it, knows the basics of databases and networking, etc.</p>

<p>These skills are <em>certainly</em> teachable (as demonstrated by many-a CS curriculum). However, they’re wide-spanning enough that it likely takes years to learn them in a comprehensive way that ensures good coverage.</p>

<p>For example, when working on a project, it’s hard to justify stopping in the middle to take a few weeks and go learn SQL. If you make a hire without foundational technical skills, you’ll find that you’re often faced with two choices when you encounter one of these gaps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Halt whatever you’re working on and develop a plan to fill that knowledge gap</li>
<li>Do “just enough to get by” but never really fill the knowledge gap</li>
</ol>

<p>The first makes it hard to put this person on any sort of time sensitive project, while the latter never really addresses the problem.</p>

<p>That’s why I think that foundational technical skills are a must-have, even when hiring for junior positions.</p>

<p><strong>Professional technical skills</strong></p>

<p>These are the skills that get “layered on top of” the foundational technical skills in order to really make someone effective at their job.</p>

<p>For software engineers, I consider these skills the ones that basically no CS undergraduate will have learned in school. These are things like how to effectively monitor code running in production, design an API, or scale a service as it gets more usage.</p>

<p>These skills are often learned through a combination of actually facing the problem and having someone else around that’s faced it before and can help you learn how to solve it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the problems themselves are often ones that are hard to replicate in the classroom. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The solutions to these problems cost significant money (how to implement monitoring and APM services)</li>
<li>The problems only exist due to the volume of traffic that a service is receiving (how to effectively use a load balancer)</li>
<li>The problems only exist due to many engineers collaborating on a project (how to ensure consistent code styles and distribute knowledge of best practices)</li>
</ul>

<p>Junior engineers cannot be expected to have these skills.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because these skills are a result of facing the problem before and not all engineers specialize in all things, not all <em>senior</em> engineers should be expected to have these skills. However, senior engineers should be expected to have depth in <em>a few</em> of these areas and - if you’re hiring well - at least one of those areas hopefully addresses a pain point that your team currently has.</p>

<p>Hiring this way allows senior engineers to be the mentor necessary to effectively bring junior engineers and other senior engineers “up to their level” in their respective area of expertise.</p>

<p><strong>Professional social skills</strong></p>

<p>These skills are layered on top of even the professional technical skills and are the ones that allow someone to coordinate a group of people to work together and grow as a team.</p>

<p>I don’t have much insight to offer here: I’m still learning.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In secondary markets, hire for growth potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d like to offer a corollary to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In secondary markets, hire people who are both great teachers and avid learners.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Being an effective teacher requires a high level of empathy with the audience along with communication skills that are very, very hard to teach. That’s why I stuck it in the “foundational character traits” bucket above. It’s very likely that if you hire a bad teacher, they’ll remain a bad teacher.</p>

<p>The problem with this becomes apparent when you see what happens when you hire a bad teacher at each level:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you hire a senior engineer that’s a bad teacher, they’re unable to mentor the rest of the team in their domains of expertise. This means that you get minimal leverage on their skillset</li>
<li>If you hire a junior engineer that’s a bad teacher, you’re investing years of training into someone from whom you’ll ultimately get minimal leverage from their skillset</li>
</ul>

<p>In computer science terms, hiring good teachers yields superlinear returns because you benefit from both the work they do and the increased level of productivity they help others reach.</p>

<p>Hiring bad teachers yields a linear return because you benefit only from the work they do.</p>



<p>Along with teaching, there’s one other foundational trait that’s critical when hiring in secondary markets: the person has to be an avid and effective learner. A strong growth mindset is critical.</p>

<p>If you think of someone’s growth as a straight line, their attitude towards learning and their ability to effectively learn greatly influence the slope of that line. Finding effective learners is much more important when the time that the person will be spending with you is significant. In high-turnover primary markets, the skill change during the minimal time the employee spends with you is likely to be small regardless of their ability to learn, so you should hire them primarily based on their current abilities. This isn’t true when hiring in secondary markets.</p>



<ul>
<li>Carefully choose what foundational character traits you care about and figure out how to identify them in interviews.</li>
<li>In secondary markets, seek out great teachers and avid learners</li>
<li>Choose your foundational technical skills and figure out how to identify them in interviews.</li>
<li>Senior engineers should have depth in multiple areas, at least one of which will broaden the team’s overall expertise.</li>

<p>“A street guy like T is a different kind of person. Everything for a guy like that, for, a member, is different. They’re in that private world of their own and that’s all they want to know. They’re in it all their lives. They’ve got fathers and uncles and cousins inside. They’re many inside and, believe me, they love it. They’re like gypsies, all by themselves with their secrets. They love to sit around and make deals with each other. Make their moves. When you and I are in bed, they’re making their moves.</p>
<p>“You should see them go through the papers in the morning, sucking their fingers and turning the page, sucking their fingers and turning the page, and then, when they get to something they like, they say, ‘Questo ca e una Cosa nostra,’ and that means, ‘This is something for us,’ you know what I mean? Believe me, when they go to church, because most of them are so religious they got saints hanging all over the walls of their houses, when they go to church they pray to God, ‘O Jesus, Mary and Joseph, give me the strength to rob again.’</p>
<p>“Even when they get arrested, and for them that’s no disgrace, they’re making their deals. They sit with each other in the cafes and with their lawyers. ‘Can we reach this guy?’ ‘Can we do it this way?’ ‘If we take a plea, can we make a bargain?’ That’s what they love. Always dealing. With the cops, the D.A., everybody. It’s like playing pinochle with prison sentences.</p>
<p>“I remember near the end of the war when T got drafted. In six months he was back on the street with a psycho discharge and 100 per cent disability from the Government. He was no more crazy than I am, but he kept yelling and banging his head on the floor and eating newspapers until they gave up. See what I mean? Always scheming. Not enough to be back on the street, he comes out with $350 a month clear for the rest of his life. I remember when he got out we had some birthday party for him. It was one of the only times I remember that he laughed, but he was still pretty young.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Frank Mari, alias Frankie T, alias Frank Russo, alias T, kissed his wife goodbye the morning of Sept. 18, shoved his forearm into the playful jaws of his white German shepherd, handed a small overnight bag to his bodyguard and drove away from his Searington, L.I., home for what many of his Mafia contemporaries feel was the last time. Within two weeks a story appeared on page 30 of <em>The New York Times</em> that read, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frank Mari, a gunman who survived three years of the Mafia’s “Banana War,” vanished more than two weeks ago and is now believed by Nassau County police to have been murdered, along with Michael Adamo.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is puzzling the police is whether the double killing—if that is what happened—marks renewal of the underworld war by friends of the exiled Joseph (Joe Bananas) Bonanno, or was the work of some of Mari’s associates jealous of his rapid rise as an underboss to Paul Sciacca, Bonanno’s successor ….</p>
<p>“Until we find the bodies, either dead or alive, we’re not sure of anything,” said a high New York police official. “It could be murder, and it could be that these two fellows had a reason for disappearing.”</p>
<p>Marl’s wife, Jane, and Adamo’s wife, Grace, did not report their husbands’ disappearance to the police immediately.</p>
<p>At 43 years Frank Mari was not one of the city’s most prominent mafiosi. He rarely found his name in the newspaper, and when he did it usually appeared midway down a list of multisyllabic surnames, most of which were either misspelled or followed by phony addresses. Frank Mari had never been arrested at any of the prestigious Apalachin‐style meetings, had never testified before a Congressional committee or had to duck the television crews and newsmen who waited outside police stations and legislative hearings. Joseph Valachi’s naming him a “soldier” in the Mafia family of Joseph Bonanno attracted no public attention and very little interest among the most ambitious prosecutors. Even his criminal record, which dates back to 1945 and includes eight arrests for a variety of charges from felonious assault to conspiracy to violate Federal narcotics laws, has only one conviction. In May of 1968 Frank Mari began to serve a three‐month jail term for illegal possession of a gun.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frank Mari was just one of 4,500 Federally certified Cosa Nostra members, and his life, like the lives of the majority of those pathologically defensive men, was inbred and insular. Mari’s father‐in‐law is a captain in the Bonanno family; his brother‐in‐Iaw is a soldier in the Genovese family, and 17 months before his disappearance he was credited with encouraging the marriage of his niece to the son of Paul Sciacca, then the boss of the entire Bonanno family. Like most mafiosi, Mari did not associate with anyone who was not either a member or related to a member of that exotic sub culture. Outsiders—all outsiders—are considered prey who can be lied to, cheated, frightened, robbed and murdered.</p>
<p>Around strangers Mari was silent, remote, and expressionless. His life was as narrowly prescribed as that of a Supreme Court justice. Reclusive, quiet and even dull, Mari lived with his wife and two daughters in middle‐class suburban community where he was considered a polite, if remote, neighbor. Mari’s son, a 21-year‐old law student, was away at school most of the time. Mari’s hobbies were limited to training his dog and collecting rare coins. His neighbors, who had heard of Mari’s Mafia connections, either refused to believe it or said it made no difference since he was more desirable than some of their other neighbors. Even a New York City patrolman who lived nearby said there was very little about Marl’s home life to criticize.</p>
<p>“He was always a gentleman,” the patrolman said. “Only time I ever saw him was when he was playing with his kids or when he was in the backyard on Saturday morning teaching his dog to be vicious.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Away from his home, Mari’s life appeared just as uneventful. During the day he always ate before or after the lunch and dinner hours to avoid being seated next to strangers, and he never ate in a restaurant where he did not know personally the owners and waiters. Despite the fact that both police and Mafia informers swear that Mari could be a cruel, ruthless killer, equally adept with gun, garrote or knife, he never acted precipitantly. Like millions of other Americans he was treated rudely by retail clerks; restaurants and bars sometimes padded his bills, and he had to wait in line to see first‐run films with his wife on Saturday night.</p>
<p>On occasion he did exercise his power as a member of the Honored Society in personal matters, but not often. Once a very close friend asked him to see what could be done about a narcotics pusher who was selling drugs around a Bronx school. The police, Mari’s friend said, could or would do nothing. Selling narcotics to strangers is business to the mafiosi, except when it threatens their homes. Therefore, when Mari had determined that the pusher was not connected with any Mafia family, or “mobbed up,” he ordered two goons sent to the school, where they mercilessly beat the man. The man fled the neighborhood and never returned.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Mari found out that a rare coin, worth $1,500, which he had intended to buy for his $19,000 collection, had been stolen from a coin dealer. According to several of his friends, Mari was agitated enough by the theft to dispatch some of his men to question fences all around the city. When they discovered who had done the job, Mari had the burglar’s Brooklyn house staked out as though the burglar were being set up for a hit. When the man got home and was confronted by four, tight‐lipped gunmen in two cars, he screamed that they couldn’t possibly want him, that there had to be some mistake. He was even more bewildered when his abductors took him before a Mafia coin collector who gave him $500 for the coin and sent him back to Brooklyn in chauffeured car with two bodyguards.</p>
<p>On still another occasion a local priest asked Mari if he could help the Christmas collection for the children of the poor. A few days later a truckload of toys was delivered to the church along with several racks of new children’s clothing and a cash gift of $2,000. Mari’s only stipulation was that he be acknowledged as the donor.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a Mafia soldier, Frank Mari knew that his telephone was tapped, his house was bugged and that three or four days every month he was the subject of a routine 24‐hour surveillance by either local or Federal agents. These, as well as thousands of other inconveniences, had long ago been incorporated into his life, just as they have become a part of the lives of other mafiosi. He knew that telephones were to be used sparingly and for only the briefest and most cryptic messages. Conversations about the brotherhood or indictable crimes were invariably held out of doors, usually while walking through crowded city streets with bodyguard or “shooter” near by. During such walks Mari employed the old jailhouse technique of using a news paper, handkerchief or even his hand to cover his mouth in an attempt to thwart lip readers.</p>
<p>Mari avoided telephones to such an extent that he would not use even the public phones in the immediate vicinity of his house. Mafiosi insist that the F.B.I. deliberately breaks most of the pay telephones in the vicinity of their homes, then taps the few that are left working. On the days when Mari was under surveillance he followed a common Mafia police practice, worked out for their mutual convenience, whereby his daily itinerary was shown to the lawmen so that if they became accidentally separated in traffic during the day, the police tail could always pick him up at the next stop. On such days, of course, most of Mari’s illegal activities were taken care of by his associates or relatives.</p>
<hr>
<p>Until his disappearance, Frank Mari ruled a million dollar Mafia conglomerate from a chair outside a dingy, storefront social club on Manhattan’s …</p></div></div>

        <p>swisstopo already provides numerous online tools and geodata free of charge. These can be obtained directly from swisstopo or via the opendata.swiss platform.<br>
</p>
<p>In future, all swisstopo's standard digital products, such as digital maps, aerial photographs and landscape models, will be available free of charge as Open Government Data and will be freely usable. These will be made available in such a way that users can acquire them independently from the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p>The Federal Council took a first step on 3 April 2020 with the amendment of the Geoinformation Ordinance. This forms the legal basis for the free distribution of all swisstopo's standard digital products as Open Government Data. The associated annual revenue shortfall of CHF 4 to 5 million was approved by Parliament in the budget debate of December 2020. From 1 March 2021, swisstopo digital standard products will therefore be available online free of charge.<br>

        <p>Free means without costs or fees for the standard digital products. These can be downloaded free of charge from the Internet by users without additional processing.</p>
<p>For geodata:<br>
Free of charge means that no fee is charged for the use of the data. It is also free if the user downloads the data from the Internet him or herself. However, if the data must be prepared and sent by a swisstopo employee, a fee is charged for the preparation of the data. From 1 March 2021 onwards, not all swisstopo geodata will be available for self-download. The number of datasets will be gradually expanded.</p>
<div><p>For geoservices:<br>
swisstopo geodata are integrated into the various geoservices of the Federal Geoinformation Infrastructure. These services can be used free of charge and without registration. For the use of service-based data via the geoservices, a maximum number of requests per time unit is set as a usage limit. Within this limit, the use of the data services is free of charge. The usage limit is to be observed as far as possible ("fair use").<br>
If the specified number of requests per time unit is repeatedly exceeded, swisstopo may conclude a contract with the data user for a higher number of requests. This use is then subject to a charge.</p></div>

        <p>There are three main reasons why the period until entry into force is so long:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amendment of the Geoinformation Ordinance will result in an estimated decline in swisstopo's financial income of CHF 4 to 5 million. This decline requires the approval of Parliament. The decision was made when the 2021 budget was approved in December 2020.</li>
<li>In order to be able to provide geodata free of charge subsequent to a positive decision by Parliament, swisstopo will need to adapt its IT systems. The adaptation will take a certain amount of time so that data can be obtained free of charge from 1 March 2021 at the earliest.</li>
<li>The early announcement of the free delivery of data also has the advantage that today's paying customers can adapt to the new situation and make the necessary preparations.</li>

<p>You might think that Mason jars are simply a staple of hipster home goods. But it turns out that demand for Mason jars — their lids, to be exact — are a remarkably accurate indicator of economic uncertainty. According to journalist Jen Doll who penned “<a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-everyones-suddenly-hoarding-mason-jars-4fe8cc1e098f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Everyone’s Suddenly Hoarding Mason Jars</a>“:</p>



<blockquote><p>The runs on Mason jars tend to occur when there is some kind of economic instability, recessions, in wartime, basically, anytime that people start to freak out about where they’re going to get their food, if they’re going to have enough food, what is happening in the world.”</p><cite>Interview on <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/12/07/why-demand-for-mason-jars-surges-in-times-of-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketplace</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Mason jar historians (yes, that’s a thing) have been able to correlate spikes in Mason jar sales to: the Great Depression &amp; World War II, the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s &amp; 80s, Y2K, the 2009 Recession and now 2020. Like squirrels hiding their nuts for the winter, people have jarred what they can in preparation for the end times, once again. </p>



<p>Doll’s story got us thinking about other products that thrive when apocalypse is in the air. Toilet paper, bottled water, canned goods, guns, gold… and that led us to wonder: </p>



<p><strong>Is Bitcoin a product of the doomsday industry?</strong></p>



<h2>Born out of chaos</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?resize=452%2C340&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="452" height="340" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-next-x-men-apocalypse-gone-rogue-113217.jpg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>For starters, Bitcoin was born right after the markets collapsed in 2008. The creator of Bitcoin even <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block">referenced a news article</a> about a second round of bailouts in the UK in the initial block of transactions recorded to the Bitcoin blockchain. Some viewed Bitcoin as both a solution to and a rebuke of the current financial system.</p>



<p>Now, we aren’t here to debate if the central banks did the right thing. But the bailouts rubbed many people the wrong way. You had powerful government officials helping the financial elite, i.e. their buddies at the country club. A lot of Wall Street typically lobbies against social programs that help lower income groups, yet here they were accepting handouts from the government. And there was the “moral hazard” of not allowing the invisible hand of the markets to do its work — penalize risky lenders and borrowers — and allow these actors to self-correct rather than be saved. </p>



<p>The financial crisis also brought to light aspects of the modern financial system that disturbed many people. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Too Big to Fail – The financial system hinging on a select group of massive banks. Many believe you couldn’t let the banks fail even if they deserved to, otherwise everyone would get screwed.</li><li>Fractional Reserve &amp; Interbank Lending – Banks lending out far more money than they had in reserves (fractional reserves) and lending to each other (interbank lending). Banks are so interconnected that if one can’t make good on returning money to its lenders, all banks can be in trouble. </li><li>Modern Monetary Theory – Government central banks “printing money” to keep the retail banks afloat. They did this by buying the bad debt from the retail banks at way-above-market-prices. This allowed retail banks to put cash in their reserves and stay afloat.</li></ul>



<p>(<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/macroeconomics-income-inequality/the-2008-financial-crisis/v/bailout-1-liquidity-vs-solvency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kahn Academy</a> does an awesome job of breaking down the 2008 financial crisis if you want an easy-to-understand, in-depth look).</p>



<p>In the context of that time period, Bitcoin had a lot of appeal:</p>



<ul><li>No need for intermediaries, i.e. banks. Bitcoin allows you to transact with and store your coins on your own.</li><li>More fairness. Because Bitcoin is code, it doesn’t have any human biases deciding who gets a bailout and who doesn’t. In fact, there is no mechanism for bailouts. Everyone needs to be self-sufficient.</li><li>No single point of failure. Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol. No single party (or select few) can bring it all to a halt if they screw up.</li><li>What you see is what you get. The blockchain lets you see the coins you have access to. It’s not a representation of what you are owed, which is what you see when you log into your online account at Chase or Bank of America. It’s actually there.</li><li>No arbitrary money printing. Hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol is a limit on the total supply of Bitcoin. There will never be more than 21 million coins unless 51% of all miners vote otherwise, and that is highly unlikely.</li></ul>



<p>In other words, Bitcoin was born out of chaos.</p>



<h2>2020</h2>

<p>Fast-forward to 2020 — global pandemic, massive unemployment, political polarization, violent protests, <em>etcetera</em>.</p>



<p>And the price of Bitcoin just cracked its all-time high.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="665" height="388" src="https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=665%2C388&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C598&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=768%2C449&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?resize=660%2C385&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-3.png?w=1303&amp;ssl=1 1303w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>Back in the early years of Bitcoin, there was a narrative that Bitcoin was digital money. But that’s lost momentum for a variety of reasons: its price has been too volatile, government regulation, transaction fees have been too high which makes smaller transactions impractical, consumer user experience has been lacking, etc. </p>



<p>Since then, the narrative has evolved to focus on Bitcoin’s abilities as a store of value. Like gold, <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/why-bitcoin-is-called-digital-gold-and-why-store-of-value-is-a-bullshit-argument/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation</a>. </p>



<p>During these “unprecedented times” of 2020, Bitcoin proponents point to record low interest rates and the massive money printing done by governments to stimulate/ prop up economies. They tout that Bitcoin will become THE way to preserve wealth. And people are buying it (both the story being told and Bitcoin itself).</p>



<p>In this narrative, it feels like Bitcoin’s ultimate success — to be the end-all-be-all store of value — depends on the complete and utter failure of our current monetary system. Ya know, doomsday.</p>



<h2>Trust issues</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="531" height="403" src="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?resize=531%2C403&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i1.wp.com/prudentlycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/344082-Two-Reasons-I-Don-t-Trust-People.jpg?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Why people hoard Mason jars during times of economic uncertainty is not clear. Sure, some people are doing it to cut costs. But in interviewing historians, Doll found that people may be subconsciously motivated by a desire for control:</p>



<blockquote><p>When there are these big downfalls of trust in systems of government or economy or institutions, there’s this desire to retain control wherever we can find it… Growing your own garden or canning your own food offers a sense of transparency, even if it’s an illusion. You don’t just have to trust in the system.&nbsp; </p><cite>Anna Zeide, PhD, author of&nbsp;<em>Canned: The Rise and Fall of Consumer Confidence in the American Food Industry</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Hmmmm, is it just us, or could Zeide talking about crypto? </p>



<p>If you’ve read about crypto or listened to podcasts, you’ll know that “trust”, “trustless” and “trustlessness” are basically crypto bingo words. There are even diehards in the crypto community who say “not your keys, not your coins” because they don’t trust custodial services to manage their cryptocurrency. They want sole control, even though <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-wallet-vs-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-custodying can be just as risky</a>, if not more.</p>



<p>Let’s modify what Zeide said: “When there are these big downfalls of trust in systems of government or economy or institutions, there’s this desire to retain control wherever we can find it… <strong>Keeping your money in crypto</strong> offers a sense of transparency, even if it’s an illusion. You don’t just have to trust in the system.”</p>



<p>It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that the psychology behind hoarding Mason jars feels strangely familiar to buying up Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>The Pinterest-Etsy-DIY-farm-chic-urban-boho-avocado-toast market</h2>



<p>As you may know, Mason jars experienced a renaissance in the 2010’s when it captured the mindshare of the Pinterest-Etsy-DIY-farm-chic-urban-boho-avocado-toast market (or PEDYFCUBAT, for short). 200+ years after its invention, Mason jars became in vogue independent of any major global crisis. Huzzah!</p>



<p>Bitcoin could find it’s version of the PEDYFCUBAT market, too (though ideally faster than a couple hundred years). Personally speaking, we think Bitcoin hasn’t reached market saturation yet. And its price will eventually end up coming to a kind of steady-state, which it will then fluctuate around. (This is <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/is-cryptocurrency-a-good-investment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why we bet on Bitcoin</a>, in spite of all the hype).</p>



<h2>End of the beginning</h2>



<p>This week, the coronavirus vaccine is rolling out to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, and the FDA continues to authorize more vaccines. While we’re not out of the woods economically speaking, this may be the beginning of the end. One cannot help but wonder: if the economy recovers and we’re “back to normal”, will Bitcoin’s bright star fade as well?</p>



<p>Until the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it arrives, perhaps Bitcoin is not on an exponential trajectory upwards. Bitcoin demand might be more like the Mason jar’s — growing slowly, jumping and falling sharply along the way, in sync with seasons of economic instability.</p>

<p>When building an app, it's often a requirement to make sure your users are real and you want to know if they own the email or phone number that they signed up with so you can communicate via those channels.</p><p>In this tutorial, we'll build a flutter app that allows users to <strong>sign up and sign in with their email or phone number</strong>.</p><h3 id="in-this-post-">In this post:</h3><ul><li><a href="#create-a-flutter-app">Create a Flutter App</a></li><li><a href="#sign-in-with-email">Sign in with Email</a></li><li><a href="#sign-in-with-phone-number">Sign in with Phone Number via SMS or WhatsApp</a></li><li><a href="#that-s-it">See the result: Sign in with Phone Number</a></li></ul><p>If this is your first time making a Flutter app, check out their <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install">installation guide.</a> To create a new flutter app, run:<br></p><pre><code>flutter create flutter_passwordless

                <p>hyper v0.14
I’m so thrilled to announce the release of <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Fhyper%2Freleases%2Ftag%2Fv0.14.0&amp;t=M2Y1MjVmMDFiMWMwZmZmMjAyMDUxZjkxMDU0MDU1ZmEyMTAzYzk4NSxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">hyper v0.14</a> today. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fhyper.rs&amp;t=ZmQwMDYzMGZmYWI1Y2VjN2EwNjVmYzEwYTg3NzA0NzY4YTg3YTUzNCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">hyper</a> is a safe, reliable, fast HTTP library written in Rust. It provides asynchronous client and server APIs, supporting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.</p><h3>What’s this release all about?</h3><h4>Tokio 1.0</h4><p>Today also sees the release of <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftokio.rs%2Fblog%2F2020-12-tokio-1-0&amp;t=OTgxMTUzYTMwZGIzMDMyYjM5MzNjODAxYzE5MTY5MmFkYTdmNWQxNyxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">Tokio v1.0</a>. We wanted to ensure that with that momentous release, hyper was ready immediately so the ecosystem can start using it right away. This change doesn’t have much of an outward effect on hyper’s API, but is a big step towards stabilizing the Rust networking experience.</p><h4>Optional Main Features</h4><p>hyper has had optional features for a while, such as optional support for the Tokio. This allows convenient usage with the excellent Tokio runtime, while allowing others who have an existing runtime to just use hyper for its HTTP bits.</p><p>In this release, however, we’ve made the main pieces of hyper optional features.</p><ul><li><code>http1</code></li><li><code>http2</code></li><li><code>client</code></li><li><code>server</code></li></ul><p>These features cover the largest parts of hyper, its protocol implementations. With these now able to be enabled or disabled, you can significantly reduce the amount of code you compile and include in hyper. For example, if you’re application always talks to an HTTP/1 server, you can enable just the <code>http1</code> and <code>client</code> features. Or <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Ftonic&amp;t=OGI5NzViODRlNzMyNTAwZGUyNDI5MDUwN2I4NWExMGU1NDFhNmQ3YyxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">Tonic</a>, a Rust gRPC library, since it is based on HTTP/2, it can disable the HTTP/1 code in hyper, enabling only <code>http2</code>, <code>client</code>, and <code>server</code>.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p>This release is timed to go out with <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftokio.rs%2Fblog%2F2020-12-tokio-1-0&amp;t=OTgxMTUzYTMwZGIzMDMyYjM5MzNjODAxYzE5MTY5MmFkYTdmNWQxNyxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">Tokio v1.0</a>, and notably isn’t hyper 1.0 yet. That means we’re not done. Here’s what we have planned coming soon:</p><h4>Stability</h4><p>We have our eyes set on making hyper stable, with a 1.0 release. We know many people rely on hyper to make fast, reliable HTTP applications and libraries, and it’s a top priority to make hyper stable and no longer need breaking changes.</p><p>Stability is also meant in terms of reliability: we’ll continue to fix bugs, improve performance, and undertake internal refactors that shouldn’t affect the API, but will result in more and more reliable HTTP for users.</p><h4>Simplification</h4><p>As part of the drive to stabilization and 1.0, we will be making strides towards simplifying the public API exposed in hyper. Simplifying things can mean different things, so for hyper, it refers to removing the more opinionated pieces. That means aiming to embrace the “low level” aspect of hyper, and moving more “high level” pieces into other libraries.</p><h4>C API</h4><p>Stabilizing and simplifying doesn’t mean nothing new is coming. New things are being worked on <em>right now</em>, but with great care to not disrupt the stabilization efforts.</p><p>hyper is a <em>safe</em>, correct, fast HTTP implementation written in Rust, and as it matures, the desire to use that safety in places that <em>aren’t</em> Rust grows. We’ve been working on a <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhyperium%2Fhyper%2Fpull%2F2278&amp;t=MmQ0NTNlMDA3ZWNjMTJjMTYxYWEzYWY4N2JlOGNhZWZhNTVlZDNhMCxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">C API</a> for hyper, with the first main user being the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdaniel.haxx.se%2Fblog%2F2020%2F10%2F09%2Frust-in-curl-with-hyper%2F&amp;t=ZmQ0ZjliOGZiZjI3NDg2ZGQxODBjYTQyMmRjY2U5OTYyNmZmNjM1YSxVbDhCczJ6Vw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AN6mvDp1g04CUwpyFLi522Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fseanmonstar.com%2Fpost%2F638320652536922112%2Fhyper-v014&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002154">curl</a> project.

<p>Back in 2017, I started doing something I called Epistemic Spot Checks, in which I would read the first few chapters of a book and investigate their claims (factual or logical), to see how much they could be trusted. I now think this was a <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2020/06/09/where-to-start-research/">suboptimal</a> way to do things, but it’s how the ball got rolling. You can read these investigations in the <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemicspotcheck</a> tag.</p>



<p>This eventually grew into the Knowledge Bootstrapping Project, which has the goal of turning questions into answers without undo deference to credentialed authority (posts on this still fall under the epistemicspotcheck tag for historical reasons, or <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/metaESC/">metaESC</a> if they are about the process itself). This culminated in an algorithm for investigating questions as efficiently and thoroughly as possible, v0.1 of which can be found <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2020/07/06/knowledge-bootstrapping-steps-v0-1/">here</a>. Some external reviews of this process can be found <a href="http://morganredfield.com/blog/2020/07/on-knowledge-bootstrapping-v0-1/">here</a> (with <a href="http://morganredfield.com/blog/2020/08/knowledge-bootstrapping-experiment-2/">follow up</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/robot__dreams/status/1280667158763069442">here</a>. This work was originally supported by a grant from the <a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future">Long Term Future Fund</a>.</p>



<p>But it turned out that the key obstacle to learning for me was not an algorithm, it was <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2020/06/12/emotional-blocks-as-obstacles-to-learning/">emotional blocks</a> around the concept of learning and forming my own opinions, and resolving those is a process all its own. My current project is studying that process, although due to the nature of things that still involves a lot of object level research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My goal is to teach both the object level and the emotional process to others, and in doing so refine it to a more generalizable method.</p>

PiHole is open-source while AdGuard is a paid offering. I use one at home and the other one at the office. AdGuard is slightly easier to setup and use.

<p><em>23rd December 2020</em></p>
<p>A week tomorrow, on 31st December 2020, the Brexit transition period comes to an end.</p>
<p>This transition period has artificially kept in place most of the substance of membership of the European Union for the United Kingdom (other than representation on various institutions) even though as a matter of law the United Kingdom departed the European Union on 31st January 2020.</p>
<p>There is still no agreement in place for the future relationship.</p>
<p>There is still, it seems, not even an agreed draft text in final form.</p>
<p>And there certainly has not been ratification by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>(In the United Kingdom, parliament does not need to ratify an international agreement though parliament may need to legislate so as to implement what has been agreed.)</p>
<p>According to one well-connected and reliable commentator the current version of the agreement is two thousand pages long.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">19/ And, wait for it, one official raised the possibility that the text is now 2,000 pages long, including annexes</p>— Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE) <a href="https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1341482469929984002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>This is not a surprise, given the scope of what needs to be addressed in the agreement – the new ongoing relationship of the United Kingdom and the European Union on trade and other matters.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/20/uk-faces-brexit-limbo-after-talks-deadline-missed">news reports</a> that the negotiators have missed the deadline for any agreement to be voted on by the European Parliament before the end of the year.</p>
<p>But even if somehow the European Parliament can reconvene before end of the year, there is not enough time for anyone other than those directly connected with the negotiation (and so will be familiar with the text) to scrutinise the agreement.</p>
<p>Today is a Wednesday – Christmas Eve and Christmas Day block out tomorrow and Friday, and then it’s the the weekend, and then it is the Boxing Day holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>That leaves only three full days to do everything.</p>
<p>The situation is ludicrous.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A legal instrument is a complex thing.</p>
<p>Legal texts are not linear documents – you do not start reading on page one and go through to the end, and then stop.</p>
<p>A legal text is more akin to a computer program – law codes and computer coding are remarkably similar things.</p>
<p>Each provision – indeed, each word – in a legal instrument has a purpose.</p>
<p>Each provision has to, in turn, cohere with all the other provisions elsewhere in the text – so Article 45, for example, needs to fit with Article 54, and so on.</p>
<p>In an international agreement such as this relationship treaty, each provision also has to cohere with hundreds – perhaps thousands – of other provisions in other legal instruments.</p>
<p>(This is especially true of an agreement entered into by the European Union, which is a creature of law.)</p>
<p>Each provision also has to be capable of working in practice – and so needs to be assessed from a practical as well as a legal(istic) perspective.</p>
<p>And – perhaps most importantly – any significant legal instrument needs to be examined and approved by political representatives.</p>
<p>This last requirement is particularly important when the agreement will have huge consequences for people and for businesses.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And there is something else.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom government has now twice – in a rush – signed up to something so as to<em> ‘get Brexit done’</em> and then regretted it.</p>
<p>The first was the ‘<em>joint declaration’</em> in withdrawal agreement negotiations, and the second was the withdrawal agreement itself – which the United Kingdom government sought to legislate so that it could break the law.</p>
<p>This means that nobody can have any real confidence that government ministers have any proper understanding of what they are signing up to.</p>
<p>If any agreement needs proper scrutiny, this one does.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Charles Dickens in <em>A Christmas Carol</em> makes it so that all three visitations are packed into a single evening.</p>
<p>But not even an imagination as vivid as that of Dickens could make it plausible that a two thousand page agreement of such immense importance could be properly examined as a matter of law and for practicality, and to receive proper political scrutiny, in the few days available before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Brace, brace.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍<em>This guest post is brought to you by Zach Stein, co-founder of </em><a href="https://carboncollective.co/" target="_blank"><em>Carbon Collective</em></a><em>, a sustainable investing platform that provides low-fee, diversified portfolios built for solving climate change. </em></p><h3>‍</h3><figure id="w-node-37cd2f8a9b8b-61a1988f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6db441319a46c10ca23b4d/5fdc41c6d8b902fbbd589a03_Zach_updated_headshot.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Zach Stein, Carbon Collective</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>I've been working in the sustainable startup space since graduating college in 2011. I began humbly, helping found the Bay Area's largest worm composting farm. Yes, I literally sold shit for a living. I moved into aquaponics/hydroponics, raised ~$4m to build a novel sensing system to reduce waste in shrimp and fish farms, and since the beginning of 2020 have been fully focused on climate change. </blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>Sustainable investing:&nbsp;what is it, will it make you money, and how can you get started?</h3><p>‍</p><p><strong>Estimated reading time:&nbsp;</strong>4 minutes</p><p><strong>TL,DR:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>What is sustainable investing?&nbsp;</li><li>What is Carbon Collective and why was it founded?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there limitations of sustainable investing?&nbsp;</li><li>What are other tools and resources you can use to fight climate change?</li></ul></div><div><p><strong>What do you define as sustainable or ethical investing?</strong></p><p><strong>‍<br>‍</strong>We focus on sustainable investing because broad ethical investing is really hard. Why? We live in a deeply unequal, overly exploitative society. ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has been the financial world's best attempt at creating a way to invest ethically. And it's not great. Basically, analysts from different firms assign scores to publicly traded companies on these three categories. They then average them together to give each company a meta score. With these scores, they'll build a portfolio of companies above a certain threshold. The problem - these scores are totally subjective. The analysis firms don't agree with each other. And they combine all metrics together, meaning some really bad companies still make the cut, including many fossil fuel companies. So to us, ESG = less bad, but not good.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>We took a simpler, far more understandable approach, focusing on a single metric: carbon footprint. The carbon footprint data for publicly traded companies is quite strong. We love this free tool: <a href="https://fossilfreefunds.org/" target="_blank">https://fossilfreefunds.org/</a>. We use carbon footprint plus a few other tweaks to build portfolios that we believe are as sustainable as you can get while preserving diversity and low fees.</p><p>‍</p></div><p><strong>Many people see sustainability as a trade-off with wealth building. What do you say to that?</strong></p><p><strong>‍<br>‍</strong>The tradeoff is a myth at this point. From 2010 - 2019, <a href="https://blog.carboncollective.co/top-renewable-energy-stocks-beat-fossil-fuels/" target="_blank">renewable energy stocks have soundly outperformed fossil fuel stocks</a> in the US, UK, France, and Germany. Since the Covid-19 stock market crash back in March, 2020, the difference has been even more extreme. From 01/01/20 - 10/01/20, the energy sector returned: -49.45%. The clean energy sector: 82.60%. Historical returns are no guarantee of future ones, but a strategy divesting from fossil fuel and reinvesting in companies solving climate change would have performed well looking back over the past 5 years.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>The one place where it has been historically true has been fund fees. You generally have to pay more to invest in a mutual fund or ETF that has an ethical/sustainable goal. The fund managers have to put more work in and they want to get compensated for it. The #1 solar ETF, TAN, has an expense ratio of 0.71%. That's *really* high. </p></div><div><p>‍</p><p>We don't think you should have to pay more. Our portfolio largely use low-fee sector index funds. The average fund fees you'll pay is 0.09%, which is about the same as you would pay for a Betterment or Wealthfront account's generic portfolio. </p><p>‍</p></div><p>Our goal was to create a portfolio that tracked the market that was truly climate friendly. Looking backwards, we seem to have hit our goal. Looking forwards, it depends on your assumptions about which industries will grow and which decline. <br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6db441319a46c10ca23b4d/5fdc45aadf0c5e53f161e5c5_15.Slide2x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here's the results of a backtested simulation we did of our 80% stock, 20% bond Carbon Collective Portfolio vs. the overall stock &amp; bond market (represented by Vanguard index funds).</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Do you think that investing solely using Carbon Collective has any limitations?</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Not from a financial perspective. It's where we personally keep 100% of our investments. We built Carbon Collective because we could not find a way to invest that was climate-aligned but still felt safe for our full retirement accounts.</p><p>‍</p><p>If you are going to invest in the stock market, I can confidently say we have created far and away the best way we have seen to invest sustainably while still being a careful, smart investor.</p><p>‍</p><p>But that's a big "If." We live in an unequal, unjust world. For some investing in the stock market period feels like too much participation in that. It's a personal choice. We believe that your investment is needed to help push the companies building climate solutions forward. We also believe that right now, it's not a smart investment to invest <em>only</em> in those companies, which is why we invest more broadly in the low-carbon sectors of the economy, as well.</p><p>‍</p><p>Our portfolios will always be a work in progress. We update them annually to incorporate new data about companies and their carbon footprints. As more meet our inclusion threshold for the Climate Index, we'll include them and your money will get put to work supporting them.</p><p><strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Tell us more about why your platform is unique.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>I can say it better over video.</p><figure id="w-node-891ee874e6e4-61a1988f"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uQISXRqBoc"></iframe></p></figure><p>There are three options out there today for sustainable investing:</p><p>‍</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>ESG. Includes fossil fuel companies, very unclear how they make decisions on which companies to include/exclude. They're just less bad.<br>‍</li><li>Climate-focused funds. REDWX (from Aspiration), ETHO, CHGX. These don't include fossil fuel companies (although REDWX had Berkshire Hathaway), but they don't include companies with impact, building climate solutions. It's just less bad than ESG. Plus they're really expensive with fees all close to 0.50%.<br>‍</li><li>Green funds. TAN, ICLN, WIND. These are filled with awesome companies building our zero-carbon future but they lack diversity. You're not going to invest your whole IRA in just solar.</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>We use carbon footprint as our guiding metric. There are 11 sectors of the stock market. 85% of the CO2e from publicly traded companies comes from just four of them: energy, utilities, materials, and industrials. These sectors only represent 19% of the total value of the stock market. They are also the sectors that are actively dependent on fossil fuels for their core business. So we remove and replace them with the collection of over 112 companies building climate solutions. Then invest directly in the rest of the low-carbon parts of the stock market using low-fee sector ETFs.</p><p>‍</p><p>This video is really helpful on how we build portfolios:</p><figure id="w-node-be3c1379f79e-61a1988f"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RdCBQ2DA0o"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>There are so many companies that claim to provide sustainable investments — why should we trust yours?</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Transparency. One of our greatest personal frustrations with the sustainable/ethical investing space is that so many companies end up saying some equivalent of "this is great, just trust us." How they make decisions to include and exclude is really unclear. That's hard from an ethical perspective, but also a financial one. How do I know what criteria you'll be using to make these decisions in the future? Greenwashing is super real and it's unfortunately common in the sustainable investment space. You can find exactly what's in our portfolios and the logic behind our decision-making on our <a href="http://www.carboncollective.co/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>We believe that investing with the total stock market in low-fee index funds is the smartest way for average investors like you and me to invest over the long term. So we wanted to build a way to invest like that but for the world as if it had already transitioned off of fossil fuels. And we believe we've built the best way for doing that.</p><p>‍</p><p>One question we do get a lot is something like: <em>"This is great! But you're new. What happens if Carbon Collective doesn't make it as a company?"</em> This is such a good question and a very reasonable concern. The worst case scenario is this: you have a mild hassle to electronically transfer your account somewhere else. Your shares are your shares. We guarantee that we will help you transfer them somewhere else.</p><p>‍</p><p>And who actually holds your stocks and bonds? We work with an online software brokerage called Altruist. They're you're portal to access your account, withdraw, and deposit funds, get tax docs, etc. They work with one of the largest custodians in the country (the company that holds your stocks/bonds) called Apex. Should we not make it, we have our transfer guarantee. We'll work with you to electronically transfer your account to a different custodian (like Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood, etc.).</p><p><br><strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Other than Carbon Collective, what are some of your favorite tools and resources for fighting climate change?</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>We really like Saul Griffith's <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/" target="_blank">Rewiring America</a>. It's a clear guide on what we need to do to fight climate change which basically involved electrifying everything.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is one thing you wish more people understood about the movement for a more sustainable future?</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Be forgiving. We all have a part to play and it's not the exact same part. I had a great conversation with a professor in the UK the other day. He's trying to find the right way to use his skills to fight climate change. He was looking at different places he could help individuals make change and it came out that he actually works with a number of fossil fuel companies on projects. He admitted that he does a lot of things that I wouldn't approve of. He drives, eats plenty of meat, and will take grant money from these companies.</p><p>‍</p><p>I observed in myself my urge to judge him. To tell him he's wrong and hypocritical for doing all of those things. But I didn't voice it because I don't think that's how change happens. No, I told him that his part to play is actually within these companies. It's on us on the outside, who can take a more strident view to shift the conversation, the Overton Window, of what is socially expected. It's on people like him to be on the inside. Someone who knows all of the details of where a company is today, a trusted source that can say, "we're getting all this pressure, …</p></div></div>

I chose to track the lifetime as ticks or frame count.</p><p font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3">It will be responsible for four aspects:</p><ul><li font-family="systemSans" color="neutral.0" font-size="2,3"><strong>Creating</strong> the particles and seeding their initial attributes.

The fun thing about particle systems is that you can tweak their behaviour in all kinds of exciting ways.

We start by picking a random start position. Based on the bounds, we calculate a random end position—a different one for each particle. Now we have a start point and an endpoint. With a bit of trigonometry, we can calculate the angle between them. And then calculate a lunch velocity as a function of the distance between the two points.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>setEndLocation</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> width<span>,</span> height <span>}</span><span>,</span> x<span>,</span> y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/52feade06f2fecbf006889a904d221e6a730c194/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667" alt=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url">Github link</a></p>

<p>PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration) is a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03808">algorithm</a> published in 2020 that generates a high resolution facial image from a low resolution one. The main idea is to encode a low resolution image to a latent variable with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a>, change the latent variable a little bit, and generate a new but highly similar image.</p>

<p>To make it easier for anyone to try out PULSE, I wrote a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb">COLAB notebook</a> that takes an image URL (such as those obtained from Google image search), performs downsampling, and then upsampling with PULSE.</p>

<p>Instruction to run</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ctawong/PULSE_from_image_url/blob/master/PULSE_URL.ipynb">COLAB notebook</a></li>
  <li>Click “Connect” button on top right to connect to the GPU server.</li>
  <li>Replace Photo_URL with an URL of your interest</li>
  <li>Click the play button on the left of the second cell.</li>
</ol>

<p>It usually takes a minute or two to generate a new image.</p>

<p>Below are a few examples. Image on the left is the original, middle one is the downsampled original, and the right one is the image generated by PULSE.</p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse1.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty good! You may think. Things go a bit haywire with some images…</p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse3.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse4.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse_senior1.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://ctawong.com/assets/uploads/pulse_senior2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, the generator is biased towards white young-looking adults. In fact there have been a lot of discussion around bias implicit in machine learning models. To sum up, it’s all about the training data. The models simply fill in the gap based on what they saw from the training data. The PULSE model was trained with the a <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset">dataset of Flickr images</a> and inherited all its bias. The bias issue can likely be resolved by carefully selecting a dataset with diverse age, ethnicity and gender.</p>

            <div id="content-text">
                <p>Modern web design often makes use of <strong>large introduction hero images</strong>. These large images frame a product or service at the top of the website. Making these interactive often increases time spent on site.</p>
<p>This got me thinking of how we could use WebGL to make an interactive 'hero' banner, while also looking a bit like a piece of art. What I created was something similar to Van Gogh's "Starry Night", which nicely transforms into liquid if you want it to.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/smpnjn/pen/mdrBXQr">Link to Demo</a></p>
<p><img src="https://fjolt.com/images/misc/23122020.webp" alt="Short animated image of the WebGL art effect" loading="lazy"></p><h2>Step 1. Three.JS</h2>
<p>Three.js is a Javascript library which allows you to create WebGL 3d objects with ease. To accomplish our effect we will be following a few key steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. <strong>Create the geometry</strong> (shape) with Three.JS</li>
    <li>2. <strong>Render</strong> this onto a HTML5 canvas</li>
    <li>3. Pass this geometry data to <strong>shaders</strong></li>
    <li>4. <strong>Animate</strong> this using Javascript</li>
    <li>5. <strong>Manipulate the geometry</strong> with the shaders</li>
</ul>
<p>So with that in mind, lets take a look at a snippet of our Javascript, which covers the first 3 points.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I haven't included all the details, but here are some of the key points:
</p><ul>
    <li>The uniform variables in <code>uniforms: {}</code> are passed directly to the shader code we will write. When we update these, it will allow us to live update our 3d object.</li>
    <li>The shaders locations are mentioned in the ShaderMaterial() function</li>
    <li>We then request an animation frame to re-render the 3d object. Notice in the animate() function we increase t (time) and the uniform variable, creating the animation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2. Shaders</h2>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with what shaders are, they essentially allow you to manipulate the color of a geometry and the position of a geometry. There are two types of shaders, fragments (for colors) and vertex (for positions). <strong>These alter the shape before it is rendered.</strong></p>
<p>For this tutorial our main focus is the fragment shader. We will be using noise to generate the liquid effect, and the specific noise we will be using is called fractal brownian noise (FBM). An example of the noise created by FBM is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://fjolt.com/images/misc/231220201.webp" alt="Image of fractal brownian noise"></p>
<p>Don't worry, you don't need to know how to create these noise effects, and in fact one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">won an oscar</a>. The full code for these noise functions are available online and you can find the ones we will use in the GitHub Repo for this demo, in the <code>shaders/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Our vertex shader is the pretty simple, so lets focus on the fragment shader. The code (with comments) is shown below:</p>
<pre><p>shell <span>Copy</span></p><code>

// Main <span>function</span>
void <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    // We have to adjust the effect to fit our resolution.
    // Heavily modified FBM <span>function</span> from https://thebookofshaders.com/13/
    vec2 res <span>=</span> <span>(</span>gl_FragCoord.xy + <span>100</span>.<span>)</span> / <span>(</span>u_resolution.xy * u_scale<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    // Next lets get our colors
    vec3 highColor <span>=</span> rgb<span>(</span>u_highColor.r, u_highColor.g, u_highColor.b<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    vec3 lowColor <span>=</span> rgb<span>(</span>u_lowColor.r, u_lowColor.g, u_lowColor.b<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    // Set a random color
    vec3 color <span>=</span> vec3<span>(</span><span>23.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    // This is a randomised <span>function</span> based on fbm and some other variables
    // that we can adjust <span>in</span> our Javascript
    vec2 fbm1 <span>=</span> vec2<span>(</span><span>10</span>.<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    fbm1.x <span>=</span> fbm<span>(</span> res + <span>0.05</span> * u_time<span>)</span> * snoise<span>(</span>res<span>)</span> * u_goCrazy<span>;</span>
    fbm1.y <span>=</span> fbm<span>(</span> res + vec2<span>(</span><span>3.0</span><span>))</span> / <span>(</span>u_manipulate - snoise<span>(</span>res<span>))</span> * <span>9</span>. * u_goCrazy / u_veinDefinition * u_clickLength * <span>5</span>.<span>;</span>

    // Next we adjust it all based on mouse position, time, and qfbm1
    vec2 r <span>=</span> vec2<span>(</span><span>0</span>.<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    r.x <span>=</span> fbm<span>(</span> res + fbm1 * u_time * <span>0.1</span> <span>)</span> + -sin<span>(</span>u_mouse.x<span>)</span> + <span>600</span>.<span>;</span>
    r.y <span>=</span> fbm<span>(</span> res + fbm1 * u_time * <span>0.5</span> <span>)</span> * -u_mouse.y<span>;</span>

    // And create a float of fbm, <span>for</span> <span>use</span> <span>in</span> the final color
    float f <span>=</span> fbm<span>(</span>res+r<span>)</span> * <span>1</span>.<span>;</span>

    // Then we mix all our colors together
    color <span>=</span> mix<span>(</span>highColor*2., lowColor, f*3.<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    color <span>=</span> mix<span>(</span>color, lowColor, clamp<span>(</span>length<span>(</span>fbm1<span>)</span>,0.0,2.0<span>))</span><span>;</span> // * snoise<span>(</span>st<span>)</span> * <span>51.9</span>
    color <span>=</span> mix<span>(</span>color, highColor, clamp<span>(</span>length<span>(</span>r.y<span>)</span>,0.0,3.0<span>))</span><span>;</span>

    // And output them <span>for</span> render
    gl_FragColor <span>=</span> vec4<span>((</span>f*f*f*0.9*f*f+.5*f<span>)</span>*color,1.<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
    
</code></pre>
<p>The cool thing about this particular fragment shader is that it renders as a cool stylised art effect for our demo, but if we increase the settings it can also double as a pretty simple liquid water fragment shader.</p>
<p>Our uniform variables are all defined at the top of the fragment shader but not listed above. They are listed in the form <code>uniform float u_variableName;</code>. 

</p><h2>Step 3. Event Listeners</h2>
<p>Finally, we add some typical event listeners to our code to track mouse position, as well as the range selector positions. This allows us to adjust the effect and animate it as the user moves around.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most straightfoward and vanilla JS part. For the most part, we are simply updating the uniform variables through the mesh we defined before - <code>mesh.material.uniforms...</code>. When these are updated, our <code>animate()</code> function rerenders the new object in our HTML5 canvas, so our cursor position and interaction with the canvas has real time effects on the WebGL code.</p>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

Born from research at MIT and Michigan State University, founded on the principle of seamlessly integrating solar technology into everyday products and surfaces. They have since developed a transparent solar coating that integrates into standard windows, with endless possibilities for future applications.</span></p><h3 id="viewer-enp20"><span>Physee</span></h3><p id="viewer-1n23a"><span>The European manufacturer <a href="https://www.physee.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Physee</u></a> was actually the first to install transparent solar panels.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        <p>If I am to start working on a new project today, I would hesitate to attempt it in a language that does not have compile-time type checking. However, I do have to deal with Python at work (though we are slowly phasing it out). Also, I have been working off and on, in my spare time, on a Python project that has over the past 3+ years gotten fairly large as personal projects go. It started out as a one-off quick script. It eventually evolved into something larger that actually does something useful for me so I ended up adding to it and maintaining it.</p>

<p>Somewhere over a year and a half back, after being frustrated with my inability to refactor this code like I can with other type safe languages, I started exploring the possibility of adding type hints to the codebase. Now, after having spent the requisite time to understand the implications of type hinting, and whether it’s useful, and to be able to show this as a consolidation of my thoughts on the matter to friends and colleagues, I decided to write this post on what an <strong>absolute joy</strong> it has become to refactor and work with Python once you have type checking enforced.</p>

<p>Just to set expectations right: the following is more of gushing praise for <code>mypy</code> rather than <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html">a tutorial on how to use it</a>. If you are already using <code>mypy</code> on a regular basis, you are likely going to learn little from what follows. This is written with the hope of giving other friends of mine who are Python programmers an overview of starting with type annotations, if they aren’t already using them by detailing the nice things it provides. It also details some of the effort you will likely need to pay up front to make type-checking effective in your codebase, and the rough edges (yes, there are some) in the type annotation system that will likely cause you some annoyance.</p>

<p>Another expectation I’d like to calibrate is for people coming to this from a language with a sophisticated type system such as Rust or Haskell, or even more traditional type systems like Java and C++. These are things you take for granted and you will likely scoff at some of the things written here. However, I urge you to look at the benefits the following provide to the current state of Python programming that has no static type checking.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-type-annotations-in-python">Overview of Type Annotations in Python</h2>

<p>First things first: Python, back from versions 3.5+, has already had support for type annotations. It is detailed in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484">PEP 484</a>. This means that you can write functions that look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, the Python interpreter in no way enforces it, and will not enforce it in future. Python is expected to remain a dynamically typed language for the foreseeable future. The above function will run happily if called with <code>sum("hello", "world")</code> and return a concatenation of the two strings contrary to the intended use of the function. The Python interpreter simply ignores the type annotations.</p>

<p>However, you can use third party type checkers which will do static analysis of your code based on these type annotations and point out any type errors lurking in your code. The introduction of type annotations as part of the language syntax itself provides for much better aesthetics as compared to having to retrofit the type hints via code comments (a la Flow for pre ES6 JavaScript) and better ergonomics as compared to needing a transpiler to convert a new augmented language to valid vanilla code (like Typescript does).</p>

<p>One such type-checker is <code>mypy</code> - the earliest implementation of its kind that some of the Python core team are involved in, including the venerable Guido Van Rossum. However, note that<code>mypy</code> is a distinct from the Python interpreter and <a href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/">maintained as a separate project</a>. You will need to download and install it separately.</p>

<p>Running <code>mypy</code> on a file containing the aforementioned invocation of the <code>sum</code> function above with string arguments results in the following error from the type checker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Argument 2 to "sum" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>mypy</code> is not the only type checker out there. There are other type checkers such as <code>Pyright</code> from Microsoft and <code>pyre</code> from Facebook. However, my experience with them is limited and the following notes are based on my experience with <code>mypy</code> exclusively.</p>

<h2 id="things-i-love">Things I love</h2>

<p>The trivial example that I stated above does not do justice to the sophistication that <code>mypy</code> brings. While you will need to grapple with installing, configuring it and running it on your code, in this section I’ll be detailing some of my favourite things it facilitates once you pay that price.</p>

<h3 id="optional-values-strictly-enforced">Optional Values, Strictly Enforced</h3>

<p>If there is a single thing that you can take away from this post, it ought to be the unreasonable effectiveness of strictly checked optional values. Just this one feature has had such a dramatic improvement on my code correctness that I cannot emphasise this enough.</p>

<p>Errors in software arising from not checking for nulls is <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/">“a billion dollar problem”</a> and <code>mypy</code> is an invaluable guard against them. The primary type annotation (<em>type modifier</em> in <code>mypy</code> terms) that helps with this is the <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns#result-container"><code>Optional</code></a> annotation. In my opinion, explicitly handling and indicating where a value can be null fosters greater code correctness as  to approaches in languages like Java where any value can potentially be null.</p>

<p>Consider a canonical ‘customer record’ management scenario (yes, I’m unimaginative like that). Presumably, a simple customer type could be defined like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this type, we encode the fact that we may sometime not have the customer’s address registered in our database, into the type itself. In vanilla Python without annotations, we would have just defined it as a string with the possibility that it may be <code>None</code> that we need to ‘remember’ any time we used it.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the utility of <code>Optional</code> type used in conjunction with <code>mypy</code>, let’s look at a (slightly contrived) example of an implementation checking how far a customer resides from our store. To simplify the example, we abstract away the details of looking up a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple">Geocoding service</a> and code to calculate distance between two geo-coordinates.</p>

<p>A first iteration of this code might look like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># A type alias for a (lat, long) tuple
</span><span>Coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tuple</span><span>[</span><span>float</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>input_address</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Coords</span><span>]:</span>
    <span># ... snip ...
</span>    <span># Geocoding API lookup
</span>    <span># Hardcoding return for now
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>12.972442</span><span>,</span> <span>77.580643</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>coord1</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>,</span> <span>coord2</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span># ... snip ...
</span>    <span># Distance computation
</span>    <span># Hardcoding return for now
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>3.5</span>

<span># WARNING: Buggy code below
</span><span>def</span> <span>get_delivery_distance</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>:</span> <span>Customer</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span><span>)</span> <span># Errors here
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>geo_coords</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this through <code>mypy</code> generates the following errors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>geo.py:18: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "Optional[Tuple[float, float]]", variable has type "Tuple[float, float]")
geo.py:18: error: Argument 1 to "geo_lookup" has incompatible type "Optional[str]"; expected "str"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can imagine, this is quite a lifesaver in more real world conditions. <code>mypy</code> just caught the error of using <code>customer.address</code> without checking if it is <code>None</code>. It also caught the bug where we are trying to assign the <code>geo_coords</code> value to the return from <code>geo_lookup</code> without accounting for the fact that it too can return <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>The corrected version of the <code>get_delivery_distance</code> would look like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_delivery_distance</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>:</span> <span>Customer</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Coords</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>float</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Coords</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>geo_lookup</span><span>(</span><span>customer</span><span>.</span><span>address</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>geo_coords</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>calculate_distance_in_miles</span><span>(</span><span>geo_coords</span><span>,</span> <span>store_coords</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we take change the return type of <code>get_delivery_address</code> to account for the possibility that it may be <code>None</code>. Furthermore, we expressly handle both the possibility of <code>customer.address</code> being <code>None</code> as well as the return from the geocoding lookup service being <code>None</code>. As you see, <code>mypy</code> cleverly infers that you have indeed handled the <code>None</code> cases appropriately and hence does not throw errors in the new code.</p>

<p>As you can observe, this enforcement of checking for optional values cascades through your codebase and <code>mypy</code> is always looking over your shoulders to warn you against potential places where you have not handled them. Furthermore, it’s very cool that <code>mypy</code> manages to do a significant amount of type inference based on the conditional blocks, looking for checks for <code>None</code>. Contrast this with languages like C++ where, in code written with the equivalent  <code>std::optional</code> calls to <code>std::optional::value()</code> method will happily compile, and fail at runtime throwing a <code>bad_optional_access</code> exception if in fact it holds only a null value.</p>

<p>If you are a Rust or Haskell programmer, you are at this point cringing at all the conditional checks, and missing your <code>Either</code> s and <code>Maybe</code>s. There are some <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns#result-container">third party libraries</a> that (sorta) provide these for you though I have not used these in my code.</p>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>The irony of lauding the support for generics in the type annotations of a language that is intrinsically dynamically typed is not lost on me. Nevertheless, as soon as you enter the world that is typed Python even if it’s make believe, you start needing generics. Thankfully, the support for it is quite nice.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet plagiarised entirely from the <code>mypy</code> <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#defining-generic-classes">documentation</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Stack</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>]):</span>

        <span># Create an empty list with items of type T

<p>This is a rough idea for an admittedly not hugely useful technical 
hack related to low-level network protocol gubbins. If you don't want to 
know about this, look away now.</p>

<p>I will assume you know what <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">TCP</a> is (oh - i'll
warn you now that i say 'packet' instead of 'segment' throughout this
document; i'm like that). I will assume you know what the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xns/syssocket.h.html">POSIX
socket API</a> almost universally used to access it is. What you may or
may not know about are the two things i'm going to talk about today: the
sequenced packet (aka SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket type from the socket API
and the urgent pointer from the TCP specification.</p>

<p>The socket API supports sockets of several types; 'type' does not
refer to the protocol behind the socket, but rather to the semantics
associated with the socket. The best-known socket types are stream
(SOCK_STREAM) and datagram (SOCK_DGRAM); the former supplies a pair of
full-duplex, reliable, ordered, structureless byte streams connected to
a single remote socket, while the latter supplies an aperture through
which unreliable, unordered, smallish bundles of bytes can be sent to
multiple remote sockets. There are, however, other socket types; the 
most interesting is the sequenced-packet socket (SOCK_SEQPACKET). The <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_10.html">actual 
text</a> of the socket API specification says of sequenced packet 
sockets:</p>

<blockquote>The SOCK_SEQPACKET socket type is similar to the SOCK_STREAM
type, and is also connection-oriented. The only difference between these
types is that record boundaries are maintained using the SOCK_SEQPACKET
type. A record can be sent using one or more output operations and
received using one or more input operations, but a single operation
never transfers parts of more than one record. Record boundaries are
visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag in the received message
flags returned by the recvmsg() function. It is protocol-specific
whether a maximum record size is imposed.</blockquote>

<p>So basically, it's either a sequence of packets which are delivered
reliably and in order, or a reliable, ordered stream with record
boundaries in it, depending on how you look at it. Either way, it's
clearly halfway between stream (ie TCP) and datagram (ie UDP) sockets.
The stuff about MSG_EOR is how you mark the ends of messages; messages
are read and written like stream data, but with a couple of nuances: to
mark the end of a message when sending, set the MSG_EOR flag in the last
send(), and to detect the end of a message when receiving, use recvmsg()
and look for the MSG_EOR flag in the msghdr.msg_flags field.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, that line saying "a record can be sent using one or
more output operations and received using one or more input operations"
is a bit weird; the specs for recv() and recvmsg() say "for
message-based sockets such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire
message must be read in a single operation.". There's a <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/austin-review-l/msg00839.html">post
on an Open Group mailing list</a> on the semantics of the MSG_WAITALL
flag in the context of sequenced packet sockets which indicates that
messages on a sequenced packet socket can indeed be delivered through
multiple recv() calls, which does make more sense; you can then use
MSG_WAITALL to force delivery in a single read, although it doesn't work
if the message is bigger than your buffer)</p>

<p>Moreover, sequenced packet sockets are probably the most
programmer-friendly kind: they have strong reliability and ordering
guarantees (like TCP but unlike UDP), and they provide record
demarcation at the protocol level (like UDP but unlike TCP); they should
therefore be a key tool for network programmers. However, as far as i
can tell, there is no internet transport-layer protocol in common use
which has sequenced packet semantics; SOCK_SEQPACKET is therefore not a
generally available socket type! Where it does turn up is when you're
running connections straight over ATM or IR or other suitable link
layers, and nobody cares about that.</p>

<p>But all is not lost! I have come up with a way to supply sequenced
packet semantics using entirely normal TCP, by exploiting a little-used
but historically ancient feature of that protocol which, i think, was
designed expressely for that purpose: the urgent pointer.</p>

<p>The TCP spec is pretty brief, so have a read through and see what it
says about the the urgent pointer. Basically, it's a facility by which
one end of a TCP connection can indicate to the other that there's
urgent data somewhere in the stream. From the client (ie
application-layer protocol) point of view, it looks like there's a
button next to the output stream of each socket, with a red light next
to the input stream of the other, both labelled 'URGENT!!!'; one end
writes some data that it thinks is urgent, then hits the button: the
light at the other end then goes on immediately, and goes off once the
client has read all the data that the sender had written before hitting
the button. The TCP modules handle this by dint of two components of
their packets: the 'urgent pointer field significant' (aka URG) control
bit, and the urgent pointer (UP). The URG bit is set in all packets sent
after the button is pressed, up to and including the one containing the
last byte of urgent data; the presence of a set URG bit in a packet
therefore indicates to the receiving TCP module that it should switch on
the urgency light. The UP points to the last byte of the urgent data
(RFC 793 is confused about this - see <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC 1122</a>, section
4.2.2.4, for the correction); the receiving module can turn off the
urgency light once the client has read that byte.</p>

<p>For completeness, i should point out that the UP field in the TCP
header is actually only 16 bits long; it expresses the UP as an offset
from the sequence number of the packet. RFC 793 is cagey about what
happens when the UP is more than 65535 greater than the current sequence
number, but <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2147.txt" a="">RFC
2147</a> says, inter alia:</p>

<blockquote>When a TCP packet is to be sent with an Urgent Pointer
(i.e., the URG bit set), first calculate the offset from the Sequence
Number to the Urgent Pointer. If the offset is less than 65535, fill in
the Urgent field and continue with the normal TCP processing. If the
offset is greater than 65535, and the offset is greater than or equal to
the length of the TCP data [which it will be, unless you're dealing with
super-jumbograms], fill in the Urgent Pointer with 65535 and continue
with the normal TCP processing.</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, i propose abusing the urgent mechanism to mark the ends of
messages: the urgent pointer simply points to the end of the current
message. Rather than connecting this to buttons and lights, the
seqpacket-aware TCP module does the right thing with MSG_EOR: MSG_EOR
being set in send() causes the UP to be set, and hitting the UP when
doing recvmsg() causes it to set MSG_EOR. Simple!</p>

<p>There is one little problem, which is that you can't pack multiple
messages into a single TCP packet, since you wouldn't be able to have
the UP pointing at the ends of all of them. This is a shame, but not
that big a deal; the whole sequenced packet thing is about reasonably
big packets. If a burning need for multiple messages per packets was
felt, w e could specify a negotiable TCP option to hold additional
message-end pointers.</p>

<p>There is some degree of interaction between the mechanism i describe
and TCP's push function. The push function was specified in part so that
applications can indicate to the TCP module when they'd got to the end
of a block of data, so that it does not waste time waiting for more;
with explicit message boundaries, it can work this out itself. TCP
modules should send less-than-MTU packets when and only when a message
end is signalled; the rest of the time, they should wait for enough data
from the client to fill a complete packet, without any timeout. As well
as rendering the push function obsolete, explicit message boundaries
also make Nagle's algorithm unnecessary. The push function can, however,
be repurposed: explicit pushes can be applied to indicate that a message
should be delivered as quickly as possible (the push should be signalled
in the same send that delivers the end-of-message indication). The TCP
modules should then do everything they can to deliver the message
quickly, and should indicate to the user that the message was pushed. 
Both these interactions with the user can be mediated by a MSG_PUSH flag
in the send() or recvmsg() flags (and perhaps a MSG_PUSH_PENDING flag in
recvmsg(), to indicate that a message somewhere ahead is being pushed).
The push would be communicated in the TCP packets by the setting of the
PSH flag, as now. We might even enable out-of-order delivery of the
pushed message, but that would be very weird. In essence, we're swapping
the semantics of the push and urgent functions!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Every few years there comes a technology that people get hyped about, everyone wants to be a specialist in that field because it appears to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Between 2015-2019 this was largely about bitcoins and blockchain technology. Everyone wanted to be a specialist in blockchain technology. Bitcoin was booming, ICOs were happening to the left and right.</p>
<p>And people were trying to introduce/incorporate blockchain technology into everything they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>Yes sometimes blockchain technology can improve the existing system. However, when you try to introduce blockchain or any other technology into something that doesn’t require it,the results can be disastrous.</p>
<p>This is a story I wanted to write for a very long time, it was about a small startup called BlockEvent. A small startup that wanted to incorporate blockchain technology into event management.</p>
<p><em>Their website blockevent.tk is now not functioning, and I was unable to find a web archive snapshot. A mirror exists on a different domain, please check the footnotes.</em></p>
<p>Blockchain on event management has been there before BlockEvents. Smart ticketing and smart contracts are currently being used to improve the ticketing field and control pricing etc.</p>
<h2>BlockEvent</h2>
<p>BlockEvents wanted to make the whole event process a decentralized mechanism. From user data, to events, to registration, everything was supposed to be “decentralized” and was “not accessible” to and “not modifiable” by anyone.</p>
<p>According to the BlockEvent team, </p>
<blockquote><p>We made BlockEvent as a decentralized system. That means no central party can control this booking process and it will work without any third party involvement. </p><p>BlockEvent acts as a bridge between the organizers and the participants where organizers come and create events through our system, and participants can come and book their tickets. </p><p>The whole process is done through Public Blockchain.</p><p>… </p><p>Using the blockchain for user identity management is a whole new paradigm.</p><cite>BlockEvent on one of their Facebook posts, describing their system. </cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent when initially started mainly hosted monthly blockchain event meetup events. However, their big break came in May 2019, during the annual Google I/O.</p>
<p>Google I/O event is celebrated in Sri Lanka every year, with local tech companies hosting events of their own, with local influencers, while live streaming the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>The selection process is a very completions, hundreds of people compete for few limited number of seats. These events are a good place to network and meet new friends in IT field. Plus you end up getting some cool swags.</p>
<p>In order to be selected to these events you need to show that you are a tech person, usually they check your GitHub page, blog or YouTube channel. And the tech company will select and send an invitation to whom they think are the most suitable to attend their events.</p>
<p>Until 2018, this was done by using a simple Google form or a regular website.</p>
<p>However, in 2019, one of the largest tech and telecom companies in Sri Lanka decided to use BlockEvents to host their Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Getting selected by a big company like them to manage their Google I/O event was big deal, because they host one of the largest I/O events in Sri Lanka. And BlockEvent can leverage this to opportunity to get bigger clients in future.</p>
<p>It was their make or break moment. They had to nail it, and if they failed then for a small startup like BlockEvent, the damage to their reputation is going to hurt them to a point where there is no return.</p>
<h2><strong>Disaster</strong> </h2>
<p>BlockEvent also in their description, said this,</p>
<blockquote><p>To ensure the user data privacy and security, <strong>we are not storing any user credentials or password</strong>[s] <strong>in our database. Even the user emails are stored as a hash. Only the users know their passwords </strong>and that will provide 100% control over your account actions. Even BlockEvent team can’t access your accounts. </p><cite>BlockEvent describing their system in a Facebook post</cite></blockquote>
<p>Since they were storing <strong>everything </strong>in the blockchain, they were not storing even user emails and passwords. This may sound as a good privacy focused system. But this will come to hurt BlockEvent in a very bad way.</p>
<p>Since no one else other than the people in monthly blockchain meetups knew about BlockEvents, like in any other new service, most people registering for the local Google I/O event used either throwaway passwords, or new passwords which they forgot or didn’t save.</p>
<p>This caused large number of people to forget their passwords. If we use a normal database to store user data, with no hashing, they would have been able to reset the user passwords.</p>
<p>However, since everything is stored in blockchain, and everything were hashed, this meant that there is no way to reset a user password. </p>
<p>This led to large number of people being locked out of their accounts, unable to create new accounts with the existing emails, and BlockEvent team unable to reset passwords.</p>
<p>This caused a wave of negative reviews on BlockEvent Facebook page and on social media. Some users demanded the organizers to go back to the old system of using a Google form for user registration.</p>
<p>BlockEvent finally responded to their users, they had no way to reseat the password. Unless you remember the password and login, or you are permanently locked out from using the account.</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to the rules of decentralization, we can’t reset your passwords as we are giving priority to user data and security.

<p>BlockEvent also asked participants to send their personal details on Facebook and via a Google form, so they can manually arrange a way to send the gift pack to the participants.</p>
<p>Some of the users accused the selection process was also flawed and complained that some of the people who were less qualified to attend the event were selected over them.</p>
<p>All this led to irreplaceable damage on BlockEvent, and the Google I/O event didn’t happen due to the Easter Sunday bombings. </p>
<p>BlockEvent went into hiatus few months later, all thought they never mentioned that they are shutting down, their website went offline once their domain name expired. Possibly signaling the end of the startup that hoped to decentralize how we manage identity online.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2>
<p>The title of the post is <strong>“Somethings are never meant to be invented”</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how utopian the idea may sound like, guaranteeing 100% user privacy with everything stored on a blockchain, not even giving access to user email to the creators can have its own drawbacks.</p>
<p>And since we are all humans, and we all tend to make mistakes, there has to be a fail safe mechanism, that will keep things in check and can undo the mistakes when we make one.</p>
<p>Also a single use password is a very bad idea, not only that users can lose their passwords, but also in the event of a data breach, user handing over the password to a third party by a mistake, how can the service reset the passwords? There are so many scenarios where things can go wrong.</p>
<p>May be an idea like BlockEvent were never meant to be invented.</p>
<p><strong>The currently hyped up technology may not be ideal for your system and instead a time tested solution may be the answer that you’re looking for.</strong></p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, I’m still open minded, at the same time but skeptical. I’m not yet ready to invest or build something on blockchain.</p>
<p>I still find it difficult to fully understand the idea of blockchain, what makes it different from a decentralized git repository? Why Git is easy to implement but blockchain is hard? </p>
<p>When it comes to BlockEvents, I think what they did was store the email and password both hashed on the blockchain, and when a user logs in, they match the submitted hashed email and hashed passwords against what’s stored in the blockchain, like we do it in a normal login system using a database, except the fact that we don’t hash the emails.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><em>I’m not a blockchain expert, so I don’t know the exact reason why BlockEvent was not able to reset the passwords.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it because they didn’t know the emails because they were hashed, or was it because once you put some information to the blockchain it is immutable, or was it due to both?</em></p>
<p><em>At the time when I saw this in 2019, I thought it was due to the fact that data is immutable on the blockchain, but now at the time of writing I feel it was due to the fact that the emails were stored on the blockchain in hashed format.</em></p>
<p><em>I also don’t know what really caused so many people to lose their password, my assumption is that they used a throwaway password, or a new password which they forgot. But still this number of users getting locked out is still unexplained.</em></p>
<p><em>After further Googling I was able to find a mirror of the original website on another domain name http://blockevent.ml</em></p>
<p><em>I tried logging in using my BlockEvent account, but I also have forgotten my BlockEvent password, and now I’m also locked out.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-cb7b2f22b997-f84b1cb7"><div><p>Hello, env0 and Terragrunt fans alike! It’s new-feature-day, yet again! But this time, we have something really special for you. We’re giving you the ability to completely change the game on the Infrastructure as Code files that you use to deploy and manage environments with our platform! Introducing remote-run support for <a href="https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/">Terragrunt</a> workflows, now available in <a href="http://env0.com/">env0</a>! Remote-run workflows allow for everyone on the team to be able to have visibility into the deployments of others on the team and removes the visibility issues of locally-run workflows. Also, env0 allows you to manage these environments from deploy to destroy. Running Terragrunt on env0 allows you to empower your workflows with <a href="https://docs.env0.com/docs/policies">Policies &amp; Governance</a> and <a href="https://docs.env0.com/docs/user-management">RBAC</a>.</p><p>But, what if you aren’t very familiar with Terragrunt and its benefits yet? Well, let’s talk about it!</p><p><em>Terragrunt is a thin wrapper that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"><em>DRY</em></a><em> (</em><strong><em>D</em></strong><em>on’t </em><strong><em>R</em></strong><em>epeat </em><strong><em>Y</em></strong><em>ourself), working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote state.</em></p><p>But, what does keeping your configurations “dry” mean? Having dry configs allows you to sanitize your terraform configuration files for use in multiple environments at once. Let’s say your code looks like this:</p><blockquote>└── live<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;├── prod<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;├── qa<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;└── stage<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── main.tf<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── main.tf</blockquote><p>Each one of the environments have multiple components. In a traditional Terraform environment, you would have multiple sets of the same configuration files, that are all almost the same, but you have to edit the specific config info for each of the different environments. With Terragrunt, you can have “remote terraform configurations” where you store the clean terraform files in a separate repo, and then just call on it in remotely from any place you need it, and only put the Terragrunt configs for each specific environment in their corresponding place.</p><blockquote>└── live<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;├── prod<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;├── qa<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; ├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; │ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;└── stage<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;├── app<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;├── mysql<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;│ &nbsp; └── terragrunt.hcl<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── vpc<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;└── terragrunt.hcl</blockquote><p>This kind of operation can be very helpful when you have a lot of different environments or very complex environments at scale.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<p>Some people say that Go can’t express good abstractions. They mostly refer to the lack of generics.
That’s because in most object-oriented languages, people are used to creating abstractions around
types. In Go, the right way is to create abstractions around behaviour using interfaces. When you
follow this principle, you find that Go is very powerful at creating abstractions.</p>

<p>In this post, I am going to explore a way of creating abstractions using the <em>‘good old composite
pattern’</em> from the book called ‘Design patterns’. Combined with higher-order functions, this pattern
is not only powerful, but also convenient. I will</p>

<ol>
<li>Explain what the composite pattern is.</li>
<li>Show how it can be combined with <em>higher-order functions</em> and closures.</li>
<li>Present a way I used it to create an <strong>audio library</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why the hell are you going to talk about design patterns? Those are for Java and Java is bad, we
don’t like design patterns in Go!</strong></p>

<p>Uhm, well, you’re right, we usually don’t like design patterns in Go. But, bear with me, this is
only going to be about one of them and it’s gonna be interesting, I promise.</p>

<h2 id="first-example-arithmetic-expressions">First example: arithmetic expressions</h2>

<p>The composite pattern revolves around a single idea:</p>

<p><strong><em>Everything satisfies a single interface and complex things are composed from simple ones.</em></strong></p>

<p>It might not be entirely clear what this means, so let’s dive directly into the code.</p>

<p>In this first example, we’ll be creating a system to create and evaluate arithmetic expressions. We
need to start by creating the <em>one single interface</em>. It’s clear that an interface representing an
<em>expression</em> will be the right choice. This way, we’ll be able to create simple expressions and
create more complicated expressions by composing simpler ones using various operators.</p>

<p>To make things even simpler, we won’t even define an interface. A function type is sufficient here.</p>

<pre><code>type Expr func() float64
</code></pre>

<p>So, an expression is a function which evaluates to <code>float64</code>. An interface equivalent would be an
interface with a single method, say <code>Eval</code>.</p>

<p>The most simple expression is one that returns a constant. Let’s call it <code>Const</code>. Here’s the
constructor.</p>

<pre><code>func Const(x float64) Expr {
        return func() float64 {
                return x
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can define a composite constructor, say a one which sums other expressions. It takes an
aribirary number of other expressions and evaluates to their sum.</p>

<pre><code>func Sum(exs ...Expr) Expr {
        return func() float64 {
                sum := 0.0
                for _, ex := range exs {
                        sum += ex()
                }
                return sum
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The expression returned from the <code>Sum</code> constructor simply adds the results of the other expressions
together. Note, that we call <code>ex()</code> inside the loop, because the <code>Expr</code> type is a function and
calling it yields the result.</p>

<p>Now we have some material to start using our arithmetic expressions library.</p>

<pre><code>ex1 := Sum(Const(1), Const(2), Const(3))
fmt.Println(ex1()) // prints 6

ex2 := Sum(Const(1), Sum(Const(2), Const(3)))
fmt.Println(ex2()) // prints 6 alike
</code></pre>

<p>We can create more expressions. <code>Ref</code> always returns the value of a variable it is pointing to.</p>

<pre><code>func Ref(x *float64) Expr {
        return func() float64 {
                return *x
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can do funny things :)</p>

<pre><code>x := 1.0
ex := Sum(Ref(&amp;x), Ref(&amp;x))

x = ex() // x = 2
x = ex() // x = 4
x = ex() // x = 8
x = ex() // x = 16
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is neat. This is just a little toy example, to give you the taste. Let’s go ahead to
another example. Still a toy one, but a little less toy one.</p>

<h2 id="second-example-sequences">Second example: sequences</h2>

<p>Now, we will use the composite pattern to assemble sequences of numbers. Finite or inifinite,
doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Once again, we need to start by creating the single interface. Obviously, this interface will
represent a sequence. The interface will contain a single method called <code>Next</code>. This method returns
the next element in the sequence and <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on whether we already reached the
end of the sequence.</p>

<pre><code>type Seq interface {
        Next() (x float64, ok bool)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We could use a function type again, but I decided to use a proper interface, for clarity.
Nonetheless, we can create a helper function type, which will simplify creating instances of the
interface.</p>

<pre><code>type SeqFunc func() (x float64, ok bool)

func (sf SeqFunc) Next() (x float64, ok bool) {
        return sf()
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>SeqFunc</code> is a function type which satisfies the <code>Seq</code> interface by implementing the <code>Next</code>
function returning the result of itself. This pattern is also used in the standard library with
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#HandlerFunc"><code>http.HandlerFunc</code></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start creating actual <code>Seq</code> implementations.</p>

<p>The simplest one is a sequence created from a slice. We’ll call it <code>Mk</code> (make a sequence).</p>

<pre><code>func Mk(vals ...float64) Seq {
        i := 0
        return SeqFunc(func() (x float64, ok bool) {
                if i &gt;= len(vals) {
                        return 0, false
                }
                x = vals[i]
                i++
                return x, true
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Mk</code> sequence tracks the current index in the slice it was created from. Every time <code>Next</code> is
called, the current value is returned and the index is incremented. When we reach the end of the
slice, we simply return <code>0, false</code>.</p>

<p>A complement function to <code>Mk</code> is <code>Collect</code>, which takes a <code>Seq</code> and collects it into a slice of
numbers. This is obviously only applicable to finite sequences.</p>

<pre><code>func Collect(s Seq) []float64 {
        var vals []float64
        for {
                x, ok := s.Next()
                if !ok {
                        break
                }
                vals = append(vals, x)
        }
        return vals
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can turn a slice into a sequence and back again, very useful.</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Println(Collect(Mk(1, 2, 3))) // prints [1 2 3]
</code></pre>

<p>We can create an infinite sequence of natural numbers.</p>

<pre><code>func Naturals() Seq {
        n := 0.0
        return SeqFunc(func() (x float64, ok bool) {
                n++
                return n, true
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p>And we can create a composite which takes <code>n</code> first elements out of any sequence.</p>

<pre><code>func Take(n int, s Seq) Seq {
        return SeqFunc(func() (x float64, ok bool) {
                if n &lt;= 0 {
                        return 0, false
                }
                n--
                return s.Next()
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can generate <code>n</code> first natural numbers.</p>

<pre><code>fmt.Println(Collect(Take(10, Naturals())))
// [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
</code></pre>

<p>This is starting to feel like functional programming. And rightfully so. We are doing</p>

<ol>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Lazy evaluation and infinite sequences</li>
<li>Too long expressions :)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point is the most important. With the composite pattern, we’ve been able to create
building blocks and compose more complicated things out of them. Don’t believe me? Let’s create a
<code>Split</code> function, which takes a sequence and splits it into two sequences at a given index. <em>Just
watch!</em></p>

<pre><code>func Split(n int, s Seq) (l, r Seq) {
        return Mk(Collect(Take(n, s))...), s
}
</code></pre>

<p>That was easy! Make sure to understand it, should be fairly obvious.</p>

<p>To make the <code>Split</code> function, we didn’t have to write almost any code. All of the required pieces
were already present, we just needed to compose them in the right way. Hence, the composite pattern.</p>

<p>Let’s see how our <code>Split</code> function behaves.</p>

<pre><code>s := Take(7, Naturals())
l, r := Split(4, s)
fmt.Println(Collect(l), Collect(r))
// [1 2 3 4] [5 6 7]
</code></pre>

<p>Take seven naturals, split them at four and print the results. Simple, right?</p>

<p>When using the composite pattern, you’ll find it very easy to follow the DRY principle and you
usually end up writing much less code than otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Excercise:</strong> Create a <code>Dup</code> (duplicate) function, which takes a <code>Seq</code> and returns two <code>Seq</code>s which
are both identical (in terms of elements) to the original <code>Seq</code>. It should work for infinite
sequences too.</p>

<h2 id="real-thing-beep-audio-library">Real thing: Beep audio library</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve certainly got a hang of the composite pattern, let’s see how it can be used in a
real library. The library I’m talking about is an audio library I’ve been working on for the past
month. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/faiface/beep">Beep</a>, which is a name chosen from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6n1plq/choose_the_name_for_a_new_audio_library_in_go/">poll on
Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>First things first, the library is by no means only my work. The playback heavily depends on Hajime
Hoshi’s <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/hajimehoshi/oto">Oto</a> library and MP3 decoding depends on his
<a href="https://github.com/hajimehoshi/go-mp3">go-mp3</a> package.</p>

<p>The library is built around the composite pattern, for a great good. Let’s take a look!</p>

<h3 id="the-streamer-interface">The <code>Streamer</code> interface</h3>

<p>As usual, when designing around the composite pattern, the first thing is the single interface. In
case of Beep, this single interface is called <code>Streamer</code>. It’s very similar to the former one,
<code>Seq</code>.</p>

<p>Audio is composed of elements called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)"><em>samples</em></a>. A sample is a number on the
timeline in the interval [-1, +1] which specifies the pressure of the air at that moment. A
<code>Streamer</code> is pretty much a sequence of samples. However, getting the samples one by one as with
<code>Seq</code> would be way too inefficient. That’s why the <code>Streamer</code> interface is designed to stream a
number of samples at once.</p>

<p>Here’s how it looks like.</p>

<pre><code>type Streamer interface {
        Stream(samples [][2]float64) (n int, ok bool)
        Err() error
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Stream</code> method is given a slice of samples (there are two numbers per sample, the left and the
right channel), fills it with samples and advances the internal state (if any). It returns the
number of samples it streamed (filled in the slice). If the <code>Streamer</code> already reached it’s end and
has no samples to stream, it returns <code>false</code>. Otherwise, it returns <code>true</code>. The complete description
can be found in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/faiface/beep#Streamer">docs</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>Err</code> method is for handling errors, such as file and network errors. Errors are kept out of the
<code>Stream</code> method to simplify composition.</p>

<p>Similar to <code>Seq</code>, there is a helper function type which enables easy creation of <code>Streamer</code>s that
can’t error.</p>

<pre><code>type StreamerFunc func(samples [][2]float64) (n int, ok bool)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="loading-audio-files">Loading audio files</h3>

<p>Enough talking, let’s get to the code.</p>

<p>The simplest way to create a streamer is from an audio file. Beep currently supports
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/faiface/beep/wav">WAV</a> and
<a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/faiface/beep/mp3">MP3</a> formats. …</p></article></div>

<p>In this blog post, I will introduce user namespaces, explain why they are useful for containers and how they interact with Linux capabilities and filesystems. Then, I will explain the work we’ve done on two user namespace projects with Netflix: adding unprivileged user namespace support to FUSE and current work we’re doing to enable user namespaces in Kubernetes.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-user-namespaces">What are user namespaces?</h2>
<p>Containers on Linux are not a first-class concept, instead they are built upon namespaces, cgroups and other Linux primitives. The Linux API offers different kinds of namespaces and they each isolate a specific aspect of the operating system. For example, two containers in different network namespaces will not see each other’s network interfaces. Two containers in different PID namespaces will not see each other’s processes.</p>
<p>


<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank">User namespaces</a>
 are similar: they isolate user IDs and group IDs from each other. On Linux, all files and all processes are owned by a specific user id and group id, usually defined in /etc/passwd and /etc/group. A user namespace can be configured to let a container only see a subset of the host’s user IDs and group IDs.</p>
<p>In the example below, the two containers are configured to use distinct sets of user IDs, offering more isolation between themselves and between the containers and the host. Processes and files in <em>container 1</em> of the example might have the illusion of being <code>root</code> (user id 0), but are in fact using user id 100000 on the host.
</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-12-userns/image1.png" alt="2 containers as 2 different UIDs"></p>
<h3 id="user-namespaces-and-capabilities">User namespaces and capabilities</h3>
<p>This possibility to appear as user “<code>root</code>” in the container but, in fact, be another user is an important feature of user namespaces. To go in more details about this, let me first sum up the history of this feature in the Linux kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before Linux 2.2, there was one user, “<code>root</code>” with user id 0, who could do privileged operations like configuring the network and mounting new filesystems. Regular users couldn’t do those privileged operations.</li>
<li>Since Linux 2.2, the privileges from the “root” user are split into different 


<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html" target="_blank">capabilities</a>
, e.g. <code>CAP_NET_ADMIN</code> to configure the network and <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> to mount a new filesystem.</li>
<li>Linux 3.8 introduced user namespaces in 2013 and, with it, capabilities are no longer global but interpreted in the context of a user namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example of what that means, we’ll consider the scenario where a container executes the program “<code>sshfs</code>” to mount a ssh filesystem using fuse. Mounting a filesystem requires the capability <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code>. This is not something normally granted to containers as it would give them too much power and defeats the purpose of isolation between the host and container.</p>
<p>When a container is set up without a new user namespace, the only way to allow it to execute “<code>sshfs</code>” successfully is to give <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> to it, which is unfortunate due to the negative security implications discussed above—even though “<code>sshfs</code>” does not want to impact the host.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-12-userns/image2.png" alt="PID, Mount Namespace, and Initial User Namespace"></p>
<p>But when the container is using a new user namespace, it can be given <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> in that user namespace without having <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on the host user namespace. Being “root” (user id 0) in the container does not impact the host because the real user id is not root on the host.</p>
<p>More precisely, to mount a filesystem in the mount namespace of the container requires the process to have <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> in the user namespace owning that mount namespace.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-12-userns/image3.png" alt="PID, Mount Namespace, and Unshared User Namesapce, from the Initial User Namespace"></p>
<h3 id="user-namespaces-and-filesystems">User namespaces and filesystems</h3>
<p>From the explanation above, it looks like thanks to user namespaces, it is possible to allow containers to mount filesystems without being root on the host. But depending on the filesystem, there are more pieces that come into play. Linux keeps a list of filesystems deemed safe for mounting in user namespaces, marked with the 


<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/" target="_blank"><code>FS_USERNS_MOUNT</code> flag</a>
. Creating a new mount in a non-initial user namespace is only allowed with those filesystem types. You can find the list in the Linux git repository with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">git grep -nw FS_USERNS_MOUNT
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see in the table below, new filesystem mounts in non-initial user namespaces were initially restricted to only procfs and sysfs, and then more and more filesystems were allowed along the years to be mounted in user namespaces. This is because it takes time to ensure that a filesystem is safe to use by unprivileged users.</p>

<h3 id="impact-on-container-security">Impact on container security</h3>
<p>User namespaces is another layer of security that isolates the host from the container. There has been a series of container vulnerabilities that were mitigated with user namespaces and it would be safe to assume that future vulnerabilities would be mitigated as well.</p>
<p>As an example, there was 


<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/11/2" target="_blank">CVE-2019-5736</a>
 (


<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0a8e4117e7f715d5fbeef398405813ce8e88558b" target="_blank">fix in runc</a>
) where the host runc binary could be overwritten from the container. The announcement of the vulnerability mentions that using user namespaces is one of the possible mitigations.</p>
<p>This is because even though the vulnerability allows a process in the container to have a reference to runc on the host via /proc/self/exe, the runc binary would be owned by a user (<code>root</code>) that is not mapped in the container. The container would perceive runc as belonging to the special user “<code>nobody</code>” and the “<code>root</code>” user in the container would not have write rights on it.</p>
<p>We had a 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/blog/2019/02/runc-breakout-vulnerability-mitigated-on-flatcar-linux/" target="_blank">blog post</a>
 explaining the details of the issue and how Flatcar Container Linux mitigated it in a different way, by using a read-only filesystem for hosting the runc binary. The diagram below shows the sequence of steps used by runc to create a container, and how the /proc/self/exe can be a reference to runc. For more details about how that works, see our

<p>The Kubernetes User Namespaces KEP (


<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2101" target="_blank">KEP/127</a>
) lists a couple of other vulnerabilities that can be mitigated with user namespaces.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-user-namespaces-for-fuse-filesystems">Enabling user namespaces for FUSE filesystems</h2>
<p>Before Linux 4.18, FUSE was not allowed in user namespaces but the effort to make it work was mostly complete: Ubuntu kernels already had a patch set to support it.</p>
<p>The missing part for Linux upstream was proper integration with the integrity subsystem, 


<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/" target="_blank">IMA</a>
 (Integrity Measurement Architecture). On Linux systems that use IMA, the kernel can detect if files are modified before allowing processes to read or execute them. It enables an audit trail of what is executed. It can also enable the Linux Extended Verification Module (EVM) to enforce a policy to only execute programs if their content is known to be good or signed by a trusted encryption key.</p>
<p>As opposed to files stored on a local hard disk with a traditional filesystem, files on filesystems such as FUSE can be modified without the kernel being able to re-measure, re-appraise, and re-audit files before being served.</p>
<p>We wrote a patch on the 


<a href="https://github.com/bbengfort/memfs" target="_blank">memfs FUSE driver</a>
 to demonstrate the following problem in this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the first request, the FUSE driver serves a file with its initial content.</li>
<li>IMA provides a measurement of the file.</li>
<li>On the second request, the FUSE driver serves the same file with an altered content.</li>
<li>IMA does not measure the content again so the altered content is not measured.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, there was a patch in discussion attempting to fix the issue with a “<code>force</code>” option in IMA that would force IMA to always re-measure, re-appraise, and re-audit files based on a policy, for example all files served by FUSE. We 


<a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-integrity&amp;m=151559360514676&amp;w=2" target="_blank">tested</a>
 the effectiveness of that patch.</p>
<p>We sent several patch sets to explore different options.</p>
<p>The first option explored was to 


<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/872436/" target="_blank">patch</a>
 IMA so that it recognises FUSE filesystems as special and use the “<code>force</code>” option on them, so the measurements are performed for each request, even if the kernel didn’t detect any changes. We received the review that the IMA subsystem should not have to know the different filesystems in order to behave differently in the case of FUSE. Indeed, other filesystems could have the same issue such as remote filesystems. With this option, IMA needs to know about the behaviour of all filesystems, and it is putting this knowledge at the wrong layer.</p>
<p>In order to solve this, the second option explored was to 


<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1598387.html" target="_blank">introduce a new filesystem flag <code>FS_NO_IMA_CACHE</code></a>
 (


<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1587390.html" target="_blank">v1</a>
, 


<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1587678.html" target="_blank">v2</a>
,

, 


<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1598387.html" target="_blank">v4</a>
) that allows filesystems to announce to the IMA subsystem their own behaviour with regard to caching. The IMA subsystem can then check the flag and use the “<code>force</code>” option if the flag is present. In that way, the IMA subsystem does not need to know about the different filesystems.</p>
<p>However, the IMA “<code>force</code>” option does not solve all the issues and signatures still can’t be verified meaningfully. In the end, the following 


<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/1521999985.3541.32.camel@linux.vnet.ibm.com/" target="_blank">solution</a>
 was implemented in Linux 4.17 by IMA maintainers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new flag <code>SB_I_IMA_UNVERIFIABLE_SIGNATURE</code> that filesystems can use to announce to IMA that their signatures cannot be verified.<br>
Right now, only FUSE filesystems make use of this flag. For more security, IMA users can use the IMA policy “fail_securely” that makes IMA signature verification on FUSE filesystems fail even without a user namespace.</li>
<li>Add another new flag <code>SB_I_UNTRUSTED_MOUNTER</code> that filesystems can use when  they are mounted from a user namespace that cannot be trusted. In that case, the IMA measurement would fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this IMA fix in Linux 4.17, FUSE filesystems in a non-initial user namespace are

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>The idea of dynamic <em>symbolic execution</em> is to execute a piece of software on any input.
All possible execution paths are explored simultaneously without specifying concrete values.
Consider the following example where the input <code>x</code> is unknown, i.e., symbolic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...
</span><span></span><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>assert</span><span>(</span><span>"should not reach this!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Symbolic execution runs this code on all three <em>execution paths</em> (<code>x&lt;0</code>, <code>x&gt;100</code>, <code>0&lt;=x&lt;=100</code>) and generates three concrete test cases: <code>x=-1</code>, <code>x=101</code> and <code>x=23</code> after hitting the assertion.</p>
<p>You don’t need to write test cases manually anymore.
You catch assertion failures and memory safety errors along the execution paths.
Ok, that is all in theory, but can this approach work for real-world programs in practice?</p>
<h3 id="klee">KLEE</h3>
<p><a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> is a symbolic execution engine that executes unmodified, real-world programs on any input.
You compile your program to <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> bitcode, mark some inputs as symbolic, and start KLEE.
KLEE explores possible execution paths using constraint solving and generates concrete test cases for each of them.
In case of a bug, you can replay your program with the input that triggered it.</p>
<p>In November 2019, the seminal <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/2008-12-OSDI-KLEE.html">OSDI 2008 paper</a> on KLEE <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193808/paper-co-authored-professor-cadar-elected-acm/">has been elected to ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame</a>.
Over the past decade, the research and application of KLEE resulted in over 150 scientific publications, dozens of Ph.D. theses, research grants, tools, and security startups.
On my behalf, I spent more than five years of my life with KLEE as well and learned a lot along the way.</p>
<h3 id="testing-network-protocols-using-klee">Testing Network Protocols Using KLEE</h3>
<p>In 2007, I struggled to find my research thesis until I came across Cristian Cadar’s paper <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cristic/talks/exe-ccs-2006.pdf">“EXE: Automatically Generating Inputs of Death”</a>.
Inspired by the idea of symbolic execution, I asked myself the following question: <em>Can I mark the protocol header of an incoming network packet symbolic before passing it to the network stack?
If so, can I find protocol specification and implementation bugs with this technique?</em></p>
<p>I wrote an e-mail to Cristian Cadar and promptly received an answer.
Moreover, Cristian and Daniel Dunbar generously sent me the source code of KLEE, a new tool they were working on, even before its official release to the public.</p>
<p>In the following five years of my Ph.D. journey, I extended KLEE to execute several protocol stacks that talk to each other.
I applied this technique to test sensor networks and found a couple of interesting bugs in the Contiki OS described in my <a href="http://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2010/2010-04-ipsn-sasnauskas-KleeNet.pdf">IPSN 2010 paper</a>.
One of them caused a dead-lock of a sensor node inside the TCP/IP stack requiring a hardware reset.
It was a real bug observed in sensor network deployments.</p>
<p>I have not used KLEE actively since 2015 and was curious to give it a try (again).
Meanwhile, Contiki OS has been forked to <a href="https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng">Contiki-NG</a>.
I cloned the repo and compiled the test case called <code>20-packet-parsing</code> to LLVM bitcode.
Inside the test case, I marked the test packet buffer (~1KB) symbolic using KLEE’s <code>klee_make_symbolic</code> function.</p>
<p>After running for a couple of minutes on my old Mac, KLEE discovered two memory errors (out of bound pointers) while parsing certain protocols' headers.
I reported these findings with the concrete test cases to the security team of Contiki-NG for further analysis.
To me, this small test is yet another evidence that KLEE remains to be a useful research and test case generation tool.</p>
<h3 id="open-challenges-and-opportunities">Open Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
<p>Applying symbolic execution to arbitrary real-world programs is hard.
You often have to model the execution environment and find effective ways to cope with non-determinism and path explosion.
Moreover, many of the path constraints are difficult yet intractable to be solved in time with today’s solvers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, studying and applying symbolic execution (using KLEE) opens many opportunities.
You will learn about program structure, compilers, SAT/SMT solvers, and how to write other kinds of testing tools.
Given this bag of knowledge, I wrote tools to <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/p1-sasnauskas.pdf">fuzz Android apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/souper">superoptimize LLVM IR</a>, and more recently at work, a tool to <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2018-2665">fuzz satellite control procedures</a> written in SPELL.</p>
<p>Consider giving symbolic execution a try.

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.22%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (40.7%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (59%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.0001%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.015%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (28.8%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (62.5%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (8.6%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For linked resources, HTTP 3 is about 100x more prevalent. How can this be true? Because all the sites are linking the same stuff:</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        
        <p id="full-di-expand"><a onclick="expandDi()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>main_doc_is_http2_or_greater (-477.53)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>jsheapusedsize_Kb (-0.02)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>jseventlisteners (0.01)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>redirect_count (354.27)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

					<p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to thousands of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p><p>“Umm...that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p><p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p><p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p><p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out?</p><p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p><p>For some reason no one talks about these aspects of interviewing, but I’ve found them helpful time and time again.</p><p>We’ll cover:</p><ul><li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li><li>Going to real interviews for practice</li><li>Being open to learning during interviews</li><li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li></ul><h2 id="tip-1-use-recruiters-to-your-advantage">Tip #1: Use recruiters to your advantage</h2><p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p><p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p><p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you've already passed that bar</p><p>Now the recruiter wants to work <em>with</em> you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and are happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard strong candidates who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p><p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p><p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p><ul><li>“What should I do to prepare for the interview?”</li><li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li></ul><p>And be forthright about any problems you run into:</p><ul><li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you're at your best!</li><li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they'll say "sorry, we can't do that". It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li></ul><p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p><h2 id="tip-2-go-to-real-interviews-for-practice">Tip #2: Go to real interviews for practice</h2><p>You need to build up your interviewing skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don't limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p><p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p><p>When you're in a real interview the world changes: You're locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing against the walls. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous "Would you like something to drink?" is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p><p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you'll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You'll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p><p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn't look so fierce. I've found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don't care about the outcome. I'm much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don't really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p><p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p><p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on the behavioral and design ones which have no clear right answer. Consider how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p><p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you'll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you'll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture highlighting how your abilities make you a valuable asset to the company.</p><p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p><p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t find the company interesting. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they suggest.</p><p>And I did. More than once.</p><h2 id="tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">Tip #3: Be open to learning during the interview</h2><p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p><p>In a college career fair once I was walking through the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I'd never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn't just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik's cube in hand. That evening I got a call from Vince offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought "Sure, why not? I could use the experience"</p><p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I'd ask "I don't think I did so great here. What's the right answer to this problem?" (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When I was asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p><p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company's name: Bloomberg</p><p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p><p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p><h2 id="tip-4-keep-your-skills-sharp-even-when-you-re-not-job-hunting">Tip #4: Keep your skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p><p>It's an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you'll be able to find another one quickly. That's a huge stress off your back.</p><p>I haven't been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I'll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don't bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p><p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudocode written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don't have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like "create an array" tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what's my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p><p>What hadn't occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p><p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And now I work there.

      <pre>				    mkproof

mkproof is a small C program for generating proofs of work.

				  Installation

If mkproof is available as a package on your system, prefer to install that
rather than build it yourself.

mkproof depends only on a POSIX-like environment and a C99 compiler.

	$ ./configure
	$ make

This will produce three executables: mkchallenge, mkproof, and checkproof.

				     Usage

The situation: Bob wants Alice to do something, but Alice isn't sure if Bob is a
robot.

1. Alice runs `mkchallenge` and sends the challenge to Bob.
2. Bob runs `mkproof &lt;challenge&gt;` and wastes some CPU time. After several
   minutes of work, a proof is printed to stdout.
3. Bob sends the proof to Alice.
4. Alice runs `checkproof &lt;challenge&gt; &lt;proof&gt;` to verify the work.

Now Alice can be reasonably confident that Bob is not a robot, and proceed with
Bob's request.

				   Algorithm

To make a challenge, generate 16 random bytes. Choose the argon2 iterations and
memory parameters, and the number of zeroed digits, to tune the difficulty. The
challenge string is the terms "argon2id"; the iterations, memory use, and number
of digits which shall be zero, as decimal integers; and the random bytes as
hexadecimal; joining the terms with ":".

To make a proof, split the challenge by ":" and verify that the first token is
"argon2id". Decode the iterations, memory, and digits parameters, and the
challenge bytes.

Repeat the following algorithm to generate proofs until an argon2id key
is found whose first N bits are zero, where N is equal to the digits
parameter:

1. Generate 16 random bytes (password).
2. Run argon2id with the generated password, and the memory and iteration
   parameters provided by the challenge, and the challenge bytes as the salt.
   The hash length and parallelism parameters shall be respectively set to 32
   and 1.
3. Encode the argon2id hash as hexadecimal.

When a suitable hash is found, encode the password in hexadecimal. This is the
proof which should be transmitted to the challenger.

To verify the proof, simply run the proof algorithm with the original challenge
parameters and the challengee's provided password and verify that the resulting
hexadecimal string is prefixed with the appropriate number of zeroes.

				     Notes

The defaults are tuned to take about five minutes on one core of a modern
consumer CPU.

<p>In January 2020, I spent a week in Ethiopia with a team of medical professionals from <a href="https://www.cityreformed.org/" target="_blank">my church</a> and a sister church in Boston. It was an amazing week, and the environment was quite different from my “normal” in the States. On the return trip, as the plane was descending into Pittsburgh, I was shocked to see residential neighborhoods with large, beautiful houses, after a week of houses being very small and made of corrugated metal.</p>

<p>Anyway, our team was there to run a clinic. I had been told I might be able to work on a tech project, but had pretty low expectations. This post is about how that did, in fact, materialize.</p>



<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><img src="https://alexcwatt.com/assets/2020/12/ethiopia-act-logo.png" alt="Ethiopia ACT logo"></p>

<p><a href="https://ethiopiaact.org/" target="_blank">Ethiopia ACT</a> serves the sick and poor in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Addis+Ababa,+Ethiopia/" target="_blank">Addis Ababa</a>. It was started in 2002, at the height of the HIV crisis. Today their ministry still helps with HIV/AIDS, but has expanded to include other social care as well: For instance, they have met the financial needs of hundreds of families and have helped hundreds of families become self-sufficient. When I met the founder, Andy Warren, I was impressed by the data-driven decision-making approach he champions. He told me that <em>measurable impact</em> is one of their ministry values.</p>

<p>Because data is so important to their ministry, Ethiopia ACT runs a database server in their main office with records for families. One of their staff members, Danny, does most of the database administration, and he had asked our team to work with him to enable social workers to collect data in the field with donated Android phones and sync that data to the database. Previously the social workers were using paper forms. So Bill, a Pittsburgh colleague, and I got to work thinking about how to make this possible.</p>

<p>The initial vision was simple enough: Capture the patient ID, a couple metrics related to HIV/AIDS, and the date. As I understood the problem domain better and sketched a solution, I suggested other changes to their data model to get more value from the work we were doing. I convinced Danny that in addition to tracking HIV metrics over time, we could get even more value by having a table of visits. Working together, we came up with the following additional fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date of visit</li>
  <li>Social worker</li>
  <li>Location (both latitude and longitude, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What3words" target="_blank">What3Words</a> address)</li>
  <li>Follow-up actions required</li>
  <li>Notes on the visit</li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, the project has expanded to capture additional data, but this illustrates some of the work in improving the data model.</p>

<p>One key detail I didn’t realize on my first day, that became apparent throughout the week: Supporting offline use would be critical. The electric and Internet infrastructure in Ethiopia is extremely unreliable, so a good solution would need to not only allow data to be collected offline, but also support the database server being offline frequently.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-tech">About the Tech</h2>

<p>Ethiopia ACT uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker" target="_blank">FileMaker</a> to run its database. Bill and I were unfamiliar with it, and briefly considered other options, as I wondered if we could find something open source that would be more robust and easier to integrate, but the ease of maintaining FileMaker by their staff and of creating UI’s to manipulate the data would be hard to replicate. We decided to leave it.</p>

<p>Ethiopia ACT also uses <a href="https://www.fulcrumapp.com/" target="_blank">Fulcrum</a> to gather data from the field. With Fulcrum, anyone can make a survey form, and push it to mobile devices. The app works great offline and can sync data to Fulcrum’s servers when it comes back online. This worked great for some projects, but for the data they track in FileMaker, there was no obvious way to connect the two systems.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-how">Exploring the “How”</h2>

<p>After a couple days of investigating, we not only decided to stick with FileMaker, but also decided that Fulcrum was probably the best option (or a good-enough option) for the mobile data collection. I did spend a hot minute tinkering with <a href="https://expo.io/" target="_blank">Expo</a>, but that wouldn’t have supported easy maintenance. (Frontend friends: If you think running <code>npm install</code> is awful over high-speed Internet, you should really try it in Africa sometime. 😃)</p>

<p>Thus the high-level plan became:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Fulcrum’s <a href="https://docs.fulcrumapp.com/docs/webhooks" target="_blank">webhooks</a> feature to watch for form submissions</li>
  <li>Use FileMaker’s <a href="https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/docs/18/en/dataapi/" target="_blank">REST API</a> to add the data</li>
</ul>

<p>With that plan, we decided to try integrating with FileMaker first: There were more moving pieces with that – authentication, pushing to multiple tables, figuring out how to even enable the API (we had to upgrade FileMaker to get support for it), etc.</p>

<p>For the FileMaker integration, I looked at two libraries primarily: <a href="https://github.com/davidhamann/python-fmrest" target="_blank">fmrest</a> (Python) and <a href="https://github.com/Luidog/fms-api-client" target="_blank">fms-api-client</a> (JavaScript). Although I’m better at Python, the JavaScript package was much better documented, so I decided to go with it. It took a few tries to understand the API, but overall a proof-of-concept of pushing dummy data into the server was pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="final-architecture">Final Architecture</h2>

<p>Here’s the data flow we landed on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data is collected in a Fulcrum form.</li>
  <li>Once the data is submitted, it triggers a webhook that pushes the data to a Google Cloud Function.</li>
  <li>The Google Cloud Function transforms the data and saves it in Firestore. Running this Cloud Function would be basically free, but we decided to also integrate with <a href="https://developer.what3words.com/" target="_blank">What3Words</a> to take the latitude and longitude of the form submission and look up the “address” of the beneficiary.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> So the Cloud Function uses <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access" target="_blank">VPC access</a> to talk to the What3Words API.</li>
  <li>A script is run on the database server to pull data from Firestore and push it into Fulcrum. It processes one document at a time, and pushes the data into FileMaker, deleting documents as they are successfully processed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tech-stack-summary">Tech Stack Summary:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Google Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Function, Firebase, and Serverless VPC.</li>
  <li>Languages and Frameworks: Node.js for both the Google Cloud Function and the database server script, with Jest for unit testing, and fms-api-client to talk to FileMaker.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="battle-scars">Battle Scars</h2>

<p>Every tech project has at least a few foibles. Some of the ones we encountered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FileMaker doesn’t have a programmatic way to manage migrations. Migrations are literally just someone changing the columns through a UI. Between some cleanup I wanted to do (spelling standardization, for instance) and the changes needed for the project, we had quite a list, and no simple way to test it all, although we could (and did) make copies of the database file. Shout-out to Bill for managing this part of the project! 🙏</li>
  <li>I thought it might be a good idea to try running a reverse SSH proxy from the database server to a cloud server, and let the Fulcrum webhook push data directly through to the database server. I wanted to try it because it would have made the overall integration easier, but it proved infeasible with the Internet reliability issues, and I also knew it would be better to have a data queue in the cloud that we could pull from when we were online.</li>
  <li>Setting up CI/CD – the Cloud Function deploys, the test runners, it all takes a few tries – but that’s normal.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Setting up Bitbucket CI/CD for a side project, as seen by commit history:</p><p>- Start on Pipeline<br>- Continue working on deploy strategy [skip ci]<br>- Overhaul Pipeline build<br>- Fix pipeline<br>- Enable Docker for second step</p><p>... and it's probably not over yet.</p></div>— Alex Watt (@acwatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/acwatt/status/1341063091170230272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="some-wins">Some Wins</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/" target="_blank">GitLab CI/CD</a>: Having nearly 100% test coverage, and an automated test and deployment pipeline, was a big win overall. Danny has been able to make changes to the code with greater confidence, and has been able to write tests for new features modeled on the existing tests.</li>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share" target="_blank">VS Code’s Live Share</a> is fantastic for collaboration. The audio quality was better than WhatsApp, and once we got setup, Danny and I were able to pair program like we were sitting next to each other, despite being 7000 miles apart.</li>
  <li>Google Cloud’s Firestore is a simple document database, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/firestore" target="_blank">Node SDK</a> is a breeze. I was glad for the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/transactions" target="_blank">transaction support</a> because as part of the data modeling, I decided to have the incoming Fulcrum records split into multiple documents in Firestore – basically one per object. I wanted to write all of these documents together, or none at all, and transactions enabled that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>What I thought would be a small project actually became a pretty mature software project. I needed some additional time after getting back to polish it, and since then Danny has also wanted to extend it to handle more fields. I’ve been mostly hands-off for this – I review his code, and we’ve had lots of conversations about programming, version control, testing, etc., but he has been the one making the changes.</p>

<p>As I think about the impact, I am really excited that Ethiopia ACT can use this project to better serve hundreds of families in Addis Ababa. It’s also been very exciting to see the skills Danny has developed from continuing on this project (e.g., Git, VS Code, Node.js, etc.) and to get to continue to work with him, including our occasional early morning calls over the past year (early morning in Pittsburgh is afternoon in Africa).</p>

<p>Danny also told me that this project has made the field workers more connected with the administrators and managers, which was encouraging to hear. I look forward to seeing how the Lord uses this in 2021 and beyond!</p>

<p>In the long tradition of writing a “Hello World!” program to learn a new language, I decided to title this post about writing a program in (and for) Africa, “Hello Africa!”</p>

  <p>One Hundred Sixteen Billion: that’s the number of times our test code read Firestore database in less than an hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post is Part 2 in the series. If you haven’t already, go through <strong><a href="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/">Part 1</a></strong> first so this one makes sense :)</p>

<h3 id="standing-himalaya-is-telling-us">Standing Himalaya is telling us…</h3>
<p>This was the first time that I had received such a big set back. It had the potential to alter the course of our company and my life. There were several lessons on entrepreneurship in this incident, one important one was to stay strong.</p>

<p>I had a team of ~7 engineers/interns at this time, and it would take Google about 10 days to get back to us on this incident. In the meantime we had to resume development, find our way around account suspensions. Despite this thought on my mind, we had to focus on the features and our product.</p>

<em>Poem: Khada Himalaya bata raha hai (Standing Himalaya is telling us)
</em></a>
</center>

<p>For some reason one poem from my childhood kept playing in my head. It was my favorite one, and I remembered it word to word, even though the last time I recited it was over 15 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-we-actually-do">What did we actually do?</h3>
<p>As a very small team, we wanted to stay serverless for as long as we could. The problem with serverless solutions like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run was timeout.</p>

<p>One instance at any time would be serially scraping the URLs in a web page. But soon after 9 minutes, it would time out.</p>

<p>After discussing this problem, and powered with caffiene, within minutes I wrote some dry code on the white board which I now see had so many design issues, but back then, we were focused more on failing and learning super fast and trying new things.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/whiteboard.jpg" width="100%"><br>
<em>Announce-AI's 'Hello World' version on Cloud Run</em>
</center>

<p>To overcome the timeout limitation, I suggested using POST requests (with URL as data) to send jobs to an instance, and use multiple instances in parallel instead of using one instance serially. Because each instance in Cloud Run would only be scraping one page, it would never time out, process all pages in parallel (scale), and also be highly optimized because Cloud Run usage is accurate to milliseconds.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/flowchart.jpg" width="100%"><br>
<em>Scraper deployed on Cloud Run</em>
</center>

<p>If you look closely, the flow is missing few important pieces.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Exponential Recursion without Break: The instances wouldn’t know when to break, as there was no break statement.</li>
  <li>The POST requests could be of the same URLs. If there’s a back link to the previous page, the Cloud Run service will be stuck in infinite recursion, but what’s worst is, that this recursion is multiplying exponentially (our max instances were set to 1000!)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can imagine, this lead to 1000 instances querying, and writing to Firebase DB every few milli seconds. Looking at the data post incident, we saw that the Firebase Reads were at one point about 1 Billion Requests per minute!</p>

<em>End of month Transaction Summary for GCP Billing Account</em>
</center>

<h3 id="116-billion-reads-and-33-million-writes">116 Billion Reads and 33 Million Writes</h3>
<p>Running our this version of Hello World deployment on Cloud Run, made 116 Billion reads and 33 Million Writes to Firestore. Ouch!</p>

<p>Read Operations Cost on Firebase:</p>

<p><strong>$ (0.06 / 100,000) * 116,000,000,000 = $ 69,600</strong></p>

<h3 id="16000-hours-of-cloud-run-compute-time">16,000 hours of Cloud Run Compute time</h3>
<p>After testing, we assumed that the request died because logging stopped, but actually it went into background process. As we didn’t delete the services (this was our first time using Cloud Run, and we didn’t really understand it back then), multiple services continued to operate slowly.</p>

<p>In 24 hours, these service versions each scaled to 1000 instances consumed <strong>16,022 hours.</strong></p>

<h2 id="all-our-mistakes">All our Mistakes</h2>
<h4 id="deploying-flawed-algorithm-on-cloud">Deploying flawed algorithm on Cloud</h4>
<p>Already discussed above. We did discover a new way to use serverless using POST requests, something I hadn’t found anywhere on the internet, but deployed it without refining the algorithm.</p>

<h4 id="deploying-cloud-run-with-default-options">Deploying Cloud Run with Default Options</h4>
<p>While creating a Cloud Run service, we chose default values in the service. The max-instances is preset to 1000, and concurrency set to 80. In the beginning we didn’t know that these values are actually worst case scenario for a test program.</p>

<p>Had we chosen max-instances to be “2”, our costs would’ve been 500 times less. <strong>$72,000 bill would’ve been: $144</strong></p>

<p>Had we chosen concurrency of “1” request, we probably wouldn’t have even noticed the bill.</p>

<h4 id="using-firebase-without-understanding-it-completely">Using Firebase without understanding it completely</h4>
<p>There are somethings that can only be learnt after lot of experience. Firebase isn’t a language that one can learn, it’s a containerized platform service provided by Google. It has rules defined by them, not by laws of nature or how a particular user may think they are.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/firebase.png" width="60%">
</center>

<p>Also, while writing code in Node.js, one must take care of Background processes. If the code goes into background processes, there’s no easy way for the developer to know that the service is running, but it might be, for fairly long time. As we learnt later on, this was the reason why most of our Cloud Functions were timing out as well.</p>

<h4 id="fail-fast-learn-fast-with-cloud-is-a-bad-idea">Fail fast, learn fast with Cloud is a bad idea</h4>
<p>Cloud overall is like a double edged sword. When used properly, it can be of great use, but if used incorrectly, it can have consequences.</p>

<p>If you count the number of pages in GCP documentation, it’s probably more than pages in few novels. Understanding Pricing, Usage, is not only time consuming, but requires a deep understanding of how Cloud services work. No wonder there are full time jobs for just this purpose!</p>

<h4 id="firebase-and-cloud-run-are-really-powerful">Firebase, and Cloud Run are really powerful</h4>
<p>At the peak, Firebase was able to handle about one billion reads per minute. This is exceptionally powerful. We had been playing around with Firebase for 2-3 months now and still learning about it, but I had absolutely no idea how powerful it was until now.</p>

<p>Same goes with Cloud Run! With Concurrency == 60, max_containers == 1000 and each Request taking 400ms, number of requests Cloud Run can handle <strong>9 million requests per minute!</strong></p>

<h4 id="60--1000--25--60--9000000-requests--minute">60 * 1000 * 2.5 * 60 = 9,000,000 requests / minute</h4>

<p>For comparison, Google Search gets 3.8 million searches per minute.</p>

<h4 id="edit-use-cloud-monitoring">(EDIT): Use Cloud Monitoring</h4>
<p>While <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring">Google Cloud Monitoring</a> doesn’t stop the billing, it does send timely alerts (lag of about 3-4 minutes). There’s a learning curve in understanding Google Cloud’s proto / naming structure, but once you spend time with it, the dashboards, alerts and metrics make the life a little easier.</p>

<p>These metrics are only availabe for 90 days, and we’ve lost the metrics from this incident (there was a huge bump in Firebase and Cloud Run usage for those days), otherwise I’d be happy to share them in this post.</p>

<h2 id="we-survived">We Survived</h2>

<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/phew.gif" width="100%">
<em>Phew, that was close</em>
</center>

<p>After going through our lengthy doc on this incident sharing our side of the story, various consults, talks, and internal discussions Google let go of our bill as a one time gesture!</p>

<p><strong>Thank you Google!</strong></p>

<p>We got our lifeline, and got back on both our feet to build Announce. Except this time with a much better perspective, architecture, and much safer implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google, my favorite tech company, is not just a great company to work for. It’s also a great company to collaborate with. The tools provided by Google are very developer friendly, have a great documentation (for the most part), and are consistently expanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(EDIT: these are my - the author’s personal opinions as an individual developer. Our company is in no way sponsored, or related with Google).</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>
<p>After this incident, we spent few months on understanding Cloud and our architecture. In few weeks my understanding improved so much that I approximated the cost of scraping the “entire web” using Cloud Run with improved algorithm.</p>

<p>This incident led me to analyze our product’s architecture in depth, and we scrapped V1 of our product, to build scalable infrastructure to power our products.</p>

<p>In Announce V2, we didn’t just build an MVP; we built a platform where we could iteratively develop new products rapidly, and test them thoroughly in a safe environment.</p>

<p>This journey took us some time… <a href="https://annc.in/">Announce</a> was launched in November end, ~7 months later than we had decided for our V1, but it is highly scalable, gets the best of Cloud services, and is highly optimized for usage.</p>

<p>We also launched on all platforms, and not just web.</p>

<p>What’s more is that we reused the entire platform to build our second product <a href="https://pointaddress.com/">Point Address</a>. Not only are both the products scalable, have a great architecture, and highly efficient, they are built on a platform that allows us to rapidly build and deploy ideas into useable products.</p>

I read some of his work, including his <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2015/11/barrister-criticises-post-office.html" target="_blank">clear view of where the court was wrong</a> in the prosecution of Seema Misra, the West Byfleet Postmaster sent to prison whilst pregnant.</p><p>Mr Mason's central argument is that a recommendation given by the Law Commission in 1997 to the courts is helplesssly, hopelessly and dangerously wrong. <a href="https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5143/5027" target="_blank">The guidance states</a>:</p><blockquote>"in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the courts will presume that&nbsp;mechanical instruments were in order at the material time...&nbsp;<i>The principle has been applied to such devices as speedometers and traffic lights and in the consultation paper we saw no reason why it should not apply to computers.</i>" [my italics]</blockquote><p>You don't need to be a legal eagle or IT genius to see that the Law Commission's decision to leap from a speedometer to the vastly complex digital ecosystems underpinning modern computer networks is mutton-headed, to say the least.</p><p>Yet it is this presumption the courts have relied on throughout the 21st century in the prosecutions of Subpostmasters and unfortunate individuals in other spheres, who were, it turns out, entirely innocent.</p><p>Mr Mason has been attempting to get the legal position on computers changed for as long as I can remember. Now he has a document which might force the issue - the <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2019/3408.html" target="_blank">Horizon Issues judgment</a>, handed down on 16 Dec 2019.</p><p>On the anniversary of the judgment, Mr Mason, along with the barrister Paul Marshall and eight other learned authors, published a paper positing alternatives to the way digital evidence is currently handled in the courts.</p><p>It is called: "<a href="https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5240/5083" target="_blank">Recommendations for the probity of computer evidence</a>" and it states:</p><blockquote>"All computers have a propensity to fail, possibly seriously. That is to say, they have a latent propensity to function incorrectly."</blockquote><p>As a general rule of thumb:</p><blockquote>"A program on a mobile telephone might hitherto have contained tens of thousands of lines of software code. A program such as Horizon will contain tens of millions of lines of code, and will be exceedingly complex. Programming is a human task and programmers make mistakes; an error rate in writing software code of 10 errors per thousand lines of code&nbsp;is considered good, 1 error per thousand lines is rarely if ever achieved."</blockquote><p>By way of example the paper cites a 2006 University of York review of a study conducted by the Ministry of Defence into the safety of the software contained in its Hercules C130J air transporters. The MoD found that the Hercules software contained about 1.4 safety-critical faults per thousand lines of code (kLoC) with an overall flaw density of around 23 per kLoC</p><p>The review notes:</p><blockquote>"whilst a fault density of 1 per kLoC may seem high it is worth noting that commercial software is around 30 faults per kLoC, with initial fault injection rates of over 100 per kLoC."</blockquote><p>Mr Mason et al's clear recommendations for a protocol on the way electronic evidence is treated by the legal system&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/view/5240/5083" target="_blank">can be read here</a>.

<p><strong>In cell culture,
loperamide, a drug commonly used against diarrhoea, proves effective against
glioblastoma cells. A research team at Goethe University has now unravelled the
drug’s mechanisms &nbsp;of action of cell
death induction and – in doing so – has shown how this compound could help attack
brain tumours that otherwise are difficult to treat.</strong></p>



<p>The research group led by Dr Sjoerd van Wijk from the Institute of Experimental Cancer Research in Paediatrics at Goethe University already two years ago found evidence indicating that the anti-diarrhoea drug loperamide could be used to induce cell death in glioblastoma cell lines. They have now deciphered its mechanism of action and, in doing so, are opening new avenues for the development of novel treatment strategies.</p>







<h3><strong>When cells digest themselves</strong></h3>



<p>In certain types of tumour cells, administration
of loperamide leads to a stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the
cell organelle responsible for key steps in protein synthesis in the body. The
stress in the ER triggers its degradation, followed by self-destruction of the
cells. This mechanism, known as autophagy-dependent cell death occurs when
cells undergo hyperactivated autophagy. Normally, autophagy regulates normal
metabolic processes and breaks down and recycles the valuable parts of damaged
or superfluous cell components thus ensuring the cell’s survival, for example
in the case of nutrient deficiency. In certain tumour cells, however, hyperactivation
of autophagy destroys so much cell material that they are no longer capable of
surviving.</p>



<p>“Our experiments with cell lines show that
autophagy could support the treatment of glioblastoma brain tumours,” says van
Wijk. Glioblastoma is a very aggressive and lethal type of cancer in children
and adults that shows only a poor response to chemotherapy. New therapeutic
approaches are therefore urgently required. The research group led by van Wijk
has now identified an important factor that links the ER stress response with
the degradation of the ER (reticulophagy):&nbsp;
The “Activating Transcription Factor” ATF4 is
produced in increased amounts both during ER stress and under the influence of
loperamide. It triggers the destruction of the ER membranes and thus of the ER.</p>







<h3><strong>Anti-diarrhoea drug
triggers cell death in glioblastoma cells</strong></h3>



<p>“Conversely, if we block ATF4, far fewer
cells in a tumour cell culture die after adding loperamide,” says van Wijk,
describing the control results. In addition, the research group was able to detect
ER debris in loperamide-treated cells under the electron microscope. “ER
degradation, that is, reticulophagy, visibly contributes to the demise of
glioblastoma cells,” says van Wijk. The team also showed that loperamide triggers
only autophagy but not cell death in other cells, such as embryonic mouse
fibroblasts. “Normally, loperamide, when taken as a remedy against diarrhoea,
binds to particular binding sites in the intestine and is not taken up by the
bowel and is therefore harmless”.</p>







<h3><strong>Mechanism of action
also applicable to other diseases</strong></h3>



<p>The loperamide-induced death of
glioblastoma cells could help in the development of new therapeutic approaches
for the treatment of this severe form of cancer. “However, our findings also
open up exciting new possibilities for the treatment of other diseases where ER
degradation is disrupted, such as neurological disorders or dementia as well as
other types of tumour,” says van Wijk. However, further studies are necessary before
loperamide can actually be used in the treatment of glioblastoma or other
diseases. In future studies it has to be explored, for example, how loperamide
can be transported into the brain and cross the blood-brain barrier.
Nanoparticles might be a feasible option. The research team in Frankfurt now wants
to identify other substances that trigger reticulophagy and examine how the
effect of loperamide can be increased and better understood.</p>



<p>The research group led by Sjoerd van Wijk
is funded by the Frankfurt Foundation for Children with Cancer (<em>Frankfurter
Stiftung für krebskranke Kinder</em>) and the Collaborative Research Centre 1177
“Molecular and Functional Characterisation of Selective Autophagy” funded by
the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). The work is
the result of collaboration with Dr Muriel Mari and Professor Fulvio Reggiori
(University of Groningen, The Netherlands) and Professor Donat Kögel
(Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University).</p>

However, the basic authentication setup for the <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">checkout action</a> involves using one SSH key, effectively a personal access token, for both the <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/116#issuecomment-708092052">main project and all submodules</a>. This is untenable for anyone working with a team.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>The fix, as it were, is in two steps.

						<p>In a research summary posted on <a href="https://theconversation.com/ancient-earth-had-a-thick-toxic-atmosphere-like-venus-until-it-cooled-off-and-became-liveable-150934">The Conversation</a>, scientists attempted to recreate the chemical equilibrium of the cooling magmatic ocean which covered the planet billions of years ago. </p><p>The Earth arose out of a mechanism in which small objects snap to create larger and larger bodies. Using such a mechanism in the history of the earth would have enveloped our planet in a magmatic ocean; an ocean like this would have leaked into our planet the initial atmosphere, and a sufficient cooling to condense water vapor from the air to form condensed seas of water.</p><p>Venus never cooled down sufficiently to form water oceans. H2O in the atmosphere remained as water vapor and was lent to space steadily but inexorably. Earth became more favorable to life, whilst Venus became more and more inhospitable.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Radar_Globe_of_Venus.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Henrik Hargitai, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure><p>Venus has an incredibly thick atmosphere composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, traced by other gasses, including sulfur dioxide. The atmosphere density of Venus is 93 times that of Earth, while the surface pressure is approximally 92 times that of Earth – a pressure equal to that almost 1 km (5⁄8 mi) deep below the Earth's oceans.</p><p>This atmosphere creates a heavy greenhouse effect in the solar energy system, producing a surface temperature of a minimum of 735 k (462 ° C; 864 ° F) and makes Venus' surface hotter than Mercury's.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Venus-pacific-levelled-gigapixel-scale-4_00x.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Venus-pacific-levelled-gigapixel-scale-4_00x.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Venus-pacific-levelled-gigapixel-scale-4_00x.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Venus-pacific-levelled-gigapixel-scale-4_00x.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Venus-pacific-levelled-gigapixel-scale-4_00x.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>By Brocken Inaglory - File:Venus with reflection.jpg, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5223759">CC BY-SA 3.0</a></figcaption></figure><p>Astronomers have identified a cyclical fluctuation of the absorption of sunlight by the atmosphere. The axial tilting of Venus in minutes also minimizes the variation of a seasonal temperature. Studies suggest the atmosphere of Venus may have been much like the one surrounding earth, billions of years ago. Today, surface conditions are no longer suitable for any earthly life formed before the event. The likelihood of life in the top cloud layers of Venus 50 km (30 mi) up from the surface has been hypothesized, but the surrounding atmosphere is acidic.</p><p>According to the article, The Earth comes into being via a mechanism called the "accretion" in which tiny particles briefly clump together under the pull of gravity to form larger and larger bodies. The collision would have left Earth in a worldwide layer of rock called a "magma ocean" which would have poured into the first atmosphere of Planet hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen.</p><p>"If there's a lot of oxygen, it's bound in a 3:2-ratio to iron," researchers say, "We have multiple mantle samples, some of them carried to the surface by volcanic eruptions."</p><p>The early earth cooled down sufficiently to condense water vapor out of the atmosphere, creating seas of molten water like we have now. That will have left an atmosphere of 97% CO2 and 3% N.</p><p>Venus never cooled down sufficiently to form water oceans. H2O in the atmosphere remained as water vapor and was lent to space steadily but inexorably. On earth the seas have slowly but gradually washed down CO2 from the atmosphere. Earth was made more life-friendly while Venus grew even more inhospitable.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <h4 id="intro">Intro</h4><div><p>This blog post details my first experience of writing F# code. I've been interested in learning F# for about a year now, however never really got round to it as I don't get to use it in my day-job. I even attended a F# Meetup in Coventry, at the start of the year, before 2020 took a nose-dive.</p><p>A few months ago, I got the email that so many had received, GoogleMusic was shutting down and users were advised to migrate over to YouTube music. I have uploaded over 8,000 songs in GoogleMusic, love the minimalist interface and use it almost daily. I was a bit gutted as it's a piece of software I have used for years and years, works great on my Android phone and it just gets the job done.</p><p>I did as I was told and clicked the migrate button, to transfer all the songs to YouTube Music. After the wait, the first impressions weren't great. YouTube Music is terrible, I'm not going to spend the whole post ripping into it, but the separation between music I own (uploaded) and YouTube Content isn't well defined, you go and find a song you want to play, get there and realise it's playing from the YouTube Content database rather than your own copy - so you get some nice ads. Also the whole experience feels half-baked, more-so on the "personal library" side of things. Almost like they're trying to discourage you from uploading your own copies of music, and instead buying/listening from their ad-supported media.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>(I've heard of <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">FunkWhale</a> and have began researching that to see if that'll fit my needs - planning to really give it a go in 2021!)</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><div><p>Anyway, back to how YouTube Music forced me into F#...</p><p>Hating the YouTube Music experience I immediately started looking for ways to download my entire library. I do have the original copies of all my tracks, but they're on an old HDD in the loft of my parent's house - so for now, just wanted something to work with.After GoogleMusic had been retired it's not possible to download all the tracks you had stored.......bummer!</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>However, I stumbled across an article which suggested using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a> to download my music library. Google Takeout is a service where Google will make it easy to download all your data that they've got. How nice of them...!</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><div><p>Right, I started the download of 80GB of music and waited. Opened up the `.zip ` files to find that it's a totally flat file structure, the tidy folder structure the songs sat in was no more. Used to be Artist -&gt; Album -&gt; <em>*tracks*</em>.</p><p>I was seconds away from creating a new C# (netcore) console app and fixing this. Would have taken less than 15 mins and I would have my music all nicely sorted again. Great....but I wouldn't have learned anything and I've been wanting to try F# for a while. So, I gave it a go in F# - took a lot longer than 15 mins, maybe a few hours, on and off. But it works and sorts all 8,000 songs pretty quickly and does a good job too!</p></div><h4 id="the-application">The Application</h4><p>The Application itself is pretty simple, an absolute novice with F# like me can read this and get the general idea of what's going on. It's also really small too, so small in fact that it's embedded below. I've done my best at commenting it inline to show what's going on.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Note: This is my first attempt at F#, it's likely non-optimal and not representative of what proper F# devs would write. Please do let me know how it can be improved. I'm on <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_southgate">Twitter @ryan_southgate</a></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><br>Below are a few thoughts on my experience with F#, what I liked and what I didn't. I'm primarily a C# Developer, so comparisons/observations below are with C#.</p><h4 id="what-i-liked">What I Liked</h4><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>I refactored the code twice, without running it - and it worked flawlessly. I'd seldom do this with C#, I run quite regularly in my "dev-loop" and like to compile/run/hit breakpoints as I go.</li>
<li>it's only 60 lines, and is pretty neat, there's no "cruft" (like curly braces), no need for classes (in separate files), no "platform code" (static methods, hepler classes) almost, just code that actually does stuff (instead of Static classes with methods etc)</li>
<li>Type inference, it just worked, there's only 1 reference to "GoogleMusicSong" where as in C# there'd be a few (method params etc)</li>
<li>Putting it all in one file doesn't feel messy, I wouldn't leave this all in one file in C#, it would be split up into separate classes/files</li>
<li>Solution explorer is a waste of space now, there's one proj, with one file - for small console apps like this, I can minimise it</li>
<li>Match statements force you to account for all possibilities and makes sure I haven't forgot a case, C# (<code>if</code>s / <code>switch</code> statements) are more lenient and assume I always know what I'm doing</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h4 id="what-i-didn-t-like">What I Didn't Like</h4><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Intellisense (F12-ing) onto string.contains to see overloads etc doesn't work. This might be something wrong with my installation, but F12-ing onto other members works fine, just that this one doesn't</li>
<li>Lack of intellisense comments on .Net methods mp3/path.split when hovering over them I can't see any description or parameters descriptions. But works fine on Directory.CreateDirectory</li>
<li>My "dev loop" - I'm in the habit of hitting F5 to test code I've just written and add breakpoints at a place where I can inspect the values of new variables I've added. In hindsight I probably should have used F# interactive mode.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>All in all I enjoyed the experience, I'm going to continue chipping away at F#. C# recently (to me), seems to be getting more and more "functional features", so getting a head-start on these is never a bad thing, also increasing exposure to Functional Programming will aid my thinking/reasoning when developing in OO (Object Oriented) programs too.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you've got some improvements to the code above, or some advice (maybe a good book/online learning resource), then I'd love to hear about it and give it a go. Reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_southgate">Twitter</a></p>

<p><span>A</span>yushi Sahu was ambushed. One evening in 2018, five months after her wedding, the 21-year-old college student was visiting her parents in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, when her husband showed up unannounced, his father and uncle in tow.</p>



<p>As the men settled in the living room, her husband said he had something he wanted them to hear. He took out his mobile phone and pressed “play.” The audio was loud and clear: private conversations between Sahu and her friends and family,<strong> </strong>which had been recorded without her permission. And it wasn’t only audio: “call logs, SMS, and WhatsApp messages, each photo and video, recordings of my video calls — he claimed to have accessed everything,” Sahu said. That was when she realized that her husband had, for months, been spying on her.</p>



<p>This was also how Sahu learned of certain things he had been holding against her. (Her name has been changed to protect against retaliation.) He had been offended to hear her complaining to her mother about problems with her in-laws. And he objected to her talking to a male friend. “He made a scene as if he was ‘exposing’ me,” Sahu recalled. “I was just sharing my concerns. That’s normal.”</p>



<p>Her husband played several more recordings, until his father eventually intervened. “I don’t want to listen to any more of this. You have heard it all? Okay, then,” he said, before reaching out to comfort Sahu, who was still in shock.</p>



<p>After processing the experience, Sahu decided she was willing to shrug it off, apologize, and move on, but her new husband continued to behave strangely. Eventually, she felt she had no choice but to end the marriage. “I don’t understand why he had to take this spying route,” she reflected. “He could have just asked. You know, in India, men can scold their wives, right? He could have done that. What was the need to go so deep into my phone and record my conversations?”</p>



<p>Sahu has no idea how her phone was bugged or for how long she was surveilled. But she has one clue: Her Vivo smartphone was an engagement gift from her husband.</p>



<p>It is likely that Sahu’s phone had off-the-shelf spyware on it. Her husband may have installed it himself or even consulted a private detective before marrying her, who provided him with the phone. In either case, he would have been part of a growing trend of individuals — often, jealous lovers — making use of personal surveillance technology.</p>



<p>According to Kunwar Vikram Singh, the chairman of the Association of Private Detectives and Investigators in India, it’s now common for wealthy families to assess the suitability of a potential bride or groom by hiring a private detective, a vetting that usually costs around $500. He attributes this to India’s changing social mores, especially among urban elites. “Work culture has changed. Values have changed,” Singh reflected, citing the influx of women into the workforce as one contributing factor. “We tell people, ‘You spend lakhs and crores on marital ceremonies; spend a few thousand on investigators’,” he said.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, India’s private-detective services have been growing over the past decade. Singh estimates that the sector is now worth roughly $1.2 billion<strong> </strong>nationally. But because of the sensitive nature of the field, it’s impossible to know for sure: There are no official statistics, and many clients still pay in cash. “They don’t want to leave any footprint,” he noted.</p>



<p>The services offered by the detectives mainly fall into two categories: corporate and personal. The corporate investigations often involve banks hiring investigators to get information on shifty borrowers and financial firms looking for background checks on employees. The personal services range from child monitoring to matrimonial background checks. Every agency has its own specialization. Karnam Choudhary, a Jaipur-based detective who operates the Siyol Detective Network, which has around 1,500 freelance private investigators across the country, says that “since 2016, personal cases make up almost 70%.”</p>



<p>The boom in business has coincided with a growing reliance on consumer-grade spyware. These are mostly smartphone apps that cannot easily be detected, secretly record all of a device’s activity, and route that data to a third-party dashboard. A private investigator’s first move used to be shadowing somebody in person; today, many of them begin by advising the client to present the object of their suspicion with a malware-infected smartphone.</p>



<p>Growing demand for spyware first caught the attention of India’s software engineers several years ago, long before the coronavirus pandemic led to a spike. In 2013, while researching viruses and cybersecurity for his final-year engineering project, Gujarat-based coder Tushar Mepani began meeting parents who wanted to keep closer tabs on their teenagers’ whereabouts. “I could not sleep at night when these millionaires told me about their kids’ behavior,” he said, apparently in earnest. The initial prototype of <a href="http://www.convants.com/">what became his first app for tracking children</a>, EasySpyPhone, was restricted to recording calls and collecting text messages and location data, but more recent iterations can spy on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, secretly turn on a phone’s microphone to record calls and video, and capture screenshots, all for around $20 or $40 per month. “Parents were very happy,” Mepani reflected. “They learned who their kids are friends with — and who is diverting them. The app has saved kids from being spoiled.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this, but it clicked with users.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mepani doesn’t sell only one or two products, however; through his Android spyware company, Convants Information Security, he licenses surveillance software to multiple vendors, who repackage it under different names. He won’t reveal the details of these arrangements, calling them “internal business,” but he claims to have made more than 20,000 sales. In 2014, Choudhary, the Jaipur-based detective, used Mepani’s software to launch his <a href="http://spymobileprocess.com/">agency’s own app, Spy Mobile Process</a>. Instead of paying for a full investigation, those who buy Choudhary’s app may use it to conduct their own inquiries, with guidance from detectives. “We had no idea at the time whether people would be interested in this,” he said. “But it clicked with users.”</p>



<p>All of this exists in a legal gray area. As of now, there are no laws in India regulating the selling or purchasing of so-called stalkerware. Nor is there much clarity about the privacy laws currently on the books. In India, it is not illegal to physically surveil a target, for instance, but things get fuzzier when it comes to tracking somebody’s location via mobile phone. Courts have been forced to establish statutes, case by case. In 2018, for instance, a family court in Delhi <a href="https://theprint.in/judiciary/evidence-collected-in-breach-of-privacy-does-not-make-it-inadmissible-in-court-delhi-hc/452288/">admitted evidence collected from spyware</a> in a case concerning a marital dispute, stating that the right to a fair trial outweighed privacy protections.</p>



<p>But staying on the right side of the law doesn’t seem to trouble many spyware vendors. Insofar as they are concerned about legal exposure, most will simply add disclaimers that place the onus on the user. Before installing software, the customer should get “proper written consent to do so by the owner of the smartphone” and understand that it is the “responsibility of the buyer to obey all laws of their country.”</p>



<p>In August 2020, Google introduced a new Ads Policy imposing restrictions on advertising for spyware and surveillance technology. “The updated policy will prohibit the promotion of products or services that are marketed or targeted with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization,” the company wrote in its updated policy. However, Google made two exceptions: “private investigation services,” like Choudhary’s, and “products or services designed for parents to track or monitor their underage children,” like Mepani’s.</p>



<p>Private detectives who admit to using spyware almost universally insist that any problems stemming from it are the result of abuse. But what they say publicly is one thing, and how they market their services is another. While Choudhary claims his app is not intended for spying on spouses, a <a href="https://twitter.com/Siyol007/status/670517689576726528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=notion%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2FSahil-Chajotra-JK-detectives-0f27a3d4a117474eac2b15f591b5d764">November 2015 tweet</a> from his company’s official account said just the opposite. In a series of phone interviews, Mepani also denied marketing his product to jealous husbands and wives, even as his website made clear that these are target demographics. “But you know,” he added, “it is like a knife. You can cut fruits, or you can cut someone’s head.”</p>



<p>However unsettling, the spyware sector is only one small part of a much vaster infrastructure. More than 500 million people in India use the internet every month, creating troves of private information with every click, scroll, swipe, and download. What they watch, how they date, whom they work for, and where they spend their money is constantly being captured and monetized. All this has given rise to a multimillion-dollar dark data economy, in which no piece of information is too personal to trade.</p>

<p><strong>The black market</strong> for data, as it exists online in India, resembles those for wholesale vegetables or smuggled goods. Customers are encouraged to buy in bulk, and the variety of what’s on offer is mind-boggling: There are databases about parents, cable customers, pregnant women, pizza eaters, mutual funds investors, and almost any niche group one can imagine. A typical database consists of a spreadsheet with row after row of names and key details: Sheila Gupta, 35, lives in Kolkata, runs a travel agency, and owns a BMW; Irfaan Khan, 52, lives in Greater Noida, and has a son who just applied to engineering college. The databases are usually updated every three months (the older one is, the less it is worth), and if you buy several at the same time, …</p></div></div>

                  <p>As the sun sets, Tim Bishop walks out the front door of his lodge in his trusted flannel work shirt and worn-in snow boots. On frigid nights, he wears thermals under his jeans. Surrounded by the Snowy Range mountains, Bishop carries a warm dinner made by his wife, a Thermos of hot coffee, and water and snacks to last him through the night. One of his two Australian shepherds follows him through the snow to the Tucker Sno-Cat as he embarks on his long night on the trails.</p>

          <div>

            <p>“When I’m out there, and the moon is up, it’s just gorgeous. […] I’m out there by myself, and I’m at home.”</p>
                        </div>
        
      
    
      

                  <p><span>Bishop works as a snow groomer five nights a week during the depths of Wyoming winters, typically from December through March. He is one of three snow groomers in Medicine Bow, Wyoming. Each night of the week they groom the hundreds of miles of trails in Medicine Bow National Forest from sundown until the wee hours of the morning.</span></p>
      

            
    
      

            
        

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p><span>Tourism is the second-largest industry in Wyoming, and snowmobiling is a significant attraction. Snowmobilers purchase permits from the state each year to sled Medicine Bow National Forest’s trails. After a full day of </span><span>snowmobiles passing over them</span><span>, the trails become rough and require smoothing for the safety and enjoyment of the sledders. Bishop says the state needed someone who lived in the area, was familiar with Medicine Bow National Forest, and could operate big pieces of machinery to work the trails.</span></p>
<p><span>“The snowmobilers want a nice trail to go down,” Bishop says. “I will groom, and the snow will be hard. If I don’t groom it, the snow will get these big ruts, and nobody wants to go down them. It’s more dangerous, it tears the snowmobile up, and it is not as enjoyable.”</span></p>

      </div>

                  <p>The snow groomer looms over the icy landscape with its six-metre frame, including a 1.2 m pan and a heated cab. The machine creates an even surface through a process of warming and moving the snow, with the pan smoothing it out at the end. Precariously teetering along narrow strips of land with cliffs on either side requires a balance of artistry and surgical precision. Bishop fluidly manoeuvres the 3.6 m blades across the wild topography, despite the laborious task.</p>

          <div>

            <p>“In some parts of the trail, you can’t go more than four to five miles [six to eight kilometres] an hour,” Bishop says. The longest trail Bishop grooms is 132 km, and takes him 10 to 14 hours to complete.</p>
                        </div>
        
      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p><span>To become a groomer, Bishop enrolled in a week-long intensive training to learn the basics of the craft. However, like all arts, snow grooming is best learned through practice. Bishop has perfected his approach over the last two years, continuing to learn various nuances of the job.</span></p>
<p><span>“I know the trails,” Bishop says. “It was just a matter of learning to drive the groomer.”</span></p>
<p><span>Even though Bishop knows the terrain intimately, snow grooming can be dangerous. Furious blizzards, whiteouts, 120 km/h winds, and temperatures dropping to -30 </span><b>°</b><span>C are all commonplace on the trails. Bishop says the nights can test your steel as you drive over frozen rivers with water flowing beneath the ice, stare into the green eyes of a stubborn moose, or see mountain lions shred a deer to pieces.</span></p>

      </div>

                  <div>
        <p>“If you break down, you spend the night or you walk out,” Bishop says. “Normally, you don’t want to leave the snowcat because if you turn it off, you may not get it cranked again up there.”</p>
<p>Bishop says the trails also need to be maintained for search and rescue purposes: “If we don’t have trails groomed to get to those places that people get hurt, we can’t get to them.” While he isn’t on the search and rescue team himself, Bishop says he has pulled a stuck vehicle out of a snowbank and picked up stranded snowmobilers and brought them to safety.</p>

          <div>

            <p>The nights when Bishop is bathed in the luminous glow of the moon and stars are his favourites. On top of the mental exercise of navigating the snow groomer through the unmarked trails, he listens to audiobooks to pass the time.</p>
                        </div>
        
      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>“I learn a lot while I’m up there,” he says.</p>
<p>While the solitary work can be lonely, Bishop is never truly alone. Each night he alternates bringing one of his dogs, Roper and Magnum, leaving the other with his wife at their lodge. This ride-along tradition was actually not originally Bishop’s idea. The first time he went grooming, Roper and Magnum trailed their owner across the frozen landscape.</p>
<p>“I just happened to be turning around and found them [the dogs]. I didn’t know they were following me. They went 50 km before I picked them up. If I hadn’t found them where I did, they would have had to go 100 km,” Bishop says, laughing. “They were so sore; they could hardly walk the next day. They are much happier in the cab.”</p>

        <p><span>Bishop and his wife Debbie have lived in Medicine Bow for 18 years. They run Medicine Bow Lodge &amp; Adventure Guest Ranch, which accepts visitors during the spring, summer, and fall. As Bishop prepares his lodges for the winter, he gears up to groom the trails. Bishop says he enjoys the peace of the winter after a busy guest season.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the summer, I’m with people from 6 o’clock in the morning to 8 or 9 o’clock at night, seven days a week, from the end of May to the end of October,” he says. “In the winter, it’s a nice break. I’m not with people. It’s quiet. I can think. I can listen to books. It’s a whole different experience for me.”</span></p>

Well, that could be the case but as studies have shown,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/6-most-common-myths-about-procrastination">we don’t really work better under pressure.</a></p><p>In the majority of cases, we try to protect our self-image of being smart, great at what we do. Let us explain.</p><p>Procrastinators often believe:</p><p>Self-worth = ability = performance</p><p>Their self-worth is based on what they’re able to do. The proof of what they’re able to do is based on their performance.</p><p>Bad presentation = I’m worthless..<br>Bad painting = I’m no good at this.<br>Unanswered message = I’m not good enough.</p><p>This pressure can be so great that procrastinators choose to avoid making an effort altogether. Why? Because then they have an excuse.</p><p>When you wait close to the deadline, you break the equation. Your performance is not a reflection of your ability anymore, because you didn’t have time to truly perform.</p><p>Suddenly, all 3 possible outcomes are fine:</p><p>Your performance on the task is a success - your self-image is preserved and improved.&nbsp;<em>Omg, look at me, I achieved this with so little time left. Only if I had all the time in the world, then the result would be even more spectacular.</em></p><p>The performance is average - your self-image is preserved.&nbsp;<em>It’s okay but if I had more time, I would ace it.</em></p><p>The performance is a failure - your self-image is preserved.&nbsp;<em>I simply didn’t have enough time to succeed. If I had the time, I’d definitely succeed. If only I’d started earlier...</em></p><p>So instead of showing our real abilities, we’re just testing how well we perform when we don't have enough time. This phenomenon is called self-handicapping and leaving yourself little time to complete a task is one of the most common examples of it. We’re protecting ourselves from testing our real abilities and then finding out that we’re still not good enough. It would ruin our view of our talent and intelligence.</p><h2>How to start working early(ier)</h2><p>If you want to finish tasks ahead of time and enjoy peace for once, first you need to break the equation:</p><p>Self-worth = ability = performance</p><h3>1. Realize performance doesn’t reflect just our ability</h3><p><em>Performance = ability</em>&nbsp;is a simplistic view.</p><p>In reality, it looks more like this:</p><p>Performance = ability * motivation * energy * time * luck</p><p>So when you think about it, your performance doesn’t really prove or disprove your ability and self-worth.</p><p>Sometimes, you could be really skilled at a task (high ability) but because you’re super tired, your result isn’t worth much.</p><p>In collective sports, players often have high skill, a lot of energy, and motivation but because they aren’t lucky, they don’t score. The best athletes know that luck will come and go and they need to keep trying instead of feeling down after not getting lucky.</p><p>After you realize that performance is determined by many more variables, you stop being so scared of performing.</p><h3>2. Believe your ability can always grow</h3><p>Even if your ability is low and it’s the cause of your bad performance, it isn’t the end state. You can always change, learn, improve, and grow.</p><p>You probably don’t remember how difficult it was learning to walk. You tried at least a thousand times. Then slowly your feet and brain learned to coordinate together to hold a balance. Now, you don’t ever think about how simple it is to hold balance while standing on your feet.</p><p>You also don’t remember how much you struggled when you learned to read and write.  Mat here: I remember I came home from school one day when I was learning to read in the first grade. We had homework to do to practice reading. It was more difficult than the elementary words (like mom and dad) and I really struggled. I started crying and threw away the textbook because I thought I could never do it and I would stay illiterate forever. Guess what, I was wrong that day.</p><p>“Life-long learning” became a buzzword but it’s really true. Everyone has the ability to learn, no matter how old we are, and we can usually do it faster than we think.</p><p>When you realize this, bad performance doesn’t have to mean that it’s the end of the world. Instead, it tells you that you have something to work on.</p><h3>3. Your performance doesn’t have to be perfect</h3><p>We often think that we should be getting to the best possible result there is. There are usually external pressures (like parents, friends, or bosses, marketing) that push us to be the best ever..</p><p>In reality, most things don’t really matter and they don’t need  to be perfect. Often,&nbsp;<strong>good enough is sufficient.</strong></p><p>The goal doesn’t necessarily have to be to get A’s,&nbsp;<a href="http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/">maybe the goal is to pass.</a></p><p>Maybe the goal isn’t to be in Instagram-worthy shape, but to be healthy and happy.</p><p>Maybe the goal isn’t to write a perfect report, it may be writing a simple report fast so that the right people are informed correctly and on time.</p><p>Not perfect, good enough.</p><p>When you understand this, a great weight lifts off your shoulders because you know you don’t need to be perfect.</p><h3>4. Increase your self-esteem</h3><p>Self-worth is directly connected to self-esteem.</p><p>When self-esteem is low and vulnerable, people tend to procrastinate way more. They’re even more dependent on their performance proving or disproving their self-worth.</p><p>Increasing self-esteem can become a catch-22 situation. You procrastinate because your self-esteem is low. However, you don’t want to start working because it might be proof that you’re bad and don’t deserve it. We cover this topic much more extensively in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/guide">guide - How to finally stop procrastinating</a>, but here’s the short version:</p><p><strong>Start stacking small wins.</strong></p><p>Find something, anything, that you can do and do it. Look for tasks that you can successfully complete.</p><p>Every win will prove to yourself that you can change and improve. This trust in your abilities will translate into higher self-esteem.</p><p>When you have high enough self-esteem, you stop caring so much about any one  performance.&nbsp;<em>One bad attempt? No worries, I’ll do better next time.</em></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>To stop self-sabotaging and start working early:</p><ol><li>Realize that your performance doesn’t reflect your ability and self worth.</li><li>Believe your abilities can always grow.</li><li>Understand that your performance doesn’t have to be perfect.</li><li>Increase your self-esteem by stacking small wins.</li></ol><p>So, do you have a project that you’ve been putting off?</p><p>Start today, imperfectly.</p></article></div>]]>

    <p>Matrix is an instant messaging system similar to Whatsapp or Telegram, but
uses an open and decentralized network for secure and privacy-protected
communications. NeoChat is a visually attractive Matrix client that works on
desktop computers and mobile phones.</p>
<h2 id="convergence">Convergence</h2>
<p>NeoChat provides an elegant and convergent user interface, allowing
it to adapt to any screen size automatically and gracefully.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.plasma-mobile.org/img/post-2020-11/neochat-drawer.png" alt="Image"></p>
<p>This means you can use it both on desktop computers, where you might want to
have a small bar on the side of your screen, but you can also enjoy NeoChat
on Plasma Mobile and Android phones.</p>
<p>In fact, NeoChat will be installed by default on the PinePhone KDE edition and
we offer a <a href="https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/Android/job/Neochat_android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nightly Android
version</a>
too. The Android version is for the moment experimental and some
features, like file uploading, don’t work yet.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>NeoChat provides a timeline with support for simple messages and also allows
you to upload images and video and audio files. You can reply to messages and
add reactions.</p>
<p>NeoChat provides all the basic features chat application needs: apart from
sending and responding to messages, you can invite users to a room, start
private chats, create new rooms and explore public rooms.</p>

<p>A lot of care has been put into making NeoChat intuitive to use. For
example, copying with Ctrl+C and dragging and dropping images just work; and
the text field gets autofocused so that you are never writing into the void.
NeoChat also integrates an emoji picker, letting you use the greatest invention
of the <del>21st century</del>. (Note: someone in Mastodon pointed out that
Emojis are from the 20th century and appeared in 1997 in Japan.)</p>
<h2 id="image-editor">Image Editor</h2>
<p>NeoChat also includes a basic image editor that lets you crop and rotate
images before sending them. The image editor is provided by a small library
called KQuickImageEditor.</p>

<p>This library for the moment doesn’t have a stable API and is released together
with NeoChat.</p>
<h2 id="why-matrix-and-neochat">Why Matrix and NeoChat</h2>
<p>Matrix is an open network for secure and decentralized communication. This is an
initiative that is very much aligned with KDE’s goals of creating an open
operating system for everybody. This is why we need a Matrix client that
integrates into Plasma and thus NeoChat was born.</p>
<p>NeoChat is a fork of Spectral, another QML client, and uses the
libQuotient library to interact with the Matrix protocol. We would like to send
out a huge thank you to these two projects and their contributors. Without
them, NeoChat wouldn’t have been possible.</p>
<p>NeoChat uses the <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirigami framework</a>
and QML to provide an elegant and convergent user interface.</p>
<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>NeoChat is fully translated in English, Ukrainian, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese,
Hungarian, French, Dutch, Catalan (Valencian), Catalan, British English,
Italian, Norwegian Nynorsk and Slovenian. Thanks a lot to all the translators
and if NeoChat is not available in your native language consider joining <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE
localization team</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-missing">What is Missing</h2>
<p>For the moment, encryption support is missing and NeoChat doesn’t support video
calls and editing messages yet either. Both things are in the works.</p>
<p>We are also missing some integration with the rest of the KDE applications,<br>
like with <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/purpose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purpose</a>, which will
allow NeoChat to be used to share content from other KDE applications; and
with <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/sonnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonnet</a>, which will provide
spellchecking features.</p>
<p>The fastest way to implement these deficiencies is to get involved! The
NeoChat team is a friendly group of developers and Matrix enthusiasts. Join us
and help us make NeoChat a great Matrix client! You can join us at
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#neochat:kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#neochat:kde.org</a>. We also participate
to Season of KDE, so if you want to get mentored on a project and at the end
get a cool KDE T-Shirt, feel free to say hi.</p>
<h2 id="tarballs">Tarballs</h2>
<p>Unfortunally there was an error generating the tarbals, we are working on it
and new tarbals will be created shortly.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of NeoChat is availabe <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/neochat/1.0/neochat-1.0.tar.xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>,
kquickimageeditor 0.1.2 is availabe <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/kquickimageeditor/0.1/kquickimageeditor-0.1.2.tar.xz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
Both packages are signed with my gpg key <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/gpg.html">14B0ED91B5783415D0AA1E0A06B35D38387B67BE</a>.</p>
<p>A Flathub release will hopefully be released in the next few days. We will
update this post when it is available.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: CPS-conversion and defunctionalization can help you to come up with a constant-stack algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Turns out I inadvertedly plagiarized the talk <a href="https://t.co/YlN0MOnN83?amp=1">The Best Refactoring You’ve Never Heard Of</a> by James Koppel. Please consider this a form of sincere flattery.</p>
<h3 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h3>
<p>Today, I’ll take you on a another little walk through the land of program transformations. Let’s begin with a simple binary tree, with value of unknown type in the leaves, as well as the canonical <code>map</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>T</span> a <span>=</span> <span>L</span> a <span>|</span> <span>B</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> a)

<span>map1 ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map1 f (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
map1 f (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (map1 f t1) (map1 f t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this <code>map</code> function is using the program stack as it traverses the tree. Our goal is now to come up with a <code>map</code> function that does <em>not</em> use the stack!</p>
<p>Why? Good question! In Haskell, there wouldn’t be a strong need for this, as the Haskell stack is allocated on the heap, just like your normal data, so there is plenty of stack space. But in other languages or environments, the stack space may have a hard limit, and it may be advised to not use unbounded stack space.</p>
<p>That aside, it’s a fun exercise, and that’s sufficient reason for me.</p>
<p>(In the following, I assume that tail-calls, i.e. those where a function end with another function call, but without modifying its result, do not actually use stack space. Once <em>all</em> recursive function calls are tail calls, the code is equivalent to an imperative loop, as we will see.)</p>
<h3 id="think">Think?</h3>
<p>We <em>could</em> now just stare at the problem (rather the code), and try to come up with a solution directly. We’d probably think “ok, as I go through the tree, I have to remember all the nodes <em>above</em> me… so I need a list of those nodes… and for each of these nodes, I also need to remember whether I am currently processing the left child, and yet have to look at the right one, or whether I am done with the left child… so what do I have to remember about the current node…?”</p>
<p>… ah, my brain spins already. Maybe eventually I figure it out, but why think when we can <em>derive</em> the solution? So let’s start with above <code>map1</code>, and rewrite it, in several, mechanical, steps into a stack-less, tail-recursive solution.</p>
<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>Before we set out, let me rewrite the <code>map</code> function using a local <code>go</code> helper, as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map2 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map2 f t <span>=</span> go t
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (go t1) (go t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>This transformation (effectively the “static argument transformation”) has the nice advantage that we do not have to pass <code>f</code> around all the time, and that when we copy the function, I only have to change the top-level name, but not the names of the inner functions.</p>
<p>Also, I find it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="cps">CPS</h3>
<p>A blunt, effective tool to turn code that is not yet using tail-calls into code that only uses tail-calls is use <em>continuation-passing style</em>. If we have a function of type <code>… -&gt; t</code>, we turn it into a function of type <code>… -&gt; (t -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code>, where <code>r</code> is the type of the result we want at the very end. This means the function now receives an extra argument, often named <code>k</code> for continuation, and instead of returning some <code>x</code>, the function calls <code>k x</code>.</p>
<p>We can apply this to our <code>go</code> function. Here, both <code>t</code> and <code>r</code> happen to be <code>T b</code>; the type of finished trees:</p>
<pre><code>map3 :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
map3 f t = go t (\r -&gt; r)
  where
    go :: T a -&gt; (T b -&gt; T b) -&gt; T b
    go (L x) k  = k (L (f x))
    go (B t1 t2) k  = go t1 (\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></pre>
<p>Note that when initially call <code>go</code>, we pass the identity function <code>(\r -&gt; r)</code> as the initial continuation.</p>
<p>Alas, suddenly all function calls are in tail position, and this codes does not use stack space! Technically, we are done, although it is not quite satisfying; all these lambdas floating around obscure the meaning of the code, are maybe a bit slow to execute, and also, we didn’t really learn much yet. This is certainly <em>not</em> the code we would have writing after “thinking hard”.</p>
<h3 id="defunctionalization">Defunctionalization</h3>
<p>So let’s continue rewriting the code to something prettier, simpler. Something that does not use lambdas like this.</p>
<p>Again, there is a mechanical technique that can help it. It likely won't make the code prettier, but it will get rid of the lambdas, so let’s do that an clean up later.</p>
<p>The technique is called <em>defunctionalization</em> (because it replaces functional values by plain data values), and can be seen as a form of <em>refinement</em>.</p>
<p>Note that we pass around vales of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, but we certainly don’t <em>mean</em> the full type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. Instead, only very specific values of that type occur in our program, So let us replace <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code> with a data type that contains representatives of <em>just</em> the values we actually use.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We find at all values of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We create a datatype with one constructor for each of these:</p>

<p>(This is not complete yet.)</p></li>
<li><p>We introduce an <em>interpretation</em> function that turns a <code>K</code> back into a <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>=</span> (<span>*</span> <span>TBD</span> <span>*</span>)</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>In the function <code>go</code>, instead of taking a parameter of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, we take a <code>K</code>. And when we actually <em>use</em> the continuation, we have to turn the <code>K</code> back to the function using eval:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k <span>=</span> go t1 <span>K1</span></code></pre></div>
We also do this to the code fragments identified in the first step; these become:
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 K2)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; eval k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now we complete the <code>eval</code> function: For each constructor, we simply map it to the corresponding lambda from step 1:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
eval <span>K1</span> <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 <span>K2</span>)
eval <span>K2</span> <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t quite work yet: We have variables on the right hand side that are not bound (<code>t2</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>k</code>). So let’s add them to the constructors <code>K1</code> and <code>K2</code> as needed. This also changes the type <code>K</code> itself; it now needs to take type parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This leads us to the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>K</span> a b
  <span>=</span> <span>I</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>K1</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>K</span> a b)
  <span>|</span> <span>K2</span> (<span>T</span> b) (<span>K</span> a b)

<span>map4 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map4 f t <span>=</span> go t <span>I</span>
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> go t1 (<span>K1</span> t2 k)

<span>    eval ::</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
    eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
    eval (<span>K1</span> t2 k) <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 (<span>K2</span> r1 k))
    eval (<span>K2</span> r1 k) <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div>
<p>Not really cleaner or prettier, but everything is still tail-recursive, <em>and</em> we are now working with plain data.</p>
<h3 id="we-like-lists">We like lists</h3>
<p>To clean it up a little bit, we can notice that the <code>K</code> data type really is just a list of values, where the values are either <code>T a</code> or <code>T b</code>. We do not need a custom data type for this! Instead of our <code>K</code>, we can just use the following, built from standard data types:</p>
<pre><code>type K' a b = [Either (T a) (T b)]</code></pre>
<p>Now I replace <code>I</code> with <code>[]</code>, <code>K1 t2 k</code> with <code>Left t2 : k</code> and <code>K2 r1 k</code> with <code>Right r1 : k</code>. I also, very suggestively, rename <code>go</code> to <code>down</code> and <code>eval</code> to <code>up</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map5 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map5 f t <span>=</span> down t []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    down ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    down (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> up k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    down (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> down t1 (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)

<span>    up ::</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    up [] r <span>=</span> r
    up (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) r1 <span>=</span> down t2 (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    up (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) r2 <span>=</span> up k (<span>B</span> r1 r2)</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, the code suddenly makes more sense again. In fact, I can try to verbalize it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we traverse the tree, we have to remember for all parent nodes, whether there is still something <code>Left</code> to do when we come back to it (so we remember a <code>T a</code>), or if we are done with that (so we have a <code>T b</code>). This is the list <code>K' a b</code>.</p>
<p>We begin to go <code>down</code> the left of the tree (noting that the right siblings are still left to do), until we hit a leaf. We transform the leaf, and then go <code>up</code>.</p>
<p>If we go <code>up</code> and hit the root, we are done. Else, if we go <code>up</code> and there is something <code>Left</code> to do, we remember the subtree that we just processed (as that is already in the <code>Right</code> form), and go <code>down</code> the other subtree. But if we go <code>up</code> and there is nothing <code>Left</code> to do, we put the two subtrees together and continue going up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite neat!</p>

<p>At this point we could stop: the code is pretty, makes sense, and has the properties we want. But let’s turn the dial a bit further and try to make it an imperative loop.</p>
<p>We know that if we have a single tail-recursive function, then that’s equivalent to a loop, with the function’s parameter turning into mutable variables. But we have two functions!</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have two functions <code>a -&gt; r</code> and <code>b -&gt; r</code> that have the same return type (which they necessarily have here, since we CPS-converted them further up), then those two functions are equivalent to a <em>single</em> function taking “<code>a</code> or <code>b</code>”, i.e. <code>Either a b -&gt; r</code>. This really nothing else than the high-school level algebra rule of <span><em>r</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ⋅ <em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>r</em><sup><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></sup></span>.</p>
<p>So (after reordering the arguments of <code>down</code> to put <code>T b</code> first) we can rewrite the code as</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map6 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map6 f t <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t) []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>Either</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>L</span> x))     k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>L</span> (f x))) k
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>B</span> t1 t2)) k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t1) (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r)  []             <span>=</span> r
    go (<span>Right</span> r1) (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>B</span> r1 r2)) k</code></pre></div>
<p>Do you see the loop yet? If not, maybe it helps to compare it with the following equivalent imperative looking pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>mapLoop :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
mapLoop f t {
  var node = Left t;
  var parents = [];
  while (true) {
    switch (node) {
      Left (L x) -&gt; node := Right (L (f x))
      Left (B t1 t2) -&gt; node := Left t1; parents.push(Left t2)
      Right r1 -&gt; {
        if (parents.len() == 0) {
          return r1;
        } else {
          switch (parents.pop()) {
            Left t2  -&gt; node := Left t2; parents.push(Right r1);
            Right r2 -&gt; node := Right (B r1 r2)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

        <small>23 December 2020</small>


<p>by Gianni Tedesco</p>

<p>If you have <em>ever</em> installed the <code>virtio-win</code> package in accordance with the
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-windows-virtual-machines-using-virtio-drivers/index.html">instructions from
fedora</a>,
then your system is vulnerable to a remote root exploit every time you do a yum
upgrade, and will stay like that forever more, until you remove the virtio-win
yum repo.</p>

<p>That is because the instructions tell you to setup a yum repo with the with a
plain http <code>baseurl</code> and <code>gpgcheck=0</code>… This, essentially, disables all
security and allows a network man-in-the-middle (even a regular old web proxy)
to inject bogus updates every time you do a <code>dnf upgrade</code> - which will be
nightly if you have installed <code>dnf-automatic</code>.</p>

<p>This entire process, including exploitation, can happen without dnf providing
any hint to the user that it is downloading arbitrary code insecurely over the
internet and running it.</p>


<p>Turns out that there is not a whole lot you can do about this yet. My best
advice to you is to disable this yum repo immediately.</p>

<p>I reported this bug <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1878594">in
September</a> but it turns
out it had already been <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1353036">reported in January
2016</a>.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/virtio-win/virtio-win-pkg-scripts/issues/24">a github
issue</a> tracking
the change required to sign the contents of virtio-win repository.</p>


<p>Note, that the windows drivers themselves are signed. That’s because loading
windows drivers without signatures is a complete rigmarole so the drivers would
be next to useless if they weren’t signed.</p>

<p>But here, the signatures are luring people in to a false sense of security
because you may imagine that since all RPM is doing is downloading some opaque
blobs which only a guest will install, that as long as the blobs are signed and
the windows guest OS verifies them then an end-to-end root of trust is
established.</p>

<p>But this is not so, since the Linux host is compromised. All an attacker has to
do is create a new RPM based on the old virtio-win RPMs (including all the
valid signatures) and just add a <code>%postinstall</code> RPM script which roots the
host. So now it doesn’t matter that the guest is secure, because the host is
compromised. And if the host is compromised then all bets about the integrity
of the guest are off.</p>

<p>If RPM applied its signatures with the same dilligence as Windows update, we
probably would not be in this mess.</p>

<p>I also filed <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1878595">a bug against
dnf</a> that it insecurely
installs code from the internet without so much as a warning message.</p>


<p>Initially I thought that a quick workaround would be to change the repo URL to
https. After all, <code>fedoraproject.org</code> should be trustworthy.</p>

<p>But according to the DNF developers “DNF is happy with any HTTPS connection,
even with a self-signed certificate and a complete redirect to a different
server would be unnoticed.”</p>

<p>Apparently there is a plan to solve this but it won’t land before RHEL9 because
the user experience would necessarily change if dnf were to check HTTPS
certificates.</p>

<p>Of course, there are good historical reasons not to use TLS, it breaks
caching. But given todays threat landscape, mirror services may just want to
suck up this cost.</p>


<p>Merry christmas, happy new year, it’ll soon be 2021, and here’s to another year
of telling people that arbitrary remote code execution is arbitrary remote code
execution.</p>

<p>You can refer to the virtio-win repo issue as <code>CVE-2020-29665</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-12-23">December 23, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few weeks ago, we wrote a massively successful <a href="#">IMGZ systems architecture article</a> that ended up going viral (note to editor: are we still allowed to say "viral" in 2020?) and upending the world of image hosting.
Here we were, a small newcomer, poised to take on the giants of the multi-billion-dollar image hosting industry with our new, innovative and daring business model of charging people for services.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all the media attention caused our user count to skyrocket, and our subscription graph started exhibiting the familiar "hockey stick" pattern that every VC in Silicon Valley wants to be hit with:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/iQYRKWrE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Rather unsurprisingly, such an influx of new users caused a deluge of new content being uploaded to the platform. We estimate that, with our current level of usage, up to a thousand images could be getting uploaded to the service every year.</p>
<p>Naturally, we immediately sprang into action to preserve the reliability of our infrastructure, and quickly drew up a scaling plan that would enable the service to withstand its newfound popularity. This is where our foresight when designing the service paid off, as the hosting provider we use let us quickly perform the necessary changes and provision an extra gigabyte of disk space.</p>
<h2>One thing becomes clear</h2>
<p>However, one thing became clear: We could not sustain this breakneck pace for long by ourselves. This was never more obvious than a few days ago, when we realized we were close to failing to meet our uptime guarantee for 2020, and had to take the service offline for a few days to bring our uptime down to what we promised.</p>
<p>This event highlighted that there is just too much to do in a fledgling startup that aims to become the next MySpace, and even more to do in one that specifically wants to <em>avoid</em> becoming the next MySpace. If we were ever to realize the IMGZ vision and change the world, we needed more people.</p>
<h2>We're hiring!</h2>
<p>If you're young, passionate about creating software that changes the world and don't know what "3x investor preference" means, you're exactly who we're looking for! You have the opportunity to join an innovative, fast-growing company with a modern technology stack.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we don't just want to serve images, no. The values of IMGZ are far loftier than that. At IMGZ we live and breathe images to the point where our values can only be communicated <strong>with</strong> an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgz.org/i9xyk2H2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In talking with various prospective hires, one thing became abundantly clear: Nobody joins a startup for the money, they do it to get rich. With this in mind, we found the perfect balance of the "early startup employee" compensation package: 50% stock, 50% equity, 0% salary.</p>
<p>That's right! We can maximize the potential of your stock by doing away with a significant company expense: Employee salaries. This way, your stock is much more likely to be worth a lot more (and you have a lot of it, since our packages start at three trillion shares per employee! That's a big number).</p>
<p>Everyone we discussed this with loved the approach, and it makes intuitive sense: Name one Google employee who became a millionaire from their salary. We bet you can't, yet all of us know the name of that cleaning lady who was given Google stock and now she has "VC" on her CV, you know the one we're talking about.</p>
<h2>Interview process</h2>
<p>Like any self-respecting Silicon Valley startup, we can't just settle for any old 10x rockstar developer who wants to join. Firing people is expensive, you know? That is why we have prepared a thorough, six-stage interview process.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a pragmatic, practice-driven development team, and we want to see how you perfom in real-world scenarios, so you will be given a feature from our product roadmap and will be asked to develop it to your satisfaction. Afterwards, we will use this feature in our product and see how users like it. If they do, that will be a point in your favor.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't really know if you developed the feature yourself or paid someone on Fiverr to do it for you, so for the next stage of the interview we will ask you to invert a data structure on a whiteboard. None of us knows how or cares enough about what you're doing, so we'll pretend to not like random things about your solution until you're on the verge of tears, to evaluate how you fare against the ever-changing requirements that come with bad leadership.</p>
<p>If you pass the whiteboard interviews without cracking, we'll introduce you to everyone on the team, making sure you have at least eight hours of one-on-one time with various staff members, often more than once. This is just so we get to know you better and see what you're like in social situations.</p>
<p>After wasting a few days of your time and ours, we'll finally adjourn and haphazardly email each other about you, mostly trying to remember which applicant you were from flaws in your appearance. We'll then round up all the notes and observations from your technical interviews and summarize everything we know about you into one list.</p>
<p>For the final decision, we'll look at the list and evaluate you purely on your technical merits, trying to confirm the judgment that we've already subconsciously formed based on how much you are like us. If you are too different, we're sorry, no matter how good you are technically, we'll pass. In this company, we value one thing above all others: Diversity.</p>
<h2>Apply today!</h2>
<p>If the above sounds appealing, excellent! Reach out to us at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><span data-cfemail="6a02031803040d2a03070d1044090507">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to get the ball rolling, and you might soon be "working" for the best image host in the world, IMGZ!</p>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>The aim of this post is to show you how to build a Kubernetes cluster with Raspberry Pi 4s for self-hosting APIs, websites and functions so that you can expose them on the Internet and serve traffic to users. Use it to evaluate your current setup, or to plan a new build including: hardware options, HA, Ingress, storage and Operating System choices.</p>
<p>We'll start by addressing the usual questions, before going on to explore a number of topics in detail. These are my preferences built-up after <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/five-years-of-raspberry-pi-clusters/">building clusters on Raspberry Pi for 5 years</a>. I'd also like to learn from you, so feel free to tweet to me <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">@alexellisuk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why self host?</strong></p>
<p>The only valid reason here is: because you want to. And if the idea of self-hosting something turns you off, then stop reading now and post a derisive comment on Hacker News.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUpF40--60"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnSvvQRXcAEEr1w?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="My demo rig for the KubeCon talk"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>KubeCon talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfUpF40--60">The Past, Present, and Future of Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The costs of cloud</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was speaking to a friend recently that told me they were paying 7USD / mo to host 20 small projects on a well-known PaaS. That would have been costing them around 1700USD per year, moving those workloads to an RPi would save a fortune.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running a Kubernetes cluster on one of the cheapest providers like <a href="https://m.do.co/c/f0d7296632e4">DigitalOcean</a> can still set you back 60-120 USD / mo for a modest cluster. You can get much better value with your own hardware, whether that's with an old PC or some Raspberry Pis. I'm not saying that you should call your boss and give him the good news, but there is a certain crowd who enjoy building and running infrastructure, they also tend to enjoy cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>"But, I have no use-case"</strong></p>
<p>Quite often my content on Raspberry Pi can be divisive. It brings the best out of some people, and the worst out of others.</p>
<p>Let me put this succinctly - the Raspberry Pi is a Linux server. If you write code, or "do DevOps" for a day-job, you have a use-case. If you use a computer on a daily basis, you have a use-case.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/4rea8y.jpg" alt="Meme"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll just leave this here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why use the Raspberry Pi?</strong></p>
<p>If you have the budget to buy some used workstations, NUCs, or servers on eBay, they will perform better, but they also take up more space and draw more power. Fortunately, most of what we'll cover will apply to Raspberry Pi and whatever Intel kit you can get your hands on.</p>
<p><strong>But, I thought SD cards were unreliable?</strong></p>
<p>Now that the <a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/upgrade-your-raspberry-pi-4-with-a-nvme-boot-drive-d9ab4e8aa3c2">RPi 4 can boot from an SSD or NVMe over USB</a>, the reliability of SD cards no longer needs to be a concern. The RPi 4 has much faster I/O, up to 8GB of RAM available along with a quad-core processor. Not only is it suitable for self-hosting many types of application, but it is likely to outperform smaller shared VPSes or EC2 instances since it's a dedicated host.</p>
<p>It's now trivial to build a cluster that can tolerate a node failure using K3s and its now embedded etcd mode which was introduced in K3s 1.19.</p>
<p>There are naturally some draw-backs to self-hosting: you have a dependency on your ISP's uptime, your significant other or children could unplug your infrastructure (yes it happens), but I think you will have fun and hone your skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So whether you're building a home-lab, or looking to host websites, APIs and automation tools, I hope you'll find the recommendations useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The parts from my latest K3s build</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="billofmaterialshardware">Bill of materials (hardware)</h3>
<p>You will need at least one Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB RAM or more. I would recommend that you buy three if you wish to run a HA cluster, that can tolerate a node failure.</p>
<p><strong>Managing costs</strong></p>
<p>Let me put this in bold: <strong>you do not need to spend a fortune to build a cluster</strong>. 4x RPi 4 including taxes in the UK runs to about 33 GBP per unit ~ about 130 GBP total. If you just want the experience of self-hosting, and to learn about Kubernetes without having to spend too much, you could buy a single 4GB RPi 4 for around 54 GBP including taxes.</p>
<p><strong>A note on the RPi3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 and CM3 are both <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/2353">having issues with K3s</a>, particulary if you are running anything later than 1.17. If you have an existing investment (as I do), I would suggest selling them or giving them away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cases and cooling off</strong></p>
<p>Whatever case you decide to use, make sure it has a fan. You can compare options in my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/cooling-off-your-rpi4/">Cooling off your Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>
<p>The best options for cases are either one of the sets of acrylic plates and stand-offs that can be bought for 20-25 USD on Amazon, or a professional-grade <a href="https://bitscope.com/blog/JK/?p=JK38B">BitScope Cluster Blade</a>. Whatever you do, do not buy the original first-generation BitScope Blade which doesn't support the RPi4 or have cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Buy the best power adapter</strong></p>
<p>Do not buy a multi-charger for the RPi4, they may appear to work, however if you look into things you will find that they are "browning out". Official adapters are not expensive, my advise is not to be stingy.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to storage, you will need at least a 32GB SD card, but I would encourage you to go one further and buy solid state storage. Read about the performance differences in my post: <a href="https://alexellisuk.medium.com/upgrade-your-raspberry-pi-4-with-a-nvme-boot-drive-d9ab4e8aa3c2">Upgrade your Raspberry Pi 4 with a NVMe boot drive</a>. Some ask whether an M2 SSD is sufficient with the USB-bus of the RPi4 causing a bottleneck. They make a good point however the NVMe performs better, has a similar cost and can be used in one of your PCs at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="kuberneteskubeadmvsk3s">Kubernetes - kubeadm vs. k3s?</h3>
<p>Until late 2019, most of us were still struggling to run <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/k8s-on-raspbian">upstream Kubernetes on our RPis with kubeadm</a>, and it was not a pleasant experience. Why? Because kubeadm was designed to run on high-performance Intel cloud servers, not on low-powered ARM SoCs.</p>
<p><img width="30%" src="https://k3s.io/images/logo-k3s.svg" alt="k3s"></p><p>The headlines for K3s claim 500MB of RAM is required for a server, increasing 256MB when using embedded etcd. The claim for an agent is 50MB of RAM. Whatever the actual usage is, it's going to be much less than kubeadm and put less of a load on the system.</p>
<h3 id="32bitor64bitos">32-bit or 64-bit OS?</h3>
<p>From my perspective the main limitation of a 32-bit OS is the 3GB process limit. That isn't something that I'm particularly worried about, but maybe you are? What the question really comes down to is: do you want to use Ubuntu or RaspiOS?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Raspi-PGB001.png" width="30%">
<img src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/fe951eda-20.10_Groovy+Gorilla_RPi_Sketch.svg" width="20%"></p><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation do have a beta version of RaspiOS out, however it isn't the lite edition and comes with a fully-loaded desktop.</p>
<p>In my experience with K3s, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-10-on-raspberry-pi-delivers-the-full-linux-desktop-and-micro-clouds">Ubuntu 20.10</a> works equally well as RaspiOS Lite on the RPi4. I tend to recommend with RaspiOS with its 32-bit OS because most Raspberry Pi users already use this and are comfortable with it.</p>
<h3 id="sourcingappsandcharts">Sourcing apps and charts</h3>
<p>Sourcing apps and charts can be tricky with ARM, as many maintainers have not yet considering porting their software to this architecture.</p>
<p>For that reason I built the <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a> project as an Open Source Kubernetes Marketplace. You can use it to install apps whether they are packaged as Helm charts, YAML manifests or shipped with their own CLI.</p>
<p>Why not use helm? Well in some instances it does, but where a package is not available for ARM, it will tell you. Where a chart has 150 configuration options, the <code>--help</code> text tells you the ones we think you'll need. The <code>arkade info APP</code> command gives you instructions on how to use the chart, and you can get that back at any time without installing the app again.</p>

There are now over 40 packages and many contributors. Notable packages that work on Raspberry Pi are: Minio, OpenFaaS, cert-manager, ingress-nginx, Traefik 2, Linkerd, SealedSecrets and the Kubernetes dashboard.</p>
<p>You can install of them using arkade install:</p>
<pre><code>arkade install APP
</code></pre>
<p>arkade also offers a fast download of CLIs to prevent breaking the flow when you're following instructions. How many times have you ran "brew update" and then instantly regretted it?</p>
<pre><code>arkade get kubectl [--version 0.19.5]
arkade get kubectx
arkade get helm
arkade get terraform
</code></pre>
<p>Each package is downloaded as a static binary and put in your PATH. It doesn't matter if you're using Intel or ARM, Linux, MacOS or Windows, the correct binary (if available) will be downloaded.</p>

<h3 id="ingressandloadbalancers">Ingress and LoadBalancers</h3>
<p>There are two main ways I would expose services on Kubernetes. The first is to use a LoadBalancer, this is what you will be most used to from using managed Kubernetes clusters. By setting your Service as a <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> and giving a number of ports, a cloud load-balancer is provisioned and starts routing traffic on the given IP address.</p>
<p>When running at home, you can use a tool like <a href="https://kube-vip.io/">kube-vip</a> or <a href="https://metallb.universe.tf/">MetalLB</a>, but they will only give you IP addresses on your local network, which external users cannot access. If you are thinking of using these tools, you may as well just use a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">NodePort</a> and forego the additional tooling. A NodePort makes a high port number such as 31112 available on all your nodes, which then routes traffic to the exposed service.</p>
<p>Many homelab'ers will be aware of port-forwarding, where your home router can be set to forward traffic on a given set of ports to hosts on your internal network. This is achieved through mapping a high non-standard port number to the internal port. Unfortunately, many home users are inadvertently giving away their location, their ISP customer number (Virgin Media, I'm looking at you), and in some instance, a good estimation of their home address. Now on top of all of that, you cannot take that IP address with you, so if you close the lid of your laptop running K3s, and open the lid on a captive portal in a coffee shop, your services will no longer be available.</p>
<p>Likewise, your IP is likely to change. The mitigation is to run a daemon that continually checks your IP address and updates your DNS records.</p>
<p>That all sounds like a lot of hard work to me.</p>
<p>In the early days, I used to use Ngrok which tunnels out from your internal network, but unfortunately I kept running into its connection and rate-limiting. It also has no Kubernetes integration, and it's not for lack of trying - Joe Beda (a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 20, 2020<!-- --> in<!-- --> <span><a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I have been learning chess (again) and how to program a chess engine (for the first time) over the last month. After skimming some introductory texts, I was convinced that building a simple chess engine — one that would put up a fair fight against a casual player — would take no more than a few days.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But I made it there in the end and created a toy chess engine (<a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">healeycodes/andoma</a>) that I am proud of. It can play a game of chess and solve simple chess puzzles like mate-in-two or mate-in-three. It has a slim UCI interface which means it can be hooked up to lichess.org via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a> — a bridge between the lichess API and chess bots.</p>
<p>The first speed bump in its development was grasping the computational the complexity of chess — how fast, and wide, the search tree grows. When a chess game starts, white can open in twenty different ways and black can respond in twenty different ways also. After the first full turn, there are 400 variations possible. After the third full turn, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number#Shannon's_calculation">over 119 million</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon calculated that there are around <code>10^120</code> possible games of chess in his seminal paper <em>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</em> in 1950. In <em>Rage Against the Machines</em>, Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/">quotes</a> Diego Rasskin-Gutman, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more possible chess games than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given unlimited resources, it actually doesn’t take many lines of code to calculate every legal variation of chess. Here, the Python package <a href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-chess</a> is used for board representation and legal move generation.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> chess <span>import</span> Board<span>,</span> Move<span>,</span> STARTING_FEN

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        positions<span>[</span>fen<span>]</span> <span>=</span> legal_moves

    <span>for</span> move <span>in</span> legal_moves<span>:</span>
        board<span>.</span>push<span>(</span>move<span>)</span>
        next_fen <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>fen<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        board<span>.</span>pop<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        
        generate_tree<span>(</span>next_fen<span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    generate_tree<span>(</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
<span>except</span> RecursionError<span>:</span> 
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>positions<span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>p<span>)</span> <span>for</span> p <span>in</span> positions<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This program throws a <code>RecursionError</code> and prints <code>59691</code> — the number of different positions the search tree contained when it crashed. All we need to fix this, is another universe to run the program in.</p>
<p>Given that there are computational limits to abide by, as well as the time control rules of chess, improvements over a naive brute force search must be made.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-label="evaluation permalink"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to search for good positions, it is necessary to understand what makes a good position <em>good</em>. The most simplistic way of describing a position’s strength is to compare the total value material of each side.</p>
<p>Tomasz Michniewski, author of the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function">Simplified Evaluation Function</a>, defined some values that are “designed specifically to compensate for the lack of any other chess knowledge”. This is perfect for me — a beginner chess player.</p>
<p>This snippet sums the material on the initial board using Michniewski’s piece values.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> chess

piece_values <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    chess<span>.</span>PAWN<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>

    chess<span>.</span>QUEEN<span>:</span> <span>900</span><span>,</span>
    chess<span>.</span>KING<span>:</span> <span>20000</span>
<span>}</span>

board <span>=</span> chess<span>.</span>Board<span>(</span>chess<span>.</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
white_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
black_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>for</span> square <span>in</span> chess<span>.</span>SQUARES<span>:</span>
    piece <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>piece_at<span>(</span>square<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> piece<span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>
    <span>if</span> piece<span>.</span>color <span>==</span> chess<span>.</span>WHITE<span>:</span>
        white_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        black_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Michniewski also provides <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables">piece-square tables</a>, which alter the value of a piece depending on which square it sits on. For example, it’s better for pawns to progress up the board and it’s better for knights to be near the center of the board.</p>
<p>The bonus of a square may be positive, neutral, or negative. The piece-square tables are presented from White’s POV and must be mirrored for Black.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># a knight's bonuses depending on square
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,
-40,-20,  0,  0,  0,  0,-20,-40,
-30,  0, 10, 15, 15, 10,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 15, 20, 20, 15,  5,-30,
-30,  0, 15, 20, 20, 15,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 10, 15, 15, 10,  5,-30,
-40,-20,  0,  5,  5,  0,-20,-40,
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,</code></pre></div>
<p>For the king, Michniewski provides two tables — one for the middle game and one for the end game. He defines the end game as being either if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both sides have no queens or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every side which has a queen has additionally no other pieces or one minorpiece maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a chess board is one of the things that’s kept me interested in chess engines. Evaluation rules are easy to add and take away. I refactored the code from Go to Python to be able to prototype different rules faster.</p>
<p>After piece-square tables, one might look at pawn structure, mobility, center control, connectivity, trapped pieces, king safety, space, tempo, and other patterns (this list is taken from the Chess Programming Wiki’s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation">Evaluation</a> page).</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-minimax"><a href="#searching-with-minimax" aria-label="searching with minimax permalink"></a>Searching With Minimax</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> is a search algorithm that finds the next optimal move by minimizing the potential loss in a worst case scenario. Chess is a game of perfect information — by looking at the board it’s possible to know exactly what an opponent is capable of. However, this search for moves is limited by the evaluation function and the depth that computing resources are able to reach.</p>
<p>The search space is a tree of legal moves which grows exponentially at every level (the average branching factor is around 35). By the time the tree is explored, the path to many future boards is known as well as which path restricts the opponent’s possible gains the most.</p>
<p>The leaf nodes of the tree return the evaluation of their current state. Non-leaf nodes inherit their value from a descendant node. Eventually, the recursive function reduces down to a value for the given board.</p>
<p>This function can be used to pick the next best move by calling it on every legal move available in the current turn. A great visual resource for this algorithm is Sebastian Lague’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>minimax</span><span>(</span>board<span>,</span> depth<span>,</span> maximizing_player<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<h2 id="alpha-beta-pruning"><a href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-label="alpha beta pruning permalink"></a>Alpha-beta pruning</h2>
<p>My chess engine uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> as an improvement over the naive minimax algorithm — which does not fare well against the exponential nature of chess. Branches of the search tree can be eliminated when it is clear that another branch shows more promise. This significantly reduces the number of moves required to be generated.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/a99200aacf6d6cfc643aaa45317d65aa/42a19/alpha-beta-pruning.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>By reducing the depth of branches that will not bear fruit we can search deeper down the better parts of the tree.</p>
<p>The speed of alpha-beta pruning can be increased by applying <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move ordering</a>. This is where the more promising branches of the search tree are searched first — which means less time is spent in the worst branches as they will be cut off early.</p>
<p>Move ordering cannot be 100% accurate but it’s a powerful optimization.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">my engine</a>, a cheap (but not perfect) <code>move_value</code> function is used to sort the initial legal move nodes from best to worst. The logic of this function is capture in its docstring:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>'''
How good is a move?
A promotion is great.
A weaker piece taking a stronger piece is good.
A stronger piece taking a weaker piece is bad.
Also consider the position change via piece-square table.
'''</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="communication-and-the-uci-protocol"><a href="#communication-and-the-uci-protocol" aria-label="communication and the uci protocol permalink"></a>Communication and the UCI Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma/blob/main/uci-interface.md">Universal Chess Interface</a> (UCI) is a open protocol to hook up chess engines to user interfaces. The communication is done through standard input and standard output and messages end with <code>\n</code>. The move format is long algebraic notation — like <code>e2e4</code>, or <code>e1g1</code> for white short castling, and an example of a promotion to queen is <code>a7a8q</code>.</p>
<p>There are many configuration commands in the specification and it initially seemed overwhelming. After debugging, I found that not many were required to get a chess engine to the <em>Hello World</em> stage.</p>
<p>In order to hook my chess engine up to lichess via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a>, I implemented the following. These commands are send to the engine from lichess-bot:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uci</code> - the engine reports its name, authors, and <code>uciok</code></li>
<li><code>isready</code> - the engine reports that it’s ready: <code>readyok</code></li>
<li><code>position startpos moves e2e4</code> - the engine sets it’s internal state to match the list of moves</li>
<li><code>go</code> - the engine should now calculate and respond with the next best move, like <code>g8f6</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-promise"><a href="#a-promise" aria-label="a promise permalink"></a>A Promise</h2>
<p>I have found a great joy interacting with the chess community over the last month. Lichess is a fantastic resource and endlessly fun to play on. The UI is slick and light — and the post-match analysis is revealing and simple to use. It’s <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila">open source</a> and relies on donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>I took breaks from writing this article to play chess against Dad on a real board. We’re missing a white rook and use a pencil sharpener as a replacement piece. He has been telling me stories about playing chess decades ago — before IBM’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> emerged and beat Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion, on its second attempt in 1997.</p>
<p>If you are within my social circle, you will have experienced me evangelizing chess and chess engines over the last month — now that I have published this, I promise to chill out a little bit ♟️</p>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a href="#other-resources" aria-label="other resources permalink"></a>Other Resources</h2>

<p>Last April, amid the COVID-19 induced panic, Fox News interviewed a doctor about the US government’s response to the epidemic.</p>
<p>But his responses to the questions in the interview didn't go as well as the network was hoping.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the interview went viral. More than 10 million views on Twitter for the 90 second clip.</p>
<p>Before the interview, the doctor, <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiDesaiMD">Rishi Desai</a>, didn't have much of a social media presence. So he created a new account on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/rishi_desai.png" alt="Rishi Desai"></p><p>I still remember watching in disbelief as the account gained over 30 thousand followers in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>No connections, no brand, no tweets, no marketing. Just a viral 90-second video.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dumb Luck</h3>

<p>Of course, "followers" is only a vanity metric. An Instagram model with over 2 million followers <a href="https://www.insider.com/instagrammer-arii-2-million-followers-cannot-sell-36-t-shirts-2019-5">couldn't sell 36 shirts</a> when she launched her brand. A big audience doesn't mean much if they're not engaged. <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 true fans</a> and all that.</p>
<p>But it's mind-boggling how much a viral piece of content can change things.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco">Alex</a> recently got his first $50/mo customer. Excited, he shared the news in a tweet.</p>
<br>
<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got my first $50/mo customer! 🎉</p>— Alex West 🚀 (@alexwestco) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco/status/1252656159636545538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  
<p>The next day, he woke up to hundreds of likes, 1000 new followers, and 10k visitors to his website.</p>
<p>This tweet was an <a href="https://www.alexwest.co/posts/129">inflection point</a> for his business. It put him on the radar, and his business has been on an upward trajectory since.</p>
<p>Why did this particular tweet go viral? There doesn't seem to be any apparent reason. In Alex's words, "luck smiled at me and things went crazy."</p>
<p>This sort of thing happens all the time. A travel blogger's viral Twitter thread that gets her 13k followers. A designer managing to <a href="https://tr.af/6">make six figures</a> in 6 days after a screenshot of his phone goes viral. A <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">blog post</a> that turns into a <a href="https://www.effortlessoutput.com/">side-business</a>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: as lucky as these might seem, this luck didn't come out of thin air.</p>
<p>Alex has been tweeting consistently every day before his viral tweet. Traf has been making and selling designs online for years. Nat has hundreds of articles on his website.</p>
<p>As a wise man once said, "the harder I work, the luckier I get".</p>
<p>Think of it this way: On average, a piece of content does okay relative to your audience. Some might do bad, some might do a little better. And some can go viral.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/not_so_viral_chart.png" alt="Not so viral"></p><p>How do you increase the number of viral content? Simple: you increase the total number of content!</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/viral_chart.png" alt="Viral"></p><p>Shortly after starting his new project, Harry David saw <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/marketing-examples/4700-new-followers-overnight--LyJM6b62tFbqwiW9nLW">a huge uptick</a> in his audience size when Steve Schoger retweeted one of his Twitter threads. But this wasn't Harry's first post – he has been pushing great content for months before that. It was only a matter of time before one of them went viral.</p>
<p>Take consistent action. If you want a viral blog, don't write one post; write 10. If you want to make a sale, don't reach out to 10 prospects; reach out to 100. </p>
<p>Consistency compounds. Wildly so on the internet. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div id="cs-content"><div id="x-section-1"><div><div><div><p>An instruction set architecture (ISA) is crucial to the development of processors and their software ecosystems. In the last half century, the majority of ISAs have been owned by single companies, whether product companies for their own chips/systems or processor IP companies who licensed their processors to chip developers. Does <strong>ISA ownership</strong> matter? Let’s consider three proprietary ISAs and their history.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Alpha ISA was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for its workstations and servers and was released in 1992. In the mid-1990s, this was considered a&nbsp;worthy competitor to SPARC and MIPS RISC architectures. However, the ownership of the ISA transferred to Compaq when DEC was acquired in 1998. Compaq in turn sold the rights to the Alpha ISA to Intel in 2001, and in the same year Compaq was acquired by Hewlett Packard. The last Alpha-based products were released in 2004, meaning that the ISA was effectively dead because of a&nbsp;series of acquisitions.</p>
<p>MIPS Technologies was spun out of Silicon Graphics as an independent IP company in 1998. For some years it enjoyed some success, particularly at the higher end of the processor IP market, and was only the second architecture to have Android ported in 2009. However, with a&nbsp;declining share price, MIPS sold 498 patents to AST and agreed to an acquisition by Imagination Technology in 2013. After Canyon Bridge acquired Imagination, MIPS was spun-out again ending up, after a&nbsp;series of transactions, as part of Wave Computing. As an artificial intelligence silicon provider, Wave is a&nbsp;potential competitor to some MIPS licensees.</p>
<p>Wave tried to encourage the adoption of the MIPS ISA in competition to RISC-V through their MIPS Open Initiative in late 2018. However, the licensing terms contained some onerous conditions relating to patents. In late 2019, Wave suddenly shut down the program, giving zero notice. The important lesson is that even if an ISA is open, its future is not secure if it is commercially owned. Seven years of ownership change have seen MIPS’ market share spiral downwards.</p>
<p>The third example is Arm, the biggest processor IP company of them all. Arm has long been seen as not only a&nbsp;big, successful IP company, but one offering “Swiss neutrality” in the semiconductor industry. Arm was quite distinct from both semiconductor companies and EDA companies. As such, it enjoyed a&nbsp;position of trust from its licensees as it did not have a conflict of interest. With its acquisition by SoftBank in 2016, Arm lost control over its destiny, even though SoftBank was not competing with its licensees. With the planned acquisition of Arm by NVIDIA, announced in September 2020, Arm will lose its neutrality completely. As a&nbsp;semiconductor company, there is a&nbsp;conflict of interest between Arm’s owners and its licensees, meaning it can no longer be trusted in the same way.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the ‘Tale of three ISAs’, the <strong>ownership</strong> of an ISA matters a&nbsp;lot, regardless of whether the ISA is commercially licensed or open. Acquisitions can lead to the disappearance of an ISA through merging of product lines or through making licensing difficult. Another motive for taking over a&nbsp;company can even be to kill off a&nbsp;competing product line, which in the case of an ISA could catastrophically impact licensees.</p>
<p>ISA ownership is one of the key issues that the developers of RISC-V have thought about. By transferring the ownership of the ISA to RISC-V International, the original developers of the ISA have assured its longevity. Longevity is assured both by the <strong>independent ownership of the ISA</strong> and the fact that licensees have a&nbsp;<strong>choice of IP vendors</strong> supporting the same open standard. Thirdly, once ratified, the ISA is <strong>frozen</strong> assuring software developers that their code will be able run on suitable cores indefinitely.</p>

<p><em><strong>Depuis la civilisation, divinités, fêtes et phénomènes naturels sont étroitement corrélés. Le Père Noël est l’aboutissement d’une succession de personnages mythologiques occidentaux dont il conserve encore certains attributs.</strong></em></p>

<p>Le dieu solaire gaulois Belenos porte une hotte et des bottes.</p>



<p>Son successeur, le dieu romain Apollon conduit le char du soleil autour de la terre pour répandre la lumière.</p>



<br>



<h4><strong>De Saint-Nicolas au Père Noël</strong></h4>



<p>En 270 après Jésus Christ Nicolas nait dans la cité de Patara, en Turquie actuelle. Converti jeune au christianisme, il devient évêque de Myre. Les Romains le décapitent un 6 décembre vers 350 après Jésus Christ. Une fontaine d’huile sainte aurait jailli de son cou. Mort en martyr, il est canonisé.</p>



<p>Une légende rapporte qu’en 1087, des moines montrent le tombeau à des soldats croisés originaires d’Italie. Ils ouvrent le cercueil où les ossements baignent dans l’huile. Ils s’en emparent et l’apportent à Bari. Des bonimenteurs profitent de l’histoire pour s’enrichir en vendant une fausse huile sainte guérisseuse à des malades superstitieux.</p>



<p>Au XIIe siècle, Aubert de Varangéville un chevalier de retour de croisade, passe par Bari où il prend «&nbsp;la phalange d’un doigt bénissant&nbsp;». Il l’emporte chez lui à Port en Lorraine, devenue Saint-Nicolas-de-Port.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Le culte du saint grandit et devient très populaire dans l’est et le nord de la France, en Belgique, aux Pays Bas et en Allemagne.</p>



<p>Une des légendes les plus célèbres parle d’un boucher ayant tué trois petits enfants pour les mettre au saloir. Saint Nicolas passant par-là, les ressuscite. Le boucher devient son compagnon, le redouté Père Fouettard, craint des enfants méchants. Ensemble, ils défilent le 6 décembre, accompagnés parfois dit-on en France depuis le&nbsp;XIIe siècle, par un vieillard appelé plus tard «&nbsp;Noël&nbsp;».&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protecteur des écoliers, Saint Nicolas récompense les enfants sages dans la nuit du 5 au 6 décembre. Ils posent leurs souliers devant la cheminée ou devant la porte pour que Saint Nicolas y dépose un cadeau. En retour, les enfants préparent du sucre, du lait et une carotte pour la mule du saint.</p>

<h4><strong>Convergences des genres</strong></h4>



<p>Avec la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9forme_protestante">Réforme</a>, les protestants relèguent les saints pour se concentrer sur les figures principales de la chrétienté. Si l’enfant Jésus, le «&nbsp;<em><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christkindel">Christkindel</a>&nbsp;»</em> parfois représenté par une jeune fille, supplante Saint Nicolas en Allemagne, <em>Sinter Klaas</em> se maintient aux Pays-Bas. Mais le «&nbsp;<em>Christkindel</em>&nbsp;» est trop petit pour conduire le traîneau et trop chétif pour soulever une hotte ou un sac de cadeaux…</p>

<p>Au XVIIIe siècle en Allemagne ressurgissent le petit peuple des&nbsp;fées, des&nbsp;elfes&nbsp;et… le «&nbsp;<em><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihnachtsmann">Weihnachtsmann</a>&nbsp;»</em>, l’homme de Noël, qui se déplace en traîneau offrant des sapins décorés de cadeaux.</p>

<p>Dans les contrées nordiques, c’est le <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisse_(folklore)">nisse</a> ou le tomte, des lutins, qui interviennent à la fête du milieu de l’hiver, la&nbsp;«&nbsp;<em>Midtvintersblo</em>, gratifiant les humains de cadeaux.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="838" height="1024" src="https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/884px-Julbocken_1912-838x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/884px-Julbocken_1912-838x1024.jpg 838w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/884px-Julbocken_1912-246x300.jpg 246w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/884px-Julbocken_1912-768x938.jpg 768w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/884px-Julbocken_1912.jpg 884w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px"><figcaption>Julbocken – John Bauer – 1912</figcaption></figure>



<p>Fin du&nbsp;XVIIe siècle, des gravures anglaises figurent le «&nbsp;<em>Father Christmas</em>&nbsp;», «&nbsp;<em>Sir Christmas</em>&nbsp;» ou «&nbsp;<em>Lord Christmas</em>&nbsp;». À l’instar du Dieu Odin, une longue cape à capuche verte couvre ses épaules et sa tête est ceinte d’une couronne de fleurs, de lierre ou de gui. Passant de maison en maison, il s’invite à table. Lui faire bon accueil garantit un hiver clément.<strong></strong></p>



<p>Vers 1870-1890 en France, le Père Noël est un vieillard chenu dont le manteau est&nbsp;tour à tour vert, bleu, jaune, violet, orange, voire brun. Il passe au rouge juste avant 1914. </p>



<p>Il coexiste avec le maigre et austère «&nbsp;Bonhomme Noël&nbsp;» ou «&nbsp;Père Janvier&nbsp;» couvert de vêtements d’hiver blancs et rouges. Antipathique, il punit les enfants désobéissants à coups de baguettes glissées dans sa ceinture. S’il partage avec Saint Nicolas d’arborer une barbe blanche et de porter parfois une bure, la comparaison s’arrête là.</p>



<p>Simultanément, l’«&nbsp;Enfant Jésus&nbsp;» est bien présent.</p>

<h4><strong>Un personnage de synthèse</strong></h4>



<p>Au XVIIe siècle, Saint Nicolas voyage jusqu’en Amérique avec les colons hollandais. Celui qu’ils appellent <em>Sinterclaes</em> y deviendra <em>Santa Claus</em> puis le <em>Père Noël</em>.</p>



<p>Deux pratiques coexistent, les migrants francophones catholiques s’attachent à l’enfant Jésus, tandis que les anglophones maintiennent la tradition d’un&nbsp;Santa Claus distribuant des cadeaux.</p>



<p>En 1809, pour <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving">Washington Irving</a>, Saint Nicolas est un vieux lutin&nbsp;qui&nbsp;<em>«&nbsp;s’envole au-dessus des arbres dans un chariot volant, transportant ses cadeaux aux enfants&nbsp;».</em></p>



<p>En 1821, dans le livre<em> «&nbsp;Un Cadeau pour le nouvel an aux petits de cinq à douze ans</em>&nbsp;» édité à New York, un poème anonyme parle du «&nbsp;Old Santa Claus&nbsp;».</p>



<p>En 1822, un autre poème édité anonymement et attribué au pasteur américain <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Clarke_Moore">Clement Clarke Moore</a>, «&nbsp;<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas">Une visite de saint Nicolas</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;raconte le&nbsp;<em>«&nbsp;petit vieux gaillard et ventripotent de St Nick&nbsp;»</em> se déplaçant dans un traîneau tiré par huit rennes sur les toits au son des clochettes. Vêtu d’un manteau de fourrure il distribue des cadeaux en passant par la cheminée.</p>



<p>Depuis 1823, on connaît les noms des huit rennes du Père Noël&nbsp;: Tornade, Danseur, Furie, Fringant, Comète, Cupidon, Éclair et Tonnerre. Ils deviennent, dès lors, les sujets de nombreux livres puis plus tard de films d’animations pour les enfants.</p>



<p>En 1939 le poète <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._May">Robert L. May</a> invente l’histoire de <em><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolphe_le_renne_au_nez_rouge">Rudolphe le renne au nez rouge</a></em>.</p>

<h4><strong>Du personnage mythologique à la figure commerciale</strong></h4>



<p>En 1838, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walter_Weir">Robert Walter Weir</a> dessine Saint Nicolas pour la première fois en costume rouge et blanc sous les traits d’un lutin grincheux dont la petite taille lui permet de glisser dans une cheminée.</p>



<p>En 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nast">Thomas Nast</a>, Américain né en Allemagne, publie dans le journal new-yorkais <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Weekly">Harper’s Weekly</a> le dessin en noir et blanc d’un personnage bedonnant, vêtu de fourrure, d’une ceinture noire et d’un bonnet. Il viendrait du pôle Nord, région froide, mystérieuse et alors encore inexplorée. Plus tard ses dessins seront mis en couleur selon les modes du moment.</p>

<p>En 1921, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> colore «&nbsp;Saint Nick&nbsp;» de rouge pour la couverture de<em>&nbsp;The Country Gentleman.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>En 1931, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Sundblom">Haddon Sundblom</a>, Américain d’origine suédoise, dessine pour la société Coca-Cola, le Père Noël à taille humaine tout en lui conservant sa bonhommie, ses rondeurs et sa figure joviale. Pour trouver de nouveaux marchés pour le soda pendant l’hiver américain, la société exporte la boisson vers des pays chauds où la saison estivale bat son plein. C’est ainsi que l’image du Père Noël accompagne avec le soda à travers le monde.</p>



<br>



<h4><strong>Père Noël ou Enfant Jésus, faut-il choisir ?</strong></h4>



<p>Dans l’Europe de l’après-guerre, le Père Noël exaspère les Chrétiens. Le Père Noël commercial a pris le pas sur la célébration de la naissance de Jésus. En 1951 le sujet fait vivement débat en France au point que des politiques de renom débattent. </p>



<p>Le journal<em>&nbsp;La Croix&nbsp;</em>rapporte «&nbsp;une campagne des mouvements catholiques contre le Père Noël&nbsp;»&nbsp;: un curé en brûle une effigie accrochée aux barreaux de la cathédrale de Dijon devant des enfants choqués. La presse fait écho.</p>



<p>L’ultra commercialisation de la fête de Noël depuis la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle fait craindre la perte de sens de la célébration religieuse.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="818" height="1024" src="https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-818x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-818x1024.jpg 818w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-768x962.jpg 768w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-1227x1536.jpg 1227w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair-1635x2048.jpg 1635w, https://www.dalsaceetdailleurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Thetoyfair.jpg 2041w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px"></figure></div>



<p>Mais l’anthropologue <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a> défend le Père Noël qu’il considère comme la «&nbsp;divinité d’une classe d’âge&nbsp;» . </p>



<p>La psychanalyste <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Dolto">Françoise Dolto</a> insiste sur l’utilité du Père Noël. Pour elle, le moment de la démystification du personnage est un rite de passage d’un âge vers un autre. Elle est d’ailleurs soutenue dans sa conviction par son frère, ministre de <a href="https://www.laposte.fr/lettre-pere-noel">la Poste</a> qui lui confie en 1962 la tâche de mettre en place une carte-réponse type pour répondre aux enfants qui écrivent au Père Noël. Depuis si le système s’est modernisé, il existe toujours, en France comme ailleurs. Ici <a href="https://pere-noel.laposte.fr/">le Secrétariat</a> du Père Noël français, là, <a href="https://www.laposte.fr/lettre-pere-noel">la lettre-type</a> à envoyer par la Poste française.</p>



<p>Il existe, en Laponie, <a href="https://santaclausvillage.info/fr/">le village du Père Noël</a>. L’occasion d’un fabuleux voyage dans une contrée extrême où le frisson du grand froid le dispute à l’excitation de vivre un rêve d’enfant.</p>



<p>Dans un monde en quête de sens, mais où petits et grands s’attachent à des personnages fictifs aux figures sympathiques et où le commerce se veut divertissement pour mieux séduire, gageons que le Père Noël a encore de beaux jours devant lui.</p>

<p>This story is a bit long, but I promise it will be worth it, because it contains the two most important principles every designer must know and take to heart if you intend to do great work anywhere, under almost any circumstances, over the long, long haul of your career.</p>



<h2>The Bronze Age of me</h2>



<p>Early in my career, before the web, when I was in advertising, I had the good fortune to work for legendary creative directors. They’d amassed so many awards in their careers that, in the event of Apocalypse, they could have melted their shiny trophies down and lived off the barter value of the metal.</p>



<p>These old men were giants who had once strode the halls of famous agencies, but ours was not famous—at least not for being good. It was a reeking quagmire where great ideas went to die.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our company knew it had a problem, so it kept hiring brilliant creative leaders, paying them to inspire us demoralized and underpaid young art directors and copywriters, and pitting us against an internal culture that had been designed quite carefully to neutralize and kill the kind of work our ever-changing cast of overlords challenged us to create.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Let me unpack that.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our clients were makers of aspirin and ointments. They owned financially successful chain restaurants. If it ached, if it bled, if it could be satisfied with heaping plates of deeply fried or sauce-drowned food-like products at a family-friendly low price, we probably handled its advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of advertising, painstakingly crafted to offend no one, and baited with jingles that stick, unwanted, in the mind, works chiefly by being shown so many times that it can’t help but lodge in the collective consciousness and inexorably drive sales. Think McDonald’s, but smaller and less … glamorous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saturation is the name of the game, and the agency (like others of its kind) made its money by taking a commission on media placement.&nbsp;<em>Creative was something we gave away free.</em> All we wanted was a cut of the fee broadcasters charged to run the stuff.</p>



<h2>Fear of a creative planet</h2>



<p>A great ad—one people talked about, one that potentially risked offending a few people—would destroy the cozy and lucrative business relationships on which the agency was founded. The company knew it, and hired skilled account executives to prevent even a moderately good idea from ever reaching the airwaves.</p>



<p><em>But…</em></p>



<p>Creative advertising was much talked-about in the popular culture of the time, and our clients asked for it even though they wouldn’t have bought it to save their children’s lives. So the agency occasionally had to show a good idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, we young art directors and copywriters were idealists, and the agency wasn’t paying us enough to buy our loyalty. They <em>might</em> have distributed the profits more equitably, but the account executives had houses in Darien and ex-spouses to support, so they couldn’t afford to waste any of that money on the troops who did the work the whole thing ran on.</p>



<p>Hence every six months the company hired new creative directors who, we grunts thought, would finally “turn this place around” and allow us to do the kind of work we dreamed of.</p>



<p>This is how our company came to hire legendary award winners. And although we never sold a great ad, the lesson I learned from them turned out to be the second most important guiding principle of my work as a designer. The first, most important principle, of course, is listen to the customer. But this other principle comes a close second.</p>



<p>The principle these creative directors taught me, chiefly by how they acted, was…</p>



<h2>Never give up.</h2>



<p>Never stop trying to do great work. Never get demoralized. Never stop caring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It sounds simple. It isn’t.</p>



<p>I watched these creative directors and their partners work all night to produce a great idea in spite of all the constraints around the client and product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I watched them enthusiastically present great work internally. Watched the internal folks sabotage it through fear. Watched my leaders cheerfully go back to the drawing board and come up with something new by the next morning.</p>



<p>I watched them enact this ritual a half-dozen times before the work even got shown to the clients.</p>



<p>I watched the clients shoot it down. I watched my leaders cheerfully get up, put their materials away, come back to the agency, and start over.</p>



<p>Never, not once, did they dial it in. Never did they just shrug their shoulders and say, “Fine, I’ll give these people what they want.” They listened to the customer but the customer didn’t dictate. The customer’s business problem dictated the creative solution. The solution would work if the customer bought it. If the customer didn’t buy, well, there was another great creative solution out there, if you just worked hard enough to find it.</p>



<p>Even in those extremely backwards times, there were great women creative directors out there, too—but our agency never hired one, so I only got to meet these men.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were old men—one of them, who leaned forward with a hunch, and always walked as if he were in pain—looked like Moses. I swear he stared through my soul when I tried to go home before 8:00 PM. (We worked in offices then, and you never went home before your boss.) He scared me but I liked him.</p>



<div><p>Once I asked if he missed the “great” clients he had worked for in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>“Great clients?”</p><p>“Like Volkswagen.”</p></div>



<p>“They killed just as many good ads as these guys do.”</p>



<p>“What did you do?”</p>



<p>“Came up with more ads.”</p>



<p>The ability to keep coming up with more ads was why this Moses-looking dude had a roomful of shiny trophies, and I did not. If I wanted a career like his, I would have to seek deeply in my soul for the strength and willingness not to give up.</p>



<p>Career aside,<em>&nbsp;if I wanted to create meaningful work,</em>&nbsp;I would need to develop the patience and willingness to watch people kill my darlings, and come back with newer, fresher, better darlings.</p>







<p>I have not done it perfectly, not by a long shot. But keeping a positive attitude when an idea I’ve fallen in love with gets rejected remains the second most important thing I can do on a daily basis as I practice my current craft.</p>



<p>Both product work and client work are tough. The challenges can seem overwhelming. We bang our heads. We weep. Finally, we and our teammates come up with a solution. This is it! We’ve done it! Joyfully, we share it. Our lead shoots holes in it. Maybe because it runs afoul of some important learning we didn’t know about. Or because it was tried before we got here and tested badly. Or, sometimes, because they just don’t like it.</p>



<p>We come back with three ideas and none of them are quite right, either.</p>



<p>So we go back and work harder and come up with new stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The well is never dry. We only run out of ideas when we choose to stop doing the work.</p>



<p>The designers I work with here today inspire me on many levels. Their energy, their talent, their sheer skill impresses me. But what blows me away most of all, is that the really good designers stand up to the misfortune of a killed idea. They take away the lesson of what went wrong, and come back with something that much stronger. Or, if not stronger, something different but equally good.</p>



<p>Never give up.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>This article was inspired by a conversation I had with one of our designers, after watching her respond graciously and positively while working on a tough project.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Every few years there comes a technology that people get hyped about, everyone wants to be a specialist in that field because it appears to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Between 2015-2019 this was largely about bitcoins and blockchain technology. Everyone wanted to be a specialist in blockchain technology. Bitcoin was booming, ICOs were happening to the left and right.</p>
<p>And people were trying to introduce/incorporate blockchain technology into everything they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>Yes sometimes blockchain technology can improve the existing system. However, when you try to introduce blockchain or any other technology into something that doesn’t require it,the results can be disastrous.</p>
<p>This is a story I wanted to write for a very long time, it was about a small startup called BlockEvent. A small startup that wanted to incorporate blockchain technology into event management.</p>
<p><em>Their website blockevent.tk is now not functioning, and I was unable to find a web archive snapshot. A mirror exists on a different domain, please check the footnotes.</em></p>
<p>Blockchain on event management has been there before BlockEvents. Smart ticketing and smart contracts are currently being used to improve the ticketing field and control pricing etc.</p>
<h2>BlockEvent</h2>
<p>BlockEvents wanted to make the whole event process a decentralized mechanism. From user data, to events, to registration, everything was supposed to be “decentralized” and was “not accessible” to and “not modifiable” by anyone.</p>
<p>According to the BlockEvent team, </p>
<blockquote><p>We made BlockEvent as a decentralized system. That means no central party can control this booking process and it will work without any third party involvement. </p><p>BlockEvent acts as a bridge between the organizers and the participants where organizers come and create events through our system, and participants can come and book their tickets. </p><p>The whole process is done through Public Blockchain.</p><p>… </p><p>Using the blockchain for user identity management is a whole new paradigm.</p><cite>BlockEvent on one of their Facebook posts, describing their system. </cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent when initially started mainly hosted monthly blockchain event meetup events. However, their big break came in May 2019, during the annual Google I/O.</p>
<p>Google I/O event is celebrated in Sri Lanka every year, with local tech companies hosting events of their own, with local influencers, while live streaming the Google I/O event.</p>
<p>The selection process is a very completions, hundreds of people compete for few limited number of seats. These events are a good place to network and meet new friends in IT field. Plus you end up getting some cool swags.</p>
<p>In order to be selected to these events you need to show that you are a tech person, usually they check your GitHub page, blog or YouTube channel. And the tech company will select and send an invitation to whom they think are the most suitable to attend their events.</p>
<p>Until 2018, this was done by using a simple Google form or a regular website.</p>
<p>However, in 2019, one of the largest tech and telecom companies in Sri Lanka decided to use BlockEvents to host their Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Getting selected by a big company like them to manage their Google I/O event was big deal, because they host one of the largest I/O events in Sri Lanka. And BlockEvent can leverage this to opportunity to get bigger clients in future.</p>
<p>It was their make or break moment. They had to nail it, and if they failed then for a small startup like BlockEvent, the damage to their reputation is going to hurt them to a point where there is no return.</p>
<h2><strong>Disaster</strong> </h2>
<p>BlockEvent also in their description, said this,</p>
<blockquote><p>To ensure the user data privacy and security, <strong>we are not storing any user credentials or password</strong>[s] <strong>in our database. Even the user emails are stored as a hash. Only the users know their passwords </strong>and that will provide 100% control over your account actions. Even BlockEvent team can’t access your accounts. </p><cite>BlockEvent describing their system in a Facebook post</cite></blockquote>
<p>Since they were storing <strong>everything </strong>in the blockchain, they were not storing even user emails and passwords. This may sound as a good privacy focused system. But this will come to hurt BlockEvent in a very bad way.</p>
<p>Since no one else other than the people in monthly blockchain meetups knew about BlockEvents, like in any other new service, most people registering for the local Google I/O event used either throwaway passwords, or new passwords which they forgot or didn’t save.</p>
<p>This caused large number of people to forget their passwords. If we use a normal database to store user data, with no hashing, they would have been able to reset the user passwords.</p>
<p>However, since everything is stored in blockchain, and everything were hashed, this meant that there is no way to reset a user password. </p>
<p>This led to large number of people being locked out of their accounts, unable to create new accounts with the existing emails, and BlockEvent team unable to reset passwords.</p>
<p>This caused a wave of negative reviews on BlockEvent Facebook page and on social media. Some users demanded the organizers to go back to the old system of using a Google form for user registration.</p>
<p>BlockEvent finally responded to their users, they had no way to reseat the password. Unless you remember the password and login, or you are permanently locked out from using the account.</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to the rules of decentralization, we can’t reset your passwords as we are giving priority to user data and security. We already communicated this on registration [on sign up]. </p><p>To ensure the decentralization the same rule is applied by many other [b]lockchain projects and products all over the world.</p><cite>BlockEvent responding to the events on a Facebook page</cite></blockquote>
<p>BlockEvent also asked participants to send their personal details on Facebook and via a Google form, so they can manually arrange a way to send the gift pack to the participants.</p>
<p>Some of the users accused the selection process was also flawed and complained that some of the people who were less qualified to attend the event were selected over them.</p>
<p>All this led to irreplaceable damage on BlockEvent, and the Google I/O event didn’t happen due to the Easter Sunday bombings. </p>
<p>BlockEvent went into hiatus few months later, all thought they never mentioned that they are shutting down, their website went offline once their domain name expired. Possibly signaling the end of the startup that hoped to decentralize how we manage identity online.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong> </h2>
<p>The title of the post is <strong>“Somethings are never meant to be invented”</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how utopian the idea may sound like, guaranteeing 100% user privacy with everything stored on a blockchain, not even giving access to user email to the creators can have its own drawbacks.</p>
<p>And since we are all humans, and we all tend to make mistakes, there has to be a fail safe mechanism, that will keep things in check and can undo the mistakes when we make one.</p>
<p>Also a single use password is a very bad idea, not only that users can lose their passwords, but also in the event of a data breach, user handing over the password to a third party by a mistake, how can the service reset the passwords? There are so many scenarios where things can go wrong.</p>
<p>May be an idea like BlockEvent were never meant to be invented.</p>
<p><strong>The currently hyped up technology may not be ideal for your system and instead a time tested solution may be the answer that you’re looking for.</strong></p>
<h2>My thoughts</h2>
<p>When it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, I’m still open minded, at the same time but skeptical. I’m not yet ready to invest or build something on blockchain.</p>
<p>I still find it difficult to fully understand the idea of blockchain, what makes it different from a decentralized git repository? Why Git is easy to implement but blockchain is hard? </p>
<p>When it comes to BlockEvents, I think what they did was store the email and password both hashed on the blockchain, and when a user logs in, they match the submitted hashed email and hashed passwords against what’s stored in the blockchain, like we do it in a normal login system using a database, except the fact that we don’t hash the emails.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p><em>I’m not a blockchain expert, so I don’t know the exact reason why BlockEvent was not able to reset the passwords.</em></p>
<p><em>Was it because they didn’t know the emails because they were hashed, or was it because once you put some information to the blockchain it is immutable, or was it due to both?</em></p>
<p><em>At the time when I saw this in 2019, I thought it was due to the fact that data is immutable on the blockchain, but now at the time of writing I feel it was due to the fact that the emails were stored on the blockchain in hashed format.</em></p>
<p><em>I also don’t know what really caused so many people to lose their password, my assumption is that they used a throwaway password, or a new password which they forgot. But still this number of users getting locked out is still unexplained.</em></p>
<p><em>After further Googling I was able to find a mirror of the original website on another domain name http://blockevent.ml</em></p>
<p><em>I tried logging in using my BlockEvent account, but I also have forgotten my BlockEvent password, and now I’m also locked out.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Law enforcement wiretapped the very service used by criminals to evade interception</p><div><p>The virtual private network (VPN) Safe-Inet used by the world’s foremost cybercriminals has been taken down yesterday in a coordinated law enforcement action led by the German Reutlingen Police Headquarters together with Europol and law enforcement agencies from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Safe-Inet service was shut down and its infrastructure seized in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and the United States. The servers were taken down, and a splash page prepared by Europol was put up online after the domain seizures. This coordinated takedown was carried out in the framework of the <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact">European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Turning the table on the criminals&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Active for over a decade, Safe-Inet was being used by some of the world’s biggest cybercriminals, such as the ransomware operators responsible for ransomware, E-skimming breaches and other forms of serious cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This VPN service was sold at a high price to the criminal underworld as one of the best tools available to avoid law enforcement interception, offering up to 5 layers of anonymous VPN connections.</p>
<p>Law enforcement were able to identify some 250 companies worldwide which were being spied on by the criminals using this VPN. These companies were subsequently warned of an imminent ransomware attack against their systems, allowing them to take measures to protect themselves against such an attack.<br>
The service has now been rendered inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigations are ongoing in a number of countries to identify and take action against some of Safe-Inet’s users. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cyber sweep&nbsp;</h3>
<p>International police cooperation was central to the success of this investigation as the critical infrastructure was scattered across the world.</p>
<p>Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) </a>supported the investigation from the onset, bringing together all the involved countries to establish a joint strategy and to organise the intensive exchange of information and evidence needed to prepare for the final phase of the takedown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Police President of the Reutlingen Police Headquarters, Udo Vogel</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investigation carried out by our cybercrime specialists has resulted in such a success thanks to the excellent international cooperation with partners worldwide. The results show that law enforcement authorities are equally as well connected as criminals.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Edvardas Šileris</strong>, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &nbsp;strong working relationship fostered by Europol between the investigators involved in this case on either side of the world was central in bringing down this service. &nbsp;Criminals can run but they cannot hide from law enforcement, and we will continue working tirelessly together with our partners to outsmart them.</p>

            <!-- //category -->


            <p><a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/datafusion" title="DataFusion">DataFusion</a> is a new data processing engine written in the Rust programming language. It provides a SQL and a DataFrame API to transform datasets from multiple sources and in multiple file formats, similar to Spark. DataFusion uses <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/" title="Apache Arrow">Apache Arrow</a> as the underlying memory model, an efficient in-memory columnar format. This choice has significant performance benefits compared to a row-level representation such as used by <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" title="Apache Spark">Apache Spark</a>.</p>
<p>As other databases &amp; engines have shown, performing analytical (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing" title="OLAP">OLAP</a>) queries on a <a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2005/papers/P19.pdf" title="columnar rather than row-by-row format">columnar rather than row-by-row format</a> can significantly speed up query execution, often by 20x or more!  When processing is done row-by-row, a lot of complex operations are being executed in the inner loop when executing a query, such as interpreting an expression, computing the result and going to the next value in the row, dealing with completely different operations and data types. In contrast, when operating on a columnar level, the inner loop can be very simple, making it easy for the CPU to see what instructions will likely run next and utilize various forms of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism" title="instruction level parallelism">instruction level parallelism</a>. Modern CPUs can run hundreds of instructions at the same time, even on one core. Code can be written to use available <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD" title="SIMD">SIMD</a> instructions, operating at multiple inputs at the same time to speed up things even more.<img src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/simd.png" alt="Arrow Format" title="Arrow Format"></p>
<p><em>Image source: Arrow website</em></p>
<p>DataFusion is implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" title="Rust">Rust</a>, a language that is both fast and has control over memory while still providing memory safety, making it a very suitable language to write performant and correct code. Compared to Java running on the JVM, systems written in Rust tend to use much less memory. This saves costs and makes it possible to run bigger workloads on a single machine! An earlier benchmark of <a href="https://ballistacompute.org/" title="Ballista">Ballista</a>, a distributed engine in Rust utilizing DataFusion, <a href="https://andygrove.io/rust_bigdata_benchmarks/" title="shows">shows</a> that it can do with about 10x less memory on small to medium sized datasets. The JVM needs at least 1 GB for the heap. Spark also keeps intermediate results in memory between stages. DataFusion can stream more in batches of records, keeping memory usage low. DataFusion also benefits from Arrow format, which stores data types such as strings in an efficient way.</p>
<p>Numerous performance improvements have been added in the Rust version of Arrow and DataFusion between version 2 and 3 which is planned for release in January.<br>
For example, I have contributed a<a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8781" title=" faster CSV parser"> faster CSV parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8863" title="improved">improved</a> the performance of <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8832" title="hashing">hashing</a>. Kernels have been improved that provide implementations of often-used calculations, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8800" title="sum">sum</a>, filter, <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8803" title="taking multiple elements">taking multiple elements</a> of an array by index (also called indexing or gathering), and <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8837" title="more">more</a>. As DataFusion and Arrow are relatively new projects, there is still a lot of room for further improvement.</p>
<p>Recently, I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8961" title="added a new optimization pass to">added a new optimization pass to</a> DataFusion to make hash joins faster. A hash join is a popular algorithm to implement joins in a fast way. The hash join algorithm is divided in a <em>build</em> stage and a <em>probe</em> stage. The <em>build</em> (or left side) stage creates a lookup table to map the keys in the join condition to a row index. The <em>probe</em> (right side) stage looks up the items in the lookup table by key and adds the matching rows to the end result if there is a match.<br>
It is faster to create a lookup table for the smallest table. This will avoid work for creating the lookup table for more rows, as well as not having the requirement to keep the bigger table in memory. For the optimization to be possible, we need to know the number of rows of both sources before executing the query. Luckily, for Parquet and in-memory tables this can be calculated based on the metadata. This information has been exposed recently in DataFusion.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-results">Implementation / Results</h4>
<p>The optimization is implemented as an optimization pass on the logical plan, an abstract representation of a query. When the left side of a join has more rows than the right side, the order and join type are swapped. If the left side already is smaller, the order is kept intact.<br>
While testing the optimization something unexpected happened: When the optimization rule was used to change the order, the query performed worse than the original.<br>
While studying the implementation of the hash join in DataFusion, it became clear that next to the left side of a join, the right part creates a lookup table as well!<br>
I <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/8965" title="changed the implementation">changed the implementation</a> to only use the probe side to look up items on the left side and simplified the implementation, removing some other inefficiencies. Now queries having joins run much faster than before. This can be demonstrated on two <a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpch/" title="TCP-H">TCP-H</a> benchmark queries that include a join and are supported in DataFusion. Notably, TCP-H 5 is now 16x faster and TCP-H 12 more than 4 times faster.<br>
I ran the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/benchmarks" title="TPC-H">TPC-H</a> benchmarks using the command: <code>cargo run  --release --bin tpch -- benchmark --iterations 10 --path <location> --format tbl --query 12 --batch-size 20000 --concurrency 10 -m </location></code> and averaged the results.</p>
<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/improved_join-900x629.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the optimization rule is applied and combined with the improved hash join implementation, it makes the queries where the rule can be applied run faster, in this case reducing the total execution time by about 16%. For more imbalanced joins, the speedup can be greater. The data contains roughly 6 million line items (originally on the left side of the join) and 1.5 million orders (on the right side).</p>

<p><img src="https://godatadriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/join_build_probe_order-900x542.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Statistics are a promising way to accelerate queries. In the future, a lot more optimizations could be added that benefit from table statistics. Many statistics however are known only after queries run, so in the future it would be interesting to add a form of <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/05/29/adaptive-query-execution-speeding-up-spark-sql-at-runtime.html" title="Adaptive Query Execution">Adaptive Query Execution</a> as well.<br>
Hash joins could be further improved, for example by using <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/vectorized-hash-joiner/" title="vectorized hashing">vectorized hashing</a>, which can also be used for hash aggregations which are used in GROUP BY queries.</p>
<p>I am personally very excited for what the future of Arrow and DataFusion brings and making Rust and Apache Arrow accelerate data analytics &amp; data science.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>In the <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">previous post</a>, I described a simple way to think about matrices, namely as bipartite graphs. Today I'd like to share a different way to picture matrices—one which is used not only in mathematics, but also in physics, chemistry, and machine learning. Here's the basic idea. An $m\times n$ matrix $M$ with real entries represents a linear map from $\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$. Such a mapping can be pictured as a node with two edges. One edge represents the input space, the other edge represents the output space.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c18ee025347a27a32481_node.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>That's it!</p><p>We can accomplish much with this simple idea. But first, a few words about the picture: To specify an $m\times n$ matrix $M$, one must specify all $mn$ entries $M_{ij}$. The index $i$ ranges from 1 to $m$—the dimension of the output space—and the index $j$ ranges from 1 to $n$—the dimension of the input space. Said differently, $i$ indexes the number of rows of $M$ and $j$&nbsp;indexes the number of its columns. These indices can be included in the picture, if we like:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cdaa5a8312b3a44ecb44278_Mij.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>This idea generalizes very easily. A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, while an $n$-dimensional array of numbers is called a <strong>tensor of order $n$</strong> or an $n$-<strong>tensor</strong>. Like a matrix, an $n$-tensor can be &nbsp;represented by a node with one edge for each dimension.</p><p>A number, for example, can be thought of as a zero-dimensional array, i.e. a point. It is thus a 0-tensor, which can be drawn as a node with <em>zero</em> edges. Likewise, a vector can be thought of as a <em>one</em>-dimensional array of numbers and hence a 1-tensor. It's represented by a node with <em>one </em>edge. A matrix is a <em>two</em>-dimensional array and hence 2-tensor. It's represented by a node with <em>two</em> edges. A 3-tensor is a <em>three</em>-dimensional array and hence a node with <em>three</em> edges, and so on.</p><figure id="w-node-27a904484310-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd99a73f8ce4494ad86852e_arraychart.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this graphical notation, familiar things have nice pictures. For example...</p><h3><strong>Matrix multiplication is tensor contraction.</strong></h3><p>Multiplying two matrices corresponds to "glueing" their pictures together. This is called tensor <strong>contraction</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-0b127d2e466c-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c1cae025346888a363e5_mult.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the picture above, the edges with matching indices $j$ were the ones that were contracted. This is consistent with the fact that two matrices can be multiplied only when their input/output dimensions match up. You'll also notice that the resulting picture has two free indices, $i$ and $k$, which indeed defines a matrix.</p><p><strong>‍</strong>By the way, a key feature of having these pictures is that we don't have to carry around indices. So let's not!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c1e80208a6476b30f327_mult2.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>A quick check: A&nbsp;matrix was described as a <em>single </em>node with one edge for each vector space, yet the picture above has <em>two</em> nodes. We still want this to represent a <em>single</em> matrix.&nbsp;And I claim it does!&nbsp;There's a nice way to see this: simply smoosh the blue and green nodes together.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c27e03764fbf94b64409_mult3.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>This reminds me of rain trickling down a window: when two raindrops come into contact, they fuse into bigger droplet. That's matrix-matrix multiplication. A similar picture holds for matrix-vector multiplication:&nbsp;a matrix $M$&nbsp;multiplied by a vector $\mathbf{v}$ results in another vector $M\mathbf{v}$, which is a node with one free edge.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd99bab91c3d7662087429d_Mv.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>More generally, the product of two or more tensors is represented by a cluster of nodes and edges where the contractions occur along edges with matching indices.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd99bffc370fa3fc0756ede_TN.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h3>‍<strong>Node shapes can represent different properties.</strong></h3><p>So far I've drawn all the nodes as circles. But this was just a choice. There is no official rule for which shape to use. That means we can be creative! For example, we might want to reserve a circle or other symmetric shape, like a square, for <em>symmetric</em> matrices only.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8be6091c3d7f6e5487d7e_notsym.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Then the <em>transpose </em>of a matrix can be represented by reflecting its picture:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8be69c3d075631a5fe753_tranpose.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>So the symmetry of a symmetric matrix is preserved in the diagram!</p><figure id="w-node-bef31dc22539-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8be5503764fd9b8b592a6_symmetric.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>I&nbsp;also like the idea of drawing isometric embeddings as triangles:</p><figure id="w-node-aa68c59a594a-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c13ae02534421aa30e9b_isometry1.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>An isometric embedding $U$&nbsp;is a linear map from a space $V$&nbsp;into a space $W$ of larger dimension that preserves the lengths of vectors.<strong> </strong>Such a map satisfies $U^\top U=\text{id}_V$ but $UU^\top \neq \text{id}_W$. In words, you can always embed the small space $V$ into a larger one, then project back onto $V$ without distorting the vectors in $V$. (Not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retract">retraction map</a> in topology.) But you certainly <em>can't</em> squish all of $W$ onto little $V$, then expect to undo the damage after including $V$ back into $W$. This large-versus-small feature is hinted at by the triangles. (The base of a triangle is larger than its tip!) And in general, as shown below, identity linear operators are drawn as straight lines:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c1325dcff22ae46c5494_isometry.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Matrix factorizations have nice pictures, too.</strong></h3><p>With all this talk of matrix multiplication, i.e. matrix composition, let's not forget about matrix factorization, i.e. matrix <em>de</em>composition! Every matrix, for example, has a <a href="https://jeremykun.com/2016/04/18/singular-value-decomposition-part-1-perspectives-on-linear-algebra/">singular value decomposition</a>. This has a nice picture associated to it:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cdc15cb6a203e5ca33a3fb1_SVD.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here, $U$&nbsp;and $V$&nbsp;are unitary matrices, and hence isometries, and hence triangles. The matrix $D$&nbsp;is a diagonal matrix, which I like to represent by a diamond. In short, matrix factorization is the decomposition of a single node into multiple nodes; matrix multiplication is the fusion of multiple nodes into a single node.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cdc300c04fb87fb1aeb9854_duo.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>The drawing above illustrates another feature of these diagrams:&nbsp;the spatial position of the nodes doesn't really matter. I could've drawn the yellow, blue, green, and pink nodes in horizontal line, or in a vertical line, or in a zig-zag, or however I wish. The only important thing is that the diagram has two free edges. The product of matrices is another matrix!</p><h3><strong>Messy proofs reduce to picture proofs.</strong></h3><p>There's more we could say about this graphical notation, but I'll wrap up with another noteworthy feature: proofs can become very simple! Take the trace, for example. The trace of a matrix has a simple picture. It's defined to be the sum along a common index:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c42291c3d71260494990_trace.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>This string-with-a-bead has no free edges. It's a loop. This is consistent with the fact that the trace is a <em>number. </em>It's a 0-tensor so it has no free indices. Now here's a proof that the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations:</p><figure id="w-node-f919cf76bde4-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5cd8c56ef8ce44ea434b641b_proof.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Just slide beads along a necklace. So clean!</p><h3><strong>What's in a name?</strong>‍</h3><p>The diagrams discussed in today's post, which have their origins in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_graphical_notation">Penrose's graphical notation</a>, are called <strong>tensor network diagrams </strong>and/or, perhaps with some minor differences, <strong>string diagrams</strong>. The "and/or" depends on who you are<em>.</em> That is, the idea to visually represent a map-of-vector-spaces as a node-with-edges is used in the physics/machine learning communities, where they are called <em>tensor network diagrams, </em>and also in the category theory community, where they are called <em>string diagrams</em>. I think this is just a case of different fields using nearly identical notation for different purposes.</p><p>Category theorists use string diagrams to <em>prove</em> things. (The diagrams appear in my little booklet on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05923">applied category theory</a>, for instance.) What's more, string diagrams are used to represent most any kind of mapping—not just mappings between vector spaces. Said more formally, string diagrams might arise in a discussion of any <em>monoidal category</em>. For a gentle introduction to these categorical ideas, check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316">Seven Sketches</a> by Fong and Spivak as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Picturing-Quantum-Processes-Diagrammatic-Reasoning/dp/110710422X">Picturing Quantum Processes </a>by Coecke and Kissinger.</p><p>Some physicists and machine learning researchers, on the other hand, use tensor networks to <em>compute</em> things. A typical situation may go something like this. You have a quantum system. You wish to find the main eigenvector of a special linear operator, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)">Hamiltonian.</a> This eigenvector lives in an absurdly large Hilbert space, so you want a technique to find this vector in a compressed kind of way. Enter: tensor networks. </p><p>And by "absurdly large," I&nbsp;do mean ABSURDLY large. If you have an Avogadro's number's worth of quantum particles, each of which can occupy just two states, then you need a vector space of dimension $2^{10^{23}}$. Now imagine having a linear operator on this space. That's a matrix with $2^{10^{23}}\times 2^{10^{23}}$ entries. That is <em>exponentially</em> more than the number of atoms in the observable universe. There are only $10^{80}$ of those! Good luck storing this on a computer. In summary, tensor networks help us deal with a large number of parameters in a principled, tractable way.</p><p>Tensor networks also have much overlap with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01437">graphical models</a>, automata, and more.&nbsp;One vein of current research is identifying and making good use of those overlaps. So there's a lot to explore here. A few places to start are Miles Stoudenmire's <a href="http://itensor.org/">iTensor library</a>, Roman Orus's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2164">A Practical Introduction to Tensor Networks</a>, Jacob Biamonte's and Ville Bergholm's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00006">Tensor Networks in a Nutshell</a>, and Google's <a href="https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork">TensorNetwork library</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>I’ve been working on a project (with some excellent researchers who first introduced me to the tensor network world) that uses these diagrams in a more computational/physics-y setting. For that reason, I tend to think of them as tensor network diagrams, rather than as string diagrams. </p><p>The project, which features a special kind of tensor network, has some really neat mathematics that I'm excited to share. It also uses the <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">matrices-as-graphs</a> idea discussed on the blog previously. I plan to blog about it <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/modeling-sequences-with-quantum-states">later in the year.</a> </p><p>Stay tuned!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>New! </strong>[Added October 20, 2019] You can see some of today's ideas <em>in action </em>in "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07425">Modeling Sequences with Quantum States</a>" (arXiv:1910.07425). There, we make frequent use of tensor network diagrams, especially in the description of a certain training algorithm.

                    <div>
                <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p><span>Over the last many years, analytical dashboards have proliferated enterprises from the boardroom to the manufacturing line. As businesses have become increasingly more reliant on analytics, end users have started to demand snappier performance from their dashboards. Gone are the days that visualizations are used simply for historical data. Data professionals are now using them for predictive and prescriptive analytics on petabytes of information, expecting the most real-time insights to tell their data stories.</span></p>
<p><span>Many organizations across consumer products, healthcare, fintech and other verticals have been met with the challenge of slow moving BI applications in recent years, due to the growth of data and many new types of users. Backend platforms are often retooled for each use case and still are unable to handle the growing concurrency demands of the business. This leads to applications that take too long to render and users that are faced with the dreaded “loading” pinwheel.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Pain</b></h2>
<p><span>The challenge of slow-running dashboards is not limited to legacy systems. Users experience slow dashboards when their applications are backed by legacy architectures as well as by more modern database systems.&nbsp;</span><span>The pain points that enterprises face with legacy architectures start with the original intent of those systems: to support historical reporting and batch-oriented dashboards. Many databases from vendors like Oracle were built around a different era of business demands — when operational decisions were not made through data visualization. Over time, other (now legacy) systems like SQL Server emerged to help with transactional processing of data. This spread of new database systems purpose-built by workload introduced put even more stress on ETL technologies. The Hadoop era aimed to solve this, but ultimately consumers were left at the mercy of too many different systems for data to reside in and excessive data duplication across those silos. This made data storytelling very difficult.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Challenge of Legacy Architectures</span></p>
<p><span>The struggle with legacy data systems has been even further exposed with the emergence of streaming data. Data is now being unlocked from chatty systems like e-commerce systems, financial trades, and oil and gas machinery. Real-time data pipelines from messaging infrastructures like Kafka, Kinesis, Pulsar and others have put an even greater burden on old, slow databases. Users expect the data from these applications to be readily available in real-time and operational dashboards, often combined with historical reference data. Instead, they end up stuck with dashboards struggling to load data for critical business decisioning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2.png" alt="" width="2880" height="1220" srcset="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2.png 2880w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-300x127.png 300w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-1024x434.png 1024w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-768x325.png 768w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-1536x651.png 1536w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-2048x868.png 2048w, https://www.singlestore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/diagram_2-1070x453.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px"></p>
<p><span>Introducing Streaming Data</span></p>
<p><span>The challenges that legacy data platforms faced in the face of the growing base of analytics users has been met with the advent of modern data platforms. These platforms tout a new focus toward analytics, AI and machine learning. While modern data platforms still tend to specialize in OLTP or OLAP workloads, data platform vendors are adding even further delineation on the lines of data type — MongoDB specializes in document data, Redis for key-value data, etc. This approach works very well for application data that can often be unstructured and transactional. However, tying together multiple single-purpose databases for a unified visual experience remains extremely slow, and thus data stories end up very disjointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cloud data warehouses have started to solve this problem, but scaling to satisfy an enterprise-scale analytics audience and handling operational data with platforms like Snowflake has proven to be extremely costly. This concern is primarily rooted in unpredictable compute costs as more and more users start accessing these dashboards. As more users come onto the platform, response times also become far less consistent. Ultimately, consumers end up losing the low latency response they were promised and organizations still end up spending more than expected.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, organizations also try to solve their dashboard needs with a data federation approach. Federation vendors often tout the ability to have a single point of data access to all data sources. Unfortunately, this typically gets customers in more trouble due to 1) the high costs of procuring this technology and hosting it on very large servers, 2) a single point of failure, and 3) a newly introduced bottleneck which slows down dashboards even more.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Introducing Modern Data Platforms, and their challenges</span></p>
<p><span>The pains faced by dashboard users and the engineers behind them can very often be linked back to the monolithic legacy systems that they are architected upon, or often the overindulgence in new, single-purpose data platform technology. Accelerating those dashboards, and tuning your systems to be ready for</span> <span>fastboards requires a scalable, general purpose database built for fast data ingestion and limitless amounts of users. SingleStore Managed Service is built for fastboards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>SingleStore Managed Service</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.memsql.com/"><span>SingleStore</span></a><span>’s database-as-a-service offering is called <em>SingleStore Managed Service.</em></span>&nbsp;<span>Our platform is a distributed, highly-scalable, cloud-native SQL database built for fastboards. SingleStore is designed for highly performant ingest of any operational data, whether it is batch or streaming in nature.

<p><span>SingleStore Managed Service: The Data Platform for Fastboards</span></p>
<h2><b>What kinds of dashboards?</b></h2>
<p><span>As discussed, SingleStore is a fantastic choice for your most important visualization and analytics needs. The following section goes a bit deeper into exactly what types of dashboards SingleStore is powering today, and some of the important concepts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SingleStore is the core data platform for many analytical applications:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Real-Time Analytics&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Operational BI</span></li>
<li><span>Historical Reporting</span></li>
<li><span>ML-Driven Analytics</span></li>
<li><span>Ad-Hoc Data Discovery, and many more</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Real-time dashboards are used to make critical business decisions in the moment. They often require sub-minute or sub-second latency, and are highly relevant in preventative maintenance, inventory and IoT applications. These types of workloads benefit greatly from SingleStore’s streaming ingestion, built-in predictive capabilities, and scalable analytics. SingleStore’s ability to quickly ingest high volumes of data, rapidly run predictive models for scoring, and store for fast retrieval makes it best in class for real-time dashboards. </span><a href="https://www.memsql.com/blog/case-study-medaxion-analytics-medtech/"><span>Medaxion</span></a><span> leverages SingleStore to achieve hospital event to insight within 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Historical Reporting dashboards encompass both the most recent data as well as long-term insights. They are often found supporting financial reporting and historical sales analytics use cases. SingleStore offers a number of different features that accelerate historical dashboards — drop-in SQL compatibility, scalable analytics functions, and built-in machine learning to name a few. SingleStore makes it extremely simple for dashboard developers to deliver high-quality, fast historical analytics for end consumers. </span><a href="https://www.memsql.com/blog/kellogg-case-study/"><span>Kellogg</span></a><span> uses the SingleStore platform to accelerate the speed of their Tableau dashboards by 80X.</span></p>
<p><span>Over time, we have seen machine learning and AI emerge to the forefront of analytics ecosystems and thus, visualizing ML through visualization has become a common way to share the performance of models. These dashboards are meant to provide a beautiful visual interface for otherwise complex data science workflows. They are often used to help executives and business people align with an organization’s predictive capabilities. At SingleStore, we see many of our customers leveraging our ML-enabled pipelines to score and visualize data in real-time. Users also leverage built-in predictive functions and our SingleStore capabilities to perform training and testing at large scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Tools</b></h2>
<p><span>Having discussed many different variations of fastboard use cases, it is also important to address the vast landscape of tools and technologies that enable these. Furthermore, there is no feature more important for a database than seamless, performant connectivity to every dashboarding tool. SingleStore is wire protocol compatible with MySQL making it instantly accessible from any BI tool such as Tableau, PowerBI or Looker and with widely-available bindings to popular programming languages such as …</span></p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The first hearing in the court case of German-Swiss media empire Ringier Axel Springer against Polish journalist Witold Gadowski was set to take place in the regional court of Warsaw Provincial court of Warsaw but was postponed due to security concerns after up to 100 of Gadowski's supporters showed up in court. </p><div><p>Axel Springer SE is the largest digital publishing house in Europe, controlling two of Germany's largest news brands, Bild and Die Welt. In Poland, it's the publisher of country's largest tabloid "Fakt" and one of the largest weeklies "Newsweek" as well as the largest newsportal Onet.pl.</p>

<p>The media group sued Gadowski for his statement in which he claimed that the company, founded in 1946, was from the outset linked to people from the Wehrmacht, the SS and Gestapo, while the company’s founder, Axel Springer, was himself involved with the Nazi regime”. In response, the media group Gadowski for infringement of personal interests.</p>

<p>Axel Springer, born in 1912 worked as an editor in his father's newspaper "Altonaer Nachrichter". After Hitler came to power in 1933, the paper participated in the anti-Jewish progaganda campaign directed against the German Jewish community. He was also a member of the Nazi paramilitary organization "The National Socialist Motor Corps". Another stain on his legacy was his decision to abandon his half-Jewish wife Martha Else Meyer, who just had given birth to their first child, soon after the Nurnberg laws came into force and remarrying with an "Aryan" woman.</p>

<p>Witold Gadowski told the media present for the hearing that he hopes that justice will prevail and that the proceeding will be on the grounds of the Polish law, where the constitution guarantees the Polish journalists’ freedom of speech. He also underlined that Axel Ringer Springer is trying to infringe on that exact freedom of speech by taking him to court.</p>

<p>The judge was surprised by the number of people who appeared in the court to support Gadowski and postponed the hearing due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>According to Gadowski, the case filed against him by Axel Springer could first step on the road to restoring the faith in the media in Poland. The columnist said that he still has faith and believes that facts and the truth will be enough to win the case.</p>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

The preset SDK meets the needs of many professional apps that use today’s managed workflow.</p><p id="ead5">However, apps whose needs aren’t met by the preset SDK want to have a custom set of modules or custom native code. Some developers might include existing modules like <code>expo-in-app-purchases</code> while others might write their own code for APIs that don’t yet have an Expo module. These projects with custom native modules or custom native code will each need their own custom development client instead of Expo Go/Expo Client.</p><p id="07e9">In this world with custom development clients, Expo Go/Expo Client isn’t the only or primary development client. To head off confusion between the Expo Client and other Expo development clients, we looked for a new name and chose “Expo Go”. Expo Go helps developers get going quickly, in many cases going all the way to production. The standard Expo workflow of the future might have both Expo Go and custom development clients:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3232/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png" width="1616" height="1283" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Yr3Idt7H52AQl25iqf2A5Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Expo development clients span Expo Go, custom development clients, and web browsers, which are development clients for Expo web projects!</figcaption></figure><p id="fd39">Custom development clients are a long-term project in the concept design phase and involve a large amount of work and complexity across the Expo platform and Expo Application Services.

So we’re renaming the Expo Client to Expo Go with the next app update coming soon to you.</p><p id="b895"><em>For developers extra excited about building custom development clients and production apps in the cloud, check out </em><a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.expo.io/expo-application-services-eas-build-and-submit-fc1d1476aa2e"><em>our announcement of Expo Application Services (EAS)</em></a><em>, the Expo team’s upcoming complementary suite of cloud services for both Expo and React Native developers.</em></p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

December 22, 2020 | https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Several times in my career, I’ve joined a team whose work was already well
under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have
pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure
I felt to establish myself and contribute. Over time, I realized that the
natural instinct to push for early impact leads many incoming leaders into
challenging relationships as they expose their knowledge deficit and waste
time. So, I developed an algorithm that has helped me ramp up quickly — and
in several cases — have an impact in a relatively short period of time, while
minimizing collateral damage.</p>
<p>The first step is to find someone on the team and ask for 30 minutes with them.
In that meeting you have a simple agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you
should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don’t
understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don’t understand.</li>
<li>For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right
now.</li>
<li>In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every
name they give you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat the above process for every name you’re given. Don’t stop until there
are no new names.</p>
<p>The sum of the answers from the first 25 mins will not give you a complete
picture of the team’s work. That will take months to develop. But they will
give you a framework for integrating new information more quickly, which will
speed up how fast you ramp. It will also heavily over index on the areas of
work under active discussion, which will help you dive in productively to the
most critical discussions immediately. The nature of what people choose to
discuss is a very valuable signal about the problems the team face, as it may
be about the work, the organization, or process. Finally, it will give you a
sense of the language and terminology that can very often be a barrier to
working smoothly with teams.</p>
<p>The answers from the second question give you a cheat sheet on how to impress
the team with early positive impact. Some of the things you’ll hear will take
time to fix, such as “we need a bigger team” or “our infrastructure isn’t
scaling.” Those are important and it will be good for the team to hear you
internalize those challenges. But a surprising number of the issues you’ll
hear repeatedly will be things you can easily help with, like “we waste a
bunch of time in meetings every week” or “we need a dedicated conference
room.” I start with the latter as quickly as I can because those are the
types of things teams often neglect to prioritize, in spite of a compounding
negative impact on progress.</p>
<p>The third question will give you a valuable map of influence in the
organization. The more often names show up and the context in which they show
up tends to provide a very different map of
the organization than the one in the <a href="http://boz.com/articles/damn-the-org-chart.html">org chart</a>.</p>
<p>For all the value I just described, the greatest value in this process isn’t
in the answers — it is in the asking. Taking these meetings and listening
shows proper respect for the team that’s in place. It can be hard to remember,
but while you may be insecure about taking a new role because you feel like
you’re at a disadvantage, the people you’re speaking with may also be unsure
about you taking that role and what it means for them. Demonstrating mutual
respect builds the trust required to make progress.</p></section></div></div>]]>

                        <li>Private variables and methods

                        Some of the above do not introduce any new capabilities into Tcl. Rather they make some programming idioms more convenient and formalize some implementation dependent behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Describing all the above would make for a rather lengthy post so this post only covers the first three. The remaining will be the topic of a future post.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Private variables and methods
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A limitation of TclOO in 8.6 was that methods were either exported (aka public), which made them callable from all contexts, or not exported which made them callable only from within the object's context. The latter includes <em>all</em> methods defined for that object including those in subclasses, mixins, filters etc. This broke isolation between class definitions.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                An author of a subclass had to be careful when defining a method (even unexported) not to give it the same name as a method in the superclass.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                At the same time, if the superclass implementation changed, necessitating the addition of a new method for private use, there is the risk that it will be hidden by a method of the same name in a subclass. Since the two classes may be written by different authors or teams, and the superclass may not be even aware of the existence of the subclass that uses it, this is a real risk.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Here is an example, contrived as always. We have a <code>Service</code> class which acts as a base for various kinds of services (daemons for the Unix weenies), database, network and so on. It has <code>stop</code> and <code>abort</code> methods which end the service both of which call <code>Terminate</code> to exit.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>oo::class create Service {
    method Terminate {code} { puts "Exiting with code $code" }
    method stop {} { my Terminate 0 }
    method abort {} { my Terminate 1 }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The service is obedient and stops when told.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% Service create service
::service
% service stop
Exiting with code 0</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Now along comes a programmer who appreciates the extensive functionality of our class and extends it to write a network server.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>oo::class create NetworkService {
    superclass Service
    method accept {client} { blah blah }
    method disconnect {client} {
        # Do some cleanup
        my Terminate $client; # close connection
    }
    method Terminate {client} {
        puts "Closing client connection"
    }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, now the service does not stop when commanded to do so. It tries to close some imaginary client connection instead.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% NetworkService create netservice
::netservice
% netservice stop
Closing client connection</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The problem of course is that the utility method <code>Terminate</code> has been unknowingly overridden. There is no isolation provided for the parent class from any of its child classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Tcl 8.7, you can define <em>private</em> methods to fix this. Calls to a method marked private will never be overridden in the context of the class that defines that method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let us try it out in our example. Instead of rewriting the class, we'll just do some targeted surgery to redefine the method as private.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>% oo::define Service {deletemethod Terminate}
% oo::define Service {private method Terminate {code} {puts "Exiting with code $code"}}
% netservice stop
Exiting with code 0</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        As an aside, notice TclOO's dynamic nature — the existing <code>netservice</code> <strong>object</strong> also picked up the corrected behaviour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some additional points:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Variables suffer from similar problems for similar reasons. A class may inadvertently name a variable that is already in use for a different purpose in a superclass or mixin. This is also resolved by defining variables as <code>private variable</code> analogously to private methods.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Methods that are forwards can also be defined with the <code>private</code> designation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Private methods are not just for classes but can also be defined for objects though they are less useful there as objects themselves cannot be derived from.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Just like <code>oo:define</code>, <code>private</code> can either be used to define a single method as above or take a single argument which is a script within which multiple methods, forwards and variables are defined. This is convenient for clubbing together the entire private section of a class.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The <code>info class</code> and <code>info object</code> introspection commands take a new <code>-scope</code> option.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <pre><code>% info class methods Service -scope private
Terminate
% info class methods Service -scope public
abort stop
% info class methods Service -scope unexported
% </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The <code>unexported</code> value corresponds roughly (but not exactly!) to protected in C++ terminology. They are not visible from outside the object's context but because they are not private, they are callable from methods defined in subclasses. We did not have any in our example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        See <a href="https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/500.md">TIP 500</a> for more examples of private methods and variables.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Inline export modifiers
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In Tcl 8.6 methods were exported by default based on whether they started with a lowercase letter or not. You could change the visibility of a method using the <code>export</code> and <code>unexport</code> commands. For example,
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>oo::class create Users {
    variable users
    method +user {name address} { set users($name) $address}
    method -user {name} { unset -nocomplain users($name) }
    export +user -user
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Because they do not begin with a lower case letter, the methods to add and remove users have to be explicitly exported. Separating the visibility from the method definition is somewhat of an irritation so Tcl 8.7 allows you to modify it with the <code>-export</code> option in the method definition itself.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>oo::class create Users {
    variable users
    method +user -export {name address} { set users($name) $address}
    method -user -export {name} { unset -nocomplain users($name) }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, there is an <code>-unexport</code> option that will hide a method that would be exported by the default rules.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        New slot operations
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        First, some background. One of the special features of Tcl's OO system is that unlike other languages it is completely dynamic in keeping with Tcl's philosophy. Class structures, relationships, object types, interfaces can all be manipulated <strong>even at runtime</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Continuing our tradition of silly examples, suppose our web server defines a request class as follows. All methods are guarded by a <a href="https://www.magicsplat.com/articles/oo.html#sect_oo_filters">filter</a> that denies access based on client location.

                    <hr> 
                    <p>The web is thirty years old this month, counting from the date the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm">first web server was launched on Christmas 1990</a>. Personally, August 6th, 1991, is more significant, when the web was publicly announced.</p>

<p>In 1991 I was writing for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> magazine, which was a lot of fun, because I got to work with, and write about, people who were doing fascinating things with computer technology. Working for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> led to writing the book <em>Taking the Next Step</em> and a short stint at Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> as a technical writer.</p>

<p>The most innovative project I encountered that year was not NeXT. Rather, it was something developed by Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. He used a NeXT computer to develop a networked information system for high-energy physicists. If I hadn’t been reading  the <em>comp.sys.next</em> Usenet newsgroups carefully, I would have missed the announcement of a “a hypertext editor for the NeXT.”</p>

<p>Not many people used “WWWNeXTStepEditor version 0.12.” The NeXT community was small and many NeXT computer users did not yet have Internet access, which was required to access Tim Berners-Lee’s experimental “WorldWideWeb” documents. To me, the name WorldWideWeb seemed a bit of a conceit since the only users at the time were high-energy physicists at a few research institutes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as soon I’d installed and tried the software, I wanted to get involved. I told everyone about it, including a fellow editor at <em>NeXTWORLD,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>. Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and cofounder of the (then-new) Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a>…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-barlow.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you don’t recognize Barlow’s references, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> was a visionary hypertext project that predated the Internet. The Matrix is not the movie universe created by the Wachowskis but, rather the network of computer networks that existed before the commercialization of the Internet (as described by the researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quarterman">John Quarterman</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently I joined the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html">www-talk mailing list</a> and also contacted Tim Berners-Lee directly. I wanted to know if he was interesting in technology I’d heard about from friends at Adobe Systems. Adobe’s editable PostScript specification (which came to be named PDF and became the basis for a product named “Acrobat”) seemed to me a better match for distributed hypertext than the very-limited SGML-based “HTML tags” that Tim Berners-Lee was using. HTML offered only minimal layout and styling possibilities; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> was a better page description language.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-timbl.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was reluctant to publicize that code for the web was available for free, as management at CERN had not yet agreed to release it publicly (that didn’t happen until <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">April 1993</a>), and I wasn’t able to write about it for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> (too bad, as I could have been the first journalist to write about the web!).</p>

<p>Subsequently, editable PostScript was released, and in 1993, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> of CERN visited me in California. I arranged a meeting between Cailliau and management at Adobe Systems. He met with John Kunze of Adobe at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and demonstrated the World Wide Web — the first time management at Adobe had seen the Web. By that time, HTML was firmly entrenched as the native language of the new Web. Adobe later invested in Netscape Communications and produced an Acrobat plug-in for the Netscape Web browser, establishing the basis for viewing richly formatted PDF pages in web browsers.</p>

<p>For some years afterward, I regretted that the Adobe/WWW meeting had not taken place the previous year, because the sparse and limited HTML format might have been eclipsed by the richer format of PDF as the primary syntax of web pages. With the adoption of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/">Cascading Style Sheets specification</a> (from 1999 forward), my views changed, and I’ve come to appreciate that the technical underpinnings of the web are optimal, reflecting both the genius of Berners-Lee’s original vision and the rich contributions of the worldwide developer community.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, it is easy to overlook the web’s origins as a tool for sharing knowledge. Key to Tim Berners-Lee’s vision were open standards that reflected his belief in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower">Rule of Least Power</a>, a principle that choosing the simplest and least powerful language for a given purpose allows you to do more with the data stored in that language (thus HTML is easier for humans or machines to interpret and analyze than PostScript). Along with open standards and the Rule of Least Power, Tim Berners-Lee wanted to make it easy for anyone to publish information in the form of web pages. His first web browser, named Nexus, was both a browser and editor. The NeXTSTEP SDK made editing easy to implement; editing was abandoned in subsequent non-NeXT web browsers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve lost sight of that original vision. Facebook or Wix make it easy to author web pages but at the cost of lock-in to proprietary systems. And when developers choose complex software such as React or Rails to build simple websites, I cringe at the violation of Rule of Least Power. I still have a “deep case of net religion” (as John Perry Barlow said in 1991) and I’m now writing about ways to build websites without frameworks and build tools (see my articles, <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/build-websites-the-yax-way/index.html">Build Websites the Yax Way</a>). My current project, <a href="https://yax.com/">Yax.com</a>, is a do-it-yourself website builder that uses new web standards (including web components) to help people build simple sites. Thirty years on, we still have a lot of work to do to realize the web’s original goals. I hope I’m not the only one who sees this.</p>

<p>I never anticipated that Berners-Lee’s NeXT hypertext project would become a medium to supplant print and television. In 1991, during idle moments, I imagined the world’s books and magazines might be reborn as hypertext (many others had imagined this earlier, including Ted Nelson, with his Xanadu project). But I never honestly believed that Berners-Lee’s software project could change the world. By 1999, as Web addresses appeared on billboards and the sides of buses, I started to accept that Berners-Lee naming his project “the WorldWide Web” was not vainglorious but simply prescient. Still, I hope his original vision of the web as a means for sharing the world’s knowledge is not eclipsed by its utility as a platform for commerce.</p>

    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
<li>If you can use the gathering to bootstrap a group chat or community, so much the better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>

<h2><span>1. Overview</span></h2>

<h4>1.1 Document Purpose &amp; Scope</h4>

<p>The business uses, regulatory interest and research in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have seen an exponential increase over the last few years. Discussions regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have gained momentum as financial services firms evaluate the potential applications of AI, including for example: to enhance the customer experience and garner operational efficiencies. AIRS is committed to furthering this dialogue and has drafted the following overview addressing the use of AI within financial services, discussing AI implementation and the corresponding potential risks firms may wish to consider in formulating their AI strategy. Our hope is to contribute to and establish an industry-wide view of the potential risks and mitigants in this rapidly evolving domain of AI/ML, as they may apply to individual firms depending on their use of AI systems.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>In this document, AIRS members present their views, guidance, and a structure for conceiving AI/ML risks and governance, drawing upon our combined experience implementing and managing technology risks in the financial sector. The views expressed in this paper are meant to assist individuals and organizations facing risks and governance challenges presented by AI/ML. However, it is critical that each institution assess its own AI uses, risk profile and risk tolerance and design governance frameworks that fit their unique circumstances. As such, this paper is not meant to be comprehensive or prescriptive.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>1.2 AIRS</h4>

<p>AIRS is an informal group of practitioners and academics from varied backgrounds, including technology risk, information security, legal, privacy, architects, model risk management, and others working for financial, technology organizations, and academic institutions. The AIRS working group, based in New York, was initiated in early 2019 and has grown to nearly 40 members from dozens of institutions (and continues to grow).</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>The AIRS Working Group seeks to promote, educate, and advance AI/ML governance for the financial services industry by focusing on risk identification, categorization, and mitigation.</p>

<h4>1.3 Definitions &amp; Assumptions</h4>

<p>We use several terms throughout this document specific to AI/ML, some of which are subject to vigorous discussions and debates in the research community. Because this document attempts to form a starting point for broader AI/ML governance and risk management efforts, we purposely leverage and encourage readers to refer to various papers for the definition of AI. As such, we note that specific definitions should be (and generally are) tailored to each organization depending on the scope, risk appetite, internal structure, culture, and implementation details of AI/ML efforts.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>While there is no universally accepted definition of AI, it is generally understood to refer to “a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, or the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.” Generally, machine learning is referred to as, “a field of computer science that uses algorithms to process large amounts of data and learn from it.”<span><a href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/#_ftn2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;The term AI is broadly used and typically includes aspects of machine learning and natural language processing. For purposes of this paper, the focus is largely on the use of and potential risks related to machine learning, though the overarching discussion applies more broadly to the abovementioned areas.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>1.4 A Brief Note on AI/ML Uses and Benefits</h4>

<p>The use of AI in financial institutions is increasing as technological barriers have fallen and its benefits and potential risks have become clearer. The Financial Stability Board recently highlighted four areas where AI could impact banking specifically.<span><a href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/artificial-intelligence-risk-governance/#_ftn3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;First, customer-facing uses could expand access to credit and other financial services. For example, combining expanded consumer data sets with new ML algorithms to assess credit quality or price insurance policies, and using AI to offer new and innovative channels to deliver financial services could be a potent way to advance financial inclusion. Also, the use of AI chatbots could provide help and even financial advice to consumers, saving them time they might otherwise waste while waiting to speak with a live operator. Second, there is the potential for strengthening back-office operations, such as advanced models for capital optimization, model risk management, stress testing, and market impact analysis. Third, AI approaches could be applied to trading and investment strategies, from identifying new signals on price movements to using past trading behavior to anticipate a client’s next order. Finally, there are likely to be AI advancements in compliance and risk mitigation by banks. AI solutions are already being used by some firms in areas like fraud detection, capital optimization, and portfolio management.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Several papers and articles describe the potential uses and benefits of AI adoption and innovation in financial services. Widespread AI/ML adoption within the financial services industry could provide a unique opportunity to significantly improve financial outcomes for consumers and businesses, if this is done responsibly. That is why AIRS has chosen to focus this paper on understanding and managing the potential risks of AI/ML so that those benefits may be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h2>2<span>. AI Risks and Risk Categorization</span></h2>

<p>Key potential risks of AI relate to potential harms that may affect organizations, consumers, or create broader detrimental effects on society. Such potential risks may arise in whole or in part from sources including the data used to train the AI system; potential risks arising from the AI system itself; potential risks arising from the usage of the AI system; and potential risks arising from poor overall governance of the AI system.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<h4>2.1 Risk Categorization</h4>

<p>Various research papers, articles, and discussions have covered the topics of risks associated with AI. It is up to individual financial services firms to categorize potential risks of using AI: however, we have included a suggested approach to AI risk categorization in the financial services industry below.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>The areas of data related risks, AI/ML attacks, testing and trust, as well as people risk constitute potential areas of risk, which could be subcategorized as illustrated in&nbsp;Figure 1.&nbsp;We address these sub-categories in further detail below.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p><span>It’s important to note that the applicability and relevance of risks illustrated in Figure 1 are dependent on an individual organization’s risk profile, appetite, and existing controls, and it is up to each firm to determine whether …</span></p></div></div>

This security innovation uses two dimensional (2-D)-material tags and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled authentication software.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“Anti-counterfeiting tech by NUS researchers does reliable AI authentication under extreme conditions” by&nbsp;National University of Singapore, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fz5zwmqfeQ_Y&amp;t=M2M1Mjk4YTk0MjE5ZDMzYmU4NjQ4MDEzMmI3M2UxYTBmYTY4ODhjNCxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002172">YouTube</a>.</i></p><p>Compared to conventional anti-counterfeiting technologies, <i>DeepKey</i> works faster, achieves highly accurate results, and uses durable identification tags that are not easily damaged by environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, chemical spills, UV exposure, and moisture. This new authentication technology can be applied to different high-value products, ranging from drugs, jewellery, and electronics. For example, <i>DeepKey</i> is suitable for tagging COVID-19 vaccines to enable rapid and reliable authentication, as some of such vaccines need to be stored at the ultra-cold temperature of -70°C.</p><p>Led by Asst Prof Chen Po-Yen and Asst Prof Wang Xiaonan from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NUS Faculty of Engineering, the team’s 2D-material secure tags exhibit Physically Unclonable Function patterns (PUF patterns), which are randomly generated by systematically crumpling the 2D-material thin films. The complex 2D-material patterns with multi-scale features can then be classified and validated by a well-trained deep learning model, enabling reliable (100 per cent accurate) authentication in less than 3.5 minutes.</p><p>Current anti-counterfeiting technologies using PUF patterns normally face several bottlenecks, including complicated manufacturing, specialised and tedious readout process, long authentication time, insufficient environmental stability, as well as being costly to make.</p><p>“With this research, we have tackled several bottlenecks that other techniques encounter,” said Asst Prof Wang. “Our 2D-material PUF tags are environmentally stable, easy to read, simple and inexpensive to make. In particular, the adoption of deep learning accelerated the overall authentication significantly, pushing our invention one step further to practical application.”</p><p>The researchers published their results in scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS2590238520305592&amp;t=ODAwODgzNmQ1OThmMDNmZTJkZjVmOGQyMjJkYjJjZWRkMTIwZDllZCxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002172"><i>Matter</i></a> on 2 December 2020. This study was conducted in collaboration with researchers from Anhui University of Technology and Nanyang Technological University.</p><h2><b>A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags</b></h2><p>Remarkably, the researchers do not need any special equipment to create the secure tags. They can simply be made with a balloon, a bottle of 2D-material dispersion, and a brush.</p><p>“First, we inflate the balloon and brush over its surface with viscous 2D-material ink. After air-drying overnight, we deflate the balloon. Because of the interfacial mechanical mismatch between the 2D-material and latex substrate, large-area, crumpled PUF patterns are generated during the contraction. These PUF patterns can be cut to the required size afterwards, and normally, hundreds of them can be made at one time,” said Dr Jing Lin, a member of the research team.</p><p>Next, the researchers take a quick image of the PUF tag with an electron microscope, which is then synced to their innovative software to go through the deep learning “classification and validation” process. “The whole process takes less than 3.5 minutes, most of which is spent waiting for the readout from the electron microscope. The authentication itself is very fast, in less than 20 seconds,” explained Dr Jing.</p><figure data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/32922ca933e0580cc4e864cde80d8ebc/c63a4c8653de1bfd-38/s1280x1920/10ec3b7e954e357ad6da471ea33a0a91997626cc.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2880" data-orig-height="1620" width="1280" height="720"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;A stable, simple, and scalable process to create PUF tags.

However, the high encoding capacity also leads to long authentication time, as the “search and compare” pattern validation has to be conducted within a huge database. This trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time often restricts such PUF-based anti-counterfeiting tags from practical applications.</p><p>“With our new technology, we are breaking this long-lasting trade-off between high encoding capacity and long authentication time by using classifiable 2D-material PUF tags and deep learning algorithms,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>First, the researchers used various 2D materials to fabricate PUF tags with AI recognisable features. Second, they trained a deep learning model to conduct a two-step authentication mechanism. “We used the deep learning model to pre-categorise the PUF patterns into subgroups, and so the search-and-compare algorithm is conducted in a much smaller database, which shortens the overall authentication time,” Asst Prof Wang explained.</p><p>Currently, the only available technologies similar to this NUS innovation, are polymer wrinkle-based tags. Wrinkled polymer tags are authenticated based on the surface patterns just like the novel 2D-material tags. However, their authentication presently requires one-by-one feature extraction and matching, which is slow and shows only 80 per cent reliability. The NUS team’s authentication is boosted by deep learning, and is therefore much faster, and reaches nearly 100 per cent validation precision.</p><p>In addition, compared to the wet chemistry preparation of polymer wrinkle-based tags, which involves the use of harmful organic chemicals and UV light, the NUS researchers’ fabrication technique is significantly faster and safer.</p><h2><b>Next steps</b></h2><p>The NUS team has filed a patent for their invention and is now planning to push this technology one step further. “We are searching for better, faster, and more robust readout and authentication approaches for our PUF tags,” said Asst Prof Wang.</p><p>The team has already begun to conduct research on other readout techniques to further shorten the processing time. “In addition, such naturally encoded information by the PUF tags could be further secured by being kept on blockchain, so that the whole supply chain and quality control can be transparently tracked,” Asst Prof Wang added.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.nus.edu.sg%2Freliable-anti-counterfeit-checks-under-extreme-conditions%2F&amp;t=NmYyZGMxYWE1OTY1MzllOGEwYzY4M2EyY2U1NjlmY2Y4ZmE2YjI0NSxsd3lMalFPcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638251976736604160%2Fdeepkey&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1609002172">National University of Singapore</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“

<p>When I first read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40109367-dare-to-lead">Dare To Lead</a> by Brené Brown a few months ago, I hated it. I ranted to my book club about how it’s not actionable. It’s true but not useful, I said, because it’s all <em>why</em> and no <em>how</em>. </p>



<p>Now that I have a few months of life experience under my belt since I read it, I understand the value. Turns out, it’s one of the most impactful books I’ve read in years, because Brené is great at <em>giving things names.</em> </p>



<p>Some examples:</p>



<ul><li>“<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">Courage over comfort</a>” meaning we should choose the hard thing that leads to growth over the easy comfortable thing.</li><li>“<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/05/respond-to-vulnerability-with-vulnerability/">Rumbling</a>” as a term for honest, vulnerable discussions that feel uncomfortable but build trust.</li><li>“<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">Clear is kind, unclear is&nbsp;unkind</a>” meaning that if you’re not being clear about your thoughts and feelings then you’re being unkind, even if you think you’re doing that to be kind.</li><li>“<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">Living into our values</a>” as a reminder to pick your 2 (and only 2) values and use them to make value-based decisions.</li></ul>



<p>The thing is that I <em>knew</em> about all of those things already. I knew that being honest is good. I knew that the hard thing is often the right thing. Blah blah blah. </p>



<p>But giving those guidelines a name made them real and specific and memorable. A name gives us a mantra to repeat in our heads when we come across a tough choice.</p>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=BKStV9pypM&amp;rank=1">The Culture Code</a> talks about naming things and repeating those names over and over and over until they become a part of the culture:</p>



<blockquote><p>A while back Inc. magazine asked executives at six hundred companies to estimate the percentage of their workforce who could name the company’s top three priorities. The executives predicted that 64 percent would be able to name them. When Inc. then asked employees to name the priorities, <em>only 2 percent could do so</em>. </p><p>This is not the exception but the rule. Leaders are inherently biased to presume that everyone in the group sees things as they do, when in fact they don’t. This is why it’s necessary to drastically over-communicate priorities. The leaders I visited with were not shy about this. Statements of priorities were painted on walls, stamped on emails, incanted in speeches, dropped into conversation, and repeated over and over until they became part of the oxygen.</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code</cite></blockquote>



<p>Later, it talks about what a good catchphrase looks like:</p>



<blockquote><p>The trick to building effective catchphrases is to keep them simple, action-oriented, and forthright: “<em>Create fun and a little weirdness</em>” (Zappos), “<em>Talk less, do more</em>” (IDEO), “<em>Work hard, be nice</em>” (KIPP), “<em>Pound the rock</em>” (San Antonio Spurs), “<em>Leave the jersey in a better place</em>” (New Zealand All-Blacks), “<em>Create raves for guests</em>” (Danny Meyer’s restaurants). They’re hardly poetry, but they share an action-based clarity. They aren’t gentle suggestions so much as clear reminders, crisp nudges in the direction the group wants to go.</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code</cite></blockquote>



<p>None of those have a surprising message. Obviously companies want their employees to work hard and be nice, for example. But naming them and repeating them gives them power.</p>



<p>Since understanding this, I’ve been working on defining what my own catchphrases or rules are. <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/episodes/2-The-mantras-we-live-by-eo3mlo">My friend and I just talked about this on our podcast</a>, in fact! Later in the week I’ll post the polished list I’ve decided on.</p>
