<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <div>
                <div><p>I’m a coach to CEOs and leaders to support them on their journey back to aliveness. Last week a client of mine asked what she could do to be a better CEO or leader. And whether I had any tips for her or things she could do. She heard that the best leaders and CEOs get up early and are really focused on self-care and on the business.</p>
<p>I paused, looked at her mischievously and said that I think that’s entirely the wrong question. And that on top of that, I think that there is no such thing as a great CEO or leader. The only thing that does exist in my experience is a powerful and alive human that loves what they are doing and that happens to run a business. And <strong><em>then</em></strong> other people look at them and say “this person is a great CEO!”. Unfortunately, often we get it all twisted and turned upside down when we try to start at that label and reverse engineer from there.</p>
<p>Whenever we start at the conceptual description of a role, it’s a dead end. Whether you try to be a great CEO, a great mother, father, girlfriend, employee, marketing manager or what have you. <em><strong>Even if we succeed, it always leads to disappointment and resentment</strong></em>. That is because when we try to fit into a pre-conceived role, we make ourselves fit into something that is just a mental concept, like that of a CEO. It has little to do with who we are as powerful humans.</p>
<p>Instead, I exclusively coach around bringing every conversation back to the human level. Meaning to ask in different shapes and forms: What makes you come alive? How do you feel powerful and playful? <strong>This is where greatness <em>in hindsight</em> comes from.</strong></p>
<p>So instead of asking yourself “What makes a great leader?” or “What makes a great CEO?”, I want to give you 3 better questions for greatness in hindsight and aliveness today:</p>
<h2>What’s stopping you from doing what’s right in front of you?</h2>
<p>We can get lost in hypotheticals of “what makes a great leader!” easily, but often, that’s just an excuse for focusing on what’s right in front of you. If you take a second to pause at this moment, <strong>I’m sure there’s something right there, right in front of you that you’d love to do. But! That you’re also scared of</strong>. And maybe it’s a completely simple and obvious thing – in fact, it often is. Here’s a list of things I’ve heard about from CEOs just in the last couple of weeks of coaching sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an honest conversation with a director in the company</li>
<li>Buy a piece of equipment for the factory</li>
<li>Take a week of vacation</li>
<li>Start writing a book</li>
<li>Let yourself feel dejected</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not big things. But each of these things, if repeated daily and with attention, is what will turn into greatness over time and have other people say “this person is a great leader!”. But even more importantly, it is what makes us feel alive and excited and we get to work with the simple, scary, obvious thing right in front of us. <strong>And I’m much more interested in aliveness than in greatness.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>What are you feeling most unsure and&nbsp;insecure about?</h2>
<p>I had a client who was the CEO of a popular tech platform. He was an engineer by trade, yet almost every session he told me that the biggest opportunity he saw for his business was to focus more on marketing and sales. And yet, most of the actions he took were focused on building yet better tech and AI features for the business.</p>
<p>When I pointed that out, he vulnerably confessed that he feels so safe and savvy when it came to engineering, yet so stupid and inexperienced when it came to marketing and sales. To me, that was a massive success, since when we find where our insecurity lies, and we allow ourselves to explore it, that’s when we truly uncover our potential for growth and the next steps. The area where we feel masterful already is often one where we’ve explored much of our potential also.</p>
<p>The places in your life that you are drawn to, but feel timid, insecure, and unsure about are often the ones where the most growth waits for us.</p>
<p>Which parts of your life do you feel most insecure about, that you put off often, but also know that it’s something you deeply value? Then begin with giving those parts a tiny bit more oxygen and attention and see what next steps naturally unfold.</p>
<h2>Who do you care most about?</h2>
<p>A bit over 10 years ago, I was a startup founder standing on top of a hill in San Francisco, 20 years old, fresh off the plane from Europe, wide-eyed and excited for my upcoming adventure. Over the following 6 or so years, I went down the rabbit hole of startup life. I faced the deep struggle of startup fundraising that almost put me out on the street homeless. I had to leave the US because of Visa troubles, traveled around the world, had to fire a co-founder, and through all the ups and downs eventually managed to build a business that’s doing north of $20m in revenue today.</p>
<p>When people ask me, what is the one thing I regret not having on my startup journey, I say this: I wish I had a coach. A trusted, grounded, emotionally intuitive person who knows what he’s talking about and has experienced what I have. I often felt deeply alone, miserable, burnt out, elated, excited and so much more. Yet, I wished I’d had a safe place to bring all this to.</p>
<p>On my journey since building that business, eventually moving to live in a Buddhist monastery for close to two years, training as a trauma therapist to learn the skills of deep emotional presencing, I made that my calling. To be that person to the startup founders, leaders, CEOs and creators of the world. To support them and be their coach as they go through life. Nothing has been more fulfilling for me than this. And when I’m in a rut where I wonder “How can I be a great coach?”, I know that that’s not the right question. And instead, a better one I like is to think about how can I support the people I care most about more or better. <strong>This is where I see action, potential, fun and excitement.</strong></p>
<p>I’m guessing that the same is true for you. With the business you’re in or the life you have, <strong>what are the kinds of people you care about the most and that you want to support?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This question can bring us into the here and now very quickly: People that are cold in the wintertime? Children dying of cancer? Leaders that want more confidence? Men that want to have more empathy? When you take out a piece of paper and write that question at the top, you might be surprised by what kinds of answers you come up with. <strong>And you might also be surprised at how quickly you have an idea of what to do next, now that you wrote that down.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>What is your next, one, tiny step?</h2>
<p>I get sucked into attaching myself to big ideas without ever making progress, just like the next person. I’ve been renting the apartment I’m living in for over a year. Although I always thought of this as the most amazing place to ever live in, I barely furnished it in that time. One thing I’ve been dreaming about was to have lots and lots of plants. And yet nothing happened. Then a friend of mine gifted me a plant the size of a drinking cup, I’ve posted a picture of it below.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-300x225.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-768x576.jpg 768w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
<p>And from there, suddenly and magically, I felt empowered and encouraged to take more tiny steps, like that one tiny plant to furnish my apartment. Although I have a long way to go, it already feels much more homey and comfortable than before.</p>
<p>It can feel ridiculous to think about taking tiny steps when you’re already a big-shot CEO or when you’re wanting to become one, one day. And yet, I know no better tool at times than to take a step so ridiculously small in the direction that you want to go and to see what happens next. Usually, all the other steps flow from there.</p>
<p><strong>With the big dream you have in front of you, what’s one tiny step, that’s almost ridiculous, that you can take today?</strong></p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>These questions and stories above are designed to help you do one thing only: <strong>to move from the hypothetical, abstract and unhelpfully analytical into the concrete, the here and now</strong>. This is where your power lies in my experience. And it is when true change and transformation can begin.</p>
<p>At the root of it all to me is the question: <strong>How can I come alive as a human and live into my truth?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you really do want to play it big, focus on that last question more than anything, and naturally, all greatness you ever longed for, as a CEO or otherwise leader and human will naturally follow. There are no great CEOs, only people that have come alive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-2ae295f5=""><p><em>Herein I share an experienced developer's first foray into a real-world Rust project. It focuses closely on the type system, and the key insights I needed to begin "thinking in Rust". Written for those getting to grips with the language, it will be especially useful if your background isn't functional programming.</em> </p>
<p><em>Although originally conceived as part 2 of 2, this can be read as a standalone entry.

<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-1.jpg" title="Picture of the completed Tide Clock"></p>
<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> z<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
	
		
		<span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
			x<span>,</span>
			y<span>,</span>
			z<span>,</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>trait</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><em>"Okay, so like <code>Trait</code> is just a different way to spell <code>Interface</code>? Gotcha. But no inheritance? That's pretty wild. But composition over inheritance, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now that we've implemented the <code>Drawable</code> Trait, we can call its methods on our struct: </p>
<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage wrote 26 programs between 1836 and 1841 for the unfinished "Analytical Engine" (AE). The code is embedded implicitly in tables summarizing program traces. In this talk, I present the programming architecture of Babbage’s mechanical computer based on the first code written for the machine. The AE had a processor separate from memory, and worked using a kind of dataflow approach. The stream of arithmetical operations was independent from the stream of memory addresses. Special "combinatorial" cards allowed the processor to execute FOR and WHILE loops. Combinatorial cards also allowed independent looping through the stream of memory addresses. Quite sophisticated computations were possible and illustrate why Babbage talked about the possibility of doing "algebra" with his machine. The programs I will discuss predate by several years the account published by Menabrea in 1842 and translated later by Lady Lovelace with notes of her own.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In 1991, the famous game "Another World" was published for the Commodore Amiga. It achieved cult status mainly for its visionary art style. But also technically it was quite interesting, as it was based on a game-specific bytecode language executed by a virtual machine interpreter. Eric Chahi, the author of "Another World", six years earlier had written the game "Infernal Runner" on the Amstrad CPC. The game, published by the French company Loriciels, was rated fairly mediocre by the press, was rather simple, and also still had some bugs. Nonetheless, the game is cool from a software architectural point of view. Like "Another World", it is largely not written as a conventional Z80 program, but in a specifically designed bytecode language. This language is interpreted by a virtual machine supporting "parallel" execution of up to 255 tasks by a simple multitasking scheduler. This nice concurrency feature enabled a very elegant design of the various enemies and animated game levels. The talk will cover the essentials of this bytecode language, the virtual machine interpreter, and the process scheduler. Some code examples from the game will be shown, as well as a port of the virtual machine to JavaScript to make the game playable in a web browser. The talk tries to also give you some insights into the reverse engineering process and how much fun this was.</p>

<p>Knowing your PO2 goes a long way towards making it safer to go deeper with an oxygen rebreather.  If you want to go pure O2, it can be used to monitor how purged the loop is, and if you want to go a little deeper it can basically turn an O2 rig into a sort of mixed gas rebreather (or a full mixed gas rebreather with proper diluent addition).</p>

<p>In order to conveniently know my PO2, I have <em>purchased</em> O2 sensors.  Having built in temperature compensation and having reliable manufacturing seems like a big plus vs fabricating, assembling, testing, QCing and calibrating my own.</p>



<p>For my first iteration I have started with just two cells.  A third would be easy to add if this works out.</p>

<p>The electronics are going to be split into three parts- the cells/stuff in the counterlung, an electronics box, and a display.  I decided that the only things in the counterlung should be the sensors themselves and a connector.</p>

<p>The “Electronics Box” will house the brains of the operation (an ESP32), and the battery.  Batteries and other flammables will be kept outside of the oxygen rich environment of the rebreather, for obvious reasons.  In the unlikely event of the battery shorting to the cells, hopefully the high impedance of the cells will limit resistive heating or fire.  In the future, a USB port with a cap will be wired in for charging.</p>

Surprisingly this does not seem to create any significant leak paths, although there is always a slight possibility that I will have to eat my words on that someday.</p>

<p>The display will be upgraded to a HUD at some point, but for now it will be wrist mounted.  It displays two PO2 cell readings, a compass heading, and (in the future) the depth.  As you can see in the photo, the top row is “highlighted” to show a problem- the cells are disconnected and are reading a <em>very</em> high PO2.</p>

<p>Reading an off the shelf galvanic O2 cell is dead easy, since the temperature compensation and shunt resistor are built in.  However, the output voltage is fairly low, and so it should not be fed directly into the ADC of a typical micro.  It is possible to read such a voltage (~20mV), but it wastes a good portion of the resolution of the ADC.</p>



<p>For example, the maximum output expected is 2V (representing a PO2 of 2).  With a 5v ADC, we are only ever using 2/3 of the range of the ADC, which effectively limits our resolution of PO2s to 2/3 the resolution of the ADC.</p>



<p>Since these signals are also not amplified or buffered in any way, it seems good to keep them away from the mcu.  I have resolved to put them on an I2C DAC with an internal gain stage, which will let me both maximize resolution and keep the signal wires for the cells short.  To this end, I used an ADS1015 breakout from adafruit.</p>



<p>Since it was on hand, I also threw in an LSM303 to use as an electronic compass.  Since the compass has no “inertia” it has kind of jumpy readings, but doing some smoothing should help to get it to be a little less jittery.  I could also try some compensation for nearby electronics, but they seem to have little effect.  The LSM accelerometer/magnetometer lives in the wrist piece, although I did consider mounting it in the “head”, which would show you body heading, but not necessarily what you are looking at.</p>



<p>The display is the 128×64 OLED featherwing.  Its easy to integrate, and it is fairly compact in terms of “extra space” for unused headers/buttons.</p>

<p>I  headed to the mystical mystic lake to do some testing.  The combination of near zero visibility to start with and a haze of sediment/algae/stuff I don’t want to think about made for a more-or-less night dive like conditions, even with a light, during the day.  However, the little O2 cell reader and compass seemed to behave relatively well.  Most importantly the firmware did not crash, and no water seemed to get in.  Cant wait to test it somewhere actually fun!</p>

<p>Tesla CEO just announced on Twitter that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package price will go up by $2,000 starting Monday next week. This price hike is going to set the FSD cost at an staggering $10,000.</p>



<p>In the past, Musk has warned that because of the increase in valuation of the FSD software with the passage of time, Tesla owners will have to pay more to enjoy this futuristic technology. </p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319164198241341440" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319164198241341440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/full-self-driving/">Tesla FSD</a> software gains more and more confidence in roaming the city streets, the $10k price tag might seem affordable in the future. And with the advent of Tesla Robotaxis where the car makes money for you in its free time, the cost will be fully justifiable.</p>



<h2>FSD Beta wide-release</h2>



<div>
<div>
<p>During last evening’s Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Elon Musk also said that the wide-release of FSD Beta will start rolling out at the end of this year. Currently, this specific software release is limited to drivers and owners who are deemed ‘safe and responsible’ by Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> also said that the wide-release of the FSD Beta this year depends on how much safe this update proves itself in the coming weeks and months of testing.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>In response to some other questions regarding the worldwide release of FSD beta this year, Elon Musk said that it’s a long process to meet all the regulatory approvals and countries like the UK have Right-Hand-Drive cars, that’s also a challenge to meet.</p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319159425995857921" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319159425995857921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>Musk also agreed to a suggestion that the price change should currently only take effect in the United States. As in Europe and other countries, the Full Self-Driving phenomenon has yet to go through many obstacles that Elon Musk himself described in the above tweet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given the hype and excitement around yesterday’s FSD Beta limited-release and the upcoming price hike in a few days, Tesla will be able to sell a sizable number of Full Self-Driving packages before Monday.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In your startup’s early days, goal planning is easy, since you have a clear vision of what you want to build. And you have personally validated that vision through close contact with your customers. But, as your start to scale and your startup grows larger, this starts to get difficult. Read this <a href="https://www.kaapi.team/blog/a-simple-idiot-proof-guide-to-goal-setting" target="_blank">great piece by Ankit on the high level</a> mental models needed to define your goals. In this article I build on my experience in multiple high growth startups to focus on the process of setting goals across a 50-100 member organisation.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>The exercise is as important as the goals</strong></h2><p>The first question you might reasonably ask is <em>why do I need to have an ‘exercise’? </em>Because until recently all you did was buy some pizzas and have a spirited debate, why not just do that with your executive team? A quote I love that explains this best:</p><blockquote><em>"Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." - Elon Musk</em></blockquote><figure id="w-node-8a4c3ef8b215-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc151d61003389cb31a79_vectors%20of%20your%20startup.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a refresher, a vector has both a magnitude and a direction and if they aren’t pointing in the same direction they cancel each other out. Dharmesh Shah, who had this conversation with Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-elon-musk-taught-me-growing-business-dharmesh-shah/" target="_blank">goes into a lot more detail</a>.</p><p>The reason you need to have an <em>‘exercise’</em> is because as your organisation grows larger you have a lot more ‘vectors’ from diverse backgrounds and with diverse experiences within your organisation. You as the CXO need to make sure they are aligned in the same direction.</p><p>A good planning exercise makes sure that you set the right goals and choose the right metrics to track them. And more importantly it also ensures that all your employees are 100% aligned on the <em>‘why’</em>. This is important to drive participation and motivation.<strong>‍</strong></p><figure id="w-node-033014d8b68e-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc137d87721cc33afad3f_Goal%20planning%20exercises.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2><strong>Step 1: Challenge&nbsp;your bias</strong>‍</h2><p>This seems rather obvious, but, what you are really doing here is challenging your biases. As a CXO you think you understand best what your customers need. And it is most likely true, what you are really looking for is information that challenges your biases that you gather through:</p><h3>Market Research</h3><p>Always be testing the market, not just once a year, it should be a perpetual process. It will greatly <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-decrease-the-odds-that-your-startup-fails-e0fc13213792" target="_blank">reduce the odds that your startup will fail</a>. It doesn’t have to be in-depth or a great presentation. It just has to answer these two questions:<em><br>I think my startup is in market ‘X’. Is that true?<br>Is market ‘X’ where I create the maximum value?</em>‍</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>You should create a culture of documentation and make that documentation accessible to everyone in the startup. There is a treasure trove of information in your meeting minutes, customer interviews and NPS surveys. And it’s not enough that you are documenting your thoughts. This needs to be decentralised. Every salesperson should be noting down insights after a call, and every engineer post a deployment. This will help you answer these questions:<em>‍</em></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<em>I have some assumptions for growth, what are outliers that validate/invalidate my assumptions?</em></li><li><em>Who in my organisation has the most information about or can challenge the assumptions I am making?</em></li></ul><h3>Take inputs from everyone (Yes, every single person)</h3><p>This comes before the OKR (or KPI, KRA), it’s time consuming so you can’t always do it, but I would recommend doing this at least once a year till you grow to &gt; 100 people. This is where you ask your teams to submit the answer to the question: “<em>What do you think the organisation should focus on in the next year/quarter?</em>”. You can do this over a simple Google Form and then open the results to the entire company. There are two things you find out here:<em>‍</em></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<em>Is there something that I’m missing?</em> - This is usually something that’s not urgent but in the long run may hurt like tech debt so I’d pay attention<em>‍</em></li><li><em>What do our employees care about?</em> - This is important so that you can address why you aren’t picking something. And it creates a backlog of ideas</li></ul><p>Btw. It really helps to have a Chief of Staff who among other things <a href="https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/software-at-your-service-ceo-interview-series-should-i-hire-a-chief-of-staff-dc5fc4274d5f" target="_blank">manages this process</a> and adds another objective layer between your biases and the organisation's priorities.&nbsp;At the end of this you should have a pretty well-formed answer to what you think your goals should be. Your hypotheses are tested against statistical and anecdotal evidence and you are pleased about the inclusive process.&nbsp;</p><p>But, you still have one step left: <em>convincing your executive team</em>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Step 2: Agreeing to a plan and get buy-ins&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Now, I don’t mean to say that your executive team is standing between you and hyper growth. They’re not. They’re the ones who day-to-day are going to be driving your strategy and they need to be convinced (<em>to almost the point of no doubt</em>) that the course we will take as a startup is the correct one. They need to buy in to this collaborative vision.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There is plenty of content to actually run a strategy meeting, you can use a legion of tools and frameworks (below are <a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank">templates from Miro</a>) and I’d recommend getting a masterclass as a facilitator from somewhere like <a href="https://ajsmart.com/masterclass" target="_blank">aj&amp;smart</a>.</p><p>Here are a few things I’ve learnt that help with the process outside of how the meeting is designed.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Talk to everyone individually before the meeting:</strong> I can’t stress this enough, never go into a strategy meeting without knowing the opinion of everyone in the room. Nothing is more damaging than an executive feeling that they aren’t a part of the decision making process. Through your conversations you hear their concerns and either give them context that helps address them or acknowledge that you’ll work to resolve them.</li><li><strong>Send reading material ahead of time:</strong> Your executives are busy, send all the research gathered and the conclusions at least a week in advance. It gives you the time to have individual conversations and gives them the time to form opinions. I’m personally a huge fan of <a href="https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/" target="_blank">Amazon’s 6-pager memo</a>.</li><li><strong>Don’t brainstorm:</strong> This is an editorial meeting, brainstorming should have happened earlier, you are here to sift through ideas. (read: <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/brainstorming" target="_blank">Managers must be Insane to brainstorm in groups</a>). Working remotely of late I’ve realised this is even more important to remember since it is easy to get lost brainstorming without actually deciding anything.</li><li><strong>90% agreement rule:</strong> There’s theory that suggests <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa" target="_blank">we spend 90% of our time on the 10% of things we disagree on</a>. So, get the 90% you agree on out of the way first. Every time you come across a disagreement let it be heard but discuss it at the end.</li><li><strong>Agree to disagree and commit</strong>: Again from Amazon, you won’t get agreement on everything but it will save a lot of time. From Jeff Bezos’s letter to shareholders: “<em>Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?</em>” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-266c3bcfa6a5-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc170e6d64d4871a323eb_miro%20templates%20for%20goal%20planning.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2><strong>Step 3: Pedal to the metal</strong></h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc11724084b352a4c9874_fast%20and%20furious.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now you can start executing!<br></p><p>You don’t have to do this entire process every time, and your plans will definitely change midway, but it’s still worth it. By doing these three simple things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Anecdotal and statistical information is collected from across the organisation</li><li>Employees feel ownership of the targets since they contributed to the plan</li><li>Your executive team agrees and commits to their responsibilities<br></li></ol><p>You should be able to increase productivity (<em>Shorter daily standups and KPI reports</em>), get everyone on the same page, and increase the overall morale of your startup. All your vectors are now aligned. Maybe the stars will soon too! Go go.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

              After 3 months of trying everything I could think of, I give up.
              I don’t think I will ever develop anything for the Google
              ecosystem again. I’m not angry, I’m not doing this out of spite.
              I just don’t think it is worth it to invest any amount of effort
              to build something on a platform that turned out to be so
              unreliable.
            </p>  <h2>Please scroll down to read the latest update.</h2>  <p>
              I started developing my first extension back in 2010, when Apple
              finally decided to implement proper extension support in Safari.
              Exciting times. I spent a weekend writing my first Safari
              Extension, an ad blocker called “Cleaner Facebook”. I must
              confess it was ugly, and by today’s standards, very poorly
              written, but it did the job.
            </p> <p>
              After a few weeks while browsing Facebook using Chrome, the
              annoying ads popped up and I figured that it’ll be worthwhile to
              port it over, so I did. I also made it available to everyone via
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank" title="App Development">Graffino’s apps playground.</a></p> <p>
              Months later the due to some policy changes in Chrome, I moved
              to the Chrome Web Store where I made it available for free under
              the name “Cleaner Facebook”.
            </p> <p>
              What happened next was beyond my wildest expectations. It
              quickly gathered around 4.000 users and over the last year it
              surged to 24.000+ users. Whenever I pushed an update, the
              numbers would spike.
            </p> <p>
              I got quite a few offers to sell it, so others could push
              advertising through it. Thing is, I never wanted to make any
              money off it and I felt like I was betraying my users. So, I
              kept it and improved it constantly. It worked so well because I
              needed it to work well, I was using it daily and my users loved
              it. It got a 5 stars rating and over 85 reviews.
            </p> <blockquote>
              Google has been notified that some of your materials allegedly
              infringe upon the trademarks of others.
            </blockquote> <p>
              At the end of May this year, I received an email from Google
              telling me that my extension violated Facebook’s trademark and
              got taken down. There was no information how to solve the issue,
              no way to appeal. Google washed its hands clean and directed all
              inquiries to an automatically generated email address. This
              email address was a black hole that never responded to any of my
              emails.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/bcfd01f.png" alt="Google's notification that they removed Graffino's Ads removal app from the store."> <figcaption>
                The original infringement and taken down notice (shortened).
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              I figured out that the name might be an issue although there
              were
              <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/facebook?hl=en-US" target="_blank">a lot of other extensions</a>
              with the same name in the store. Even so, I changed the name of
              my extension to “Cleaner — for Facebook” and resubmitted it to
              the store where it got placed “In review”.
            </p> <p>
              Over the next weeks I never received any email from the Chrome
              Store other than the initial take down notice. When I logged in
              again, I found my extension was still “Taken down” and the “In
              review” flag gone.
            </p> <p>
              I went on to search for a Developer Support page, but after half
              an hour of searching I found out that there is none. There is no
              support whatsoever for the developer besides Google’s own
              documentation. If you encounter an issue that you can’t solve
              yourself, you’re stranded. There’s no contact info. No one to
              write to.
            </p> <p>
              After getting really frustrated that day, I vented out sending
              out a nasty email to removals@google.com. Not sure it helped.
            </p> <p>
              The next day I poked around and found a support form intended
              for Chrome Web Store users. In my desperation I figured this was
              my only option left.
            </p> <p>
              About a week later, I got my first reply from <em>Google</em>.
              Although it sounded nice, it wasn’t really helpful. Most
              probably due to the fact it was a canned response, totally
              unrelated to my issue.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/a38f41d.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>First canned response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Later that day, I fired a few other emails, telling them that my
              extension was not under review and the cause for the take down
              was not flagging. I also submitted another message via the
              support form I used before. My requests got closed with a
              <em>“Thanks for your feedback.”</em> canned response.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/c1a157e.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>“Thank you for your feedback” response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Meanwhile my extension’s user base was dwindling, and I could do
              absolutely nothing about it.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/ee3fd6a.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>

                July.
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              After another two weeks I finally gave up and sent this final
              email. I got a reply that my case was “Reopened”. It’s been a
              month and I didn’t hear back since, so I don’t think I will ever
              get my extension back on the store.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/3e2eaf4.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>Final email from my side.</figcaption></figure> <p>
              I’m not playing the victim here, and I don’t expect this post to
              solve anything for my extension. I just want you to think twice
              before creating a revenue stream based on the Chrome Web Store.
            </p> <p>
              Google has great automated tools and services, to help
              developers ramp up and deliver their apps to users quickly and
              painless. Most of the time these tools work perfectly. The
              problems arise when they don’t.
            </p> <p>
              I have never experienced such frustration, and such feelings of
              helplessness from any other major player out there. A similar
              issue with the
              <a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.graffino.cleaner-for-facebook-86755BRK69" target="_blank">“Cleaner Facebook” Safari extension”</a>, got promptly solved by Apple in under three days.
            </p> <p>
              Google has a record of very bad user support. Basically, if your
              issue is not listed in the “Support Forums” you’re screwed. If I
              would have based my business on the Chrome Web store, I would be
              out of business by now.
            </p>  <h2>Update 8.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I never imagined this would generate this amount of attention:
              featured by
              <strong>Medium, 100k+</strong> views, heated discussions on
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/51mgix/how_google_obliterated_my_4_year_old_chrome/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
              or
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12442048" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>. I don’t really expect this to change anything for me, but I’m
              glad people are speaking up. If Google would implement a paid
              support option like Apple does for its developers, I’m sure a
              lot of pain would be avoided.
            </p> <p>
              I try to read everything, but I don’t respond on Medium (hate
              the commenting system), but you can ping me on Twitter.
            </p> <h2>To answer the most common questions:</h2> <p>1.<em> “Why don’t you change the name completely?”</em></p> <p>
              Well, because using “for Facebook” in the name is considered
              <a href="http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FairUse.aspx" target="_blank">fair use</a>. Also, when managing an app or extension with that many users,
              you don’t really want to confuse the users by renaming it to a
              completely different thing over night. It’s also an extension
              that only works on Facebook. I might also be infringing with the
              icon.
            </p> <p>
              So, you see, I really need guidelines to do this. Again, my
              problem is with the way this was handled, not the takedown

              2.

              This is simply untrue. I don't believe I was intentionally
              targeted. I was simply unlucky enough to be targeted by
              automated tools. Even the way my requests were handled weren’t
              done with malicious intent by Google. I think I’m just an edge
              case for which their support tools aren’t equipped to deal with.
            </p> <h2>Update: 9.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I received an email from Google today in which they’re
              expressing their apologies about the incident. It seems that
              they cannot do anything for the current store entry until the
              original complainant retracts his complain.

              They offered me clear options though. We’re currently assessing
              what the best option might be. As I said in the article, this
              wasn’t an intentional targeting but a slip-up of their support
              which they’re trying to fix.
            </p> <p>
              Hopefully I will have the time to write a follow-up once all
              this is over. I didn’t expect or wanted this kind of attention,
              these have been 2 stressful days for me, trying to keep up with
              all the requests and messages, as I do have a job and my own
              company to run.

              It also happens that today is my birthday. I guess receiving a
              response from Google was my birthday present :).

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p><p>

\[\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) \geq \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^2\]

</p><p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p><p>

\[\langle u, u \rangle \langle v, v \rangle \geq | \langle u, v \rangle | ^ 2\]

</p><p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle u, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= (a_2 + b_2 i)^{\dagger} (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} - b_2^{\top} i) (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) + \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, u \rangle &amp;= u^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= (a_1 + b_1 i)^{\dagger} (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} - b_1^{\top} i) (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} a_2 + b_1^{\top} b_2) + (a_1^{\top} b_2 - b_1^{\top} a_2) i \\ 
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) - \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>It is trivial to see that</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p><p>

\[| z | ^2 \geq | \text{Im}(z) | ^2\]

</p><p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p><p>

\[\langle Au, v \rangle = \langle u, Av \rangle\]

</p><p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Au, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} Au \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= {(Av)}^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= \langle u, Av \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \rangle_{\psi} \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) \psi \rangle \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) \psi \rangle \\
&amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2 \\
&amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the hermitian property again,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, \psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) - (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) - (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) - (\Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \Omega_1 \Omega_2)  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  - [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<h2 id="org5aed8cc">Introduction</h2>
<div id="text-org5aed8cc">
<p>
I was asked in an interview once to reconstruct a tree given the pre-order
and in-order traversals.  I bombed it.  I could talk through a general
idea.  Which I'll do with some illustrations, but I terribly bombed as I
did not get an answer.
</p>

<p>
So, lets do a brief descussion on it.  First, a tree.
</p>


<p><img src="https://taeric.github.io/a-tree.png" alt="a-tree.png">
</p>

<p>
For this illustration, I'm showing both child links of any node that has
any children, with one of them going to Λ if it is a null link.  As a quick
refresher on the standard orders you can list the nodes of a tree, this
tree would be "ABCJKEGH" in pre-order, and "JCKBAEHG" in in-order.  (And if
you did post-order, you would get "JKCBHGEA".)
</p>

<p>
The question, then, is given two of these orders, would you have enough
information to recreate the tree?
</p>

<p>
The answer is yes, if the two orders you have ar pre-order and in-order.
Also if you have in-order and post-order, but <b>not</b> if you have pre-order
and post-order; unless you know the tree is "full," in which case you can
use those two orders.  For this page, I'm only going to be looking at the
first case.
</p>

<p>
The reason it is doable from the pre-order/in-order combo is that you know
the root of the tree from the pre-order, and if you split the in-order with
that value, you know the nodes that make up the left and right.  From which
you can find the pre-order of them and do this again.
</p>

<p>
This makes an algorithm straight forward.  In lisp, taking liberties and
using lists for the orders, this is as simple as this:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defstruct</span> <span>node</span> value left right)

(<span>defun</span> <span>make-tree-from-traversals</span> (pre-order in-order)
  (<span>when</span> pre-order
    (<span>let*</span> ((root-value         (first pre-order))
           (left-in-order      (list-before in-order root-value))
           (right-in-order     (list-after in-order root-value))
           (left-pre-order     (list-filter-to-same-elmts pre-order left-in-order))
           (right-pre-order    (list-filter-to-same-elmts pre-order right-in-order)))
      (make-node <span>:value</span> root-value
                 <span>:left</span> (make-tree-from-traversals left-pre-order left-in-order)

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-after</span> (lst i)
  (<span>cond</span> ((eq i (first lst))   (rest lst))
        ((eq lst nil)         nil)
        (t                    (list-after (rest lst) i))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-before</span> (lst i)
  (<span>cond</span> ((eq i (first lst))     nil)
        ((eq lst nil)           nil)
        (t                      (cons (first lst) (list-before (rest lst) i)))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-filter-to-same-elmts</span> (lst elmts)
  (<span>loop</span> for v in lst
        if (find v elmts)
          collect v))

(make-tree-from-traversals '(a b c j k e g h) '(j c k b a e h g))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>#S(NODE
   :VALUE A
   :LEFT #S(NODE
            :VALUE B
            :LEFT #S(NODE
                     :VALUE C
                     :LEFT #S(NODE :VALUE J :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL)
                     :RIGHT #S(NODE :VALUE K :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL))
            :RIGHT NIL)
   :RIGHT #S(NODE
             :VALUE E
             :LEFT NIL
             :RIGHT #S(NODE
                       :VALUE G
                       :LEFT #S(NODE :VALUE H :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL)
                       :RIGHT NIL)))
</pre>

<p>
Note that the pretty print of the data is enough to show the structure,
where you can see that "e" has a nil left and "g" has a right nil, for
example.
</p>

<p>
To further that this is correct, you can also just print the pre-order and
in-order to see if they give the same values.  We can do that here:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defun</span> <span>pre-order</span> (root)
  (<span>when</span> root
    (format t <span>"~a"</span> (node-value root))
    (pre-order (node-left root))
    (pre-order (node-right root))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>in-order</span> (root)
  (<span>when</span> root
    (in-order (node-left root))
    (format t <span>"~a"</span> (node-value root))
    (in-order (node-right root))))

(format t <span>"Pre-order: "</span>)
(pre-order #S(NODE
              <span>:VALUE</span> A
              <span>:LEFT</span> #S(NODE
                       <span>:VALUE</span> B
                       <span>:LEFT</span> #S(NODE
                                <span>:VALUE</span> C

<h2 id="org8be69a4">What was amusing about that?</h2>
<div id="text-org8be69a4">
<p>
But I said I bombed this?  I also titled the post as searching for an
amusing algorithm, so?
</p>

<p>
I bombed this because I had remembered reading this exact problem in
Knuth's Art of Computer Programming Vol 1.  I told the person interviewing
me, but they weren't aware of any clever algorithm.  (That or they just
wanted me to get the straight forward way done first.  A reasonable
desire.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless, I couldn't shake what I half remembered from that book.  And,
being an interview, I also could not consult the book.  So, I kept battling
what I thought I remembered as a straight forward iterative solution that
made clever use of "thread" links.  (If you don't know what a "threaded
tree is, I highly recommend looking those up.)
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, I made the mistake of not working out the problem on
my first read through.  I sketched it in my mind and thought I saw a way to
make it happen.  But I did not follow through with that.
</p>

<p>
Flash forward several years, and I finally had a good reason to remember
and devote time to this.  In a book club at work, we are reading this
section and I recalled bombing that interview.  So, I was hoping someone in
the group would know the trick I did not.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, nope.  And consulting the book showed that I basically remembered
all of the hint.  Only reference to the algoritm is to link the nodes using
the left link to go to the next by pre-order, and the right nodes to go to
the next by in-order. From there, it is ostensibly "quite amusing to
construct a simple algorithm…"
</p>

<p>
To get an idea of what that would look like for this tree, here it is drawn
with the left links in solid, and the right links dashed.
</p>


<p><img src="https://taeric.github.io/pre-order-to-left-in-order-to-right.png" alt="pre-order-to-left-in-order-to-right.png">
</p>


<p>
As of right now, I don't know what the "amusingly simple" algorithm is.
However, I have pieced together something.  In the spirit of Polya's "use
all of the provided data", I thought I would run with a reference in the
text that said "In some algorithms it can be guaranteed that the root of
any subtree always will appear in a lower memory location than the other
nodes of the subtree."
</p>

<p>
In particular, this trick, I thought, would be all that I needed so that I
could recognize "thread" links in the tree from normal ones.  If this is
the trick, it is certainly not all of it, as I did not see any easy way to
work with the threads.
</p>

<p>
Further, to work with an algorithm that I have control of things being
lower in memory than others would be a bit of a challenge.  Luckily, no
reason to use literal memory locations.  I could just build an array and
use indexes into the array instead of references to memory.
</p>

<p>
With that, I came up with this beast:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defun</span> <span>create-from-traversals-iterative</span> (pre-order in-order)

          do (setf (elt nodes i) (make-node <span>:value</span> v

                                            <span>:right</span> (index-of-preorder-for-next-in-order v
                                                                                        pre-order

    <span>;;</span><span>The left of the last item will be set one high, quick correction here.</span>
    (setf (node-left (elt nodes (1- n))) -1)

    <span>;;</span><span>Now, convert all of the index links into standard links, per inspection</span>
    (<span>loop</span> for node across nodes

          do (<span>let</span> ((cur node)
                   (highest i)

               <span>;;</span><span>Find the "highest" node that we can find walking right.</span>

                               cur (elt nodes (node-right cur))))


               (<span>cond</span>

                 ((&gt; i seen) <span>;; </span><span>If the root is the highest we saw, there is nothing right of this</span>
                             <span>;; </span><span>node</span>
                  (setf (node-right node) nil))

                 ((&lt; i seen) <span>;; </span><span>Otherwise, move the highest we saw to be right of here, removing it</span>
                             <span>;; </span><span>from the left of where it is in the array.</span>
                  (setf (node-left (elt nodes (- seen 1)))  -1
                        (node-right node)                   (elt nodes seen))))

               (<span>cond</span>
                 ((&lt; i (node-left node)) <span>;; </span><span>If left is still an index, convert that to the relevant</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p> </div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Difficulties">Difficulties</span></h2>
<p>While discussing the declaration with parents, teachers and children, I realized that many are not even free to speak. One of the authors of the declaration, a teacher, requested anonymity. It might hurt his reputation at school. One of the moms flatly refused a permission to let her kid join the support. Even more, she kindly requested I do not discuss my ideas with her son any more. He is in trouble at school "well enough". For kids to tolerate the oppression, there must be unanimity in the adult world. If I question the limits on freedom, the kid will cling to the only ally he can find. I experienced that many times. This universal dislike of schooling was one of the reason for this initiative. It is not a healthy situation in society when <b>we are not even free to talk freely about freedom</b>!

<p>How we ensure that scraped records stay functional.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/self-healing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/self-healing.jpg 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/self-healing.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When you scrape a website, it's inevitable that the data you selected will change. The data itsself will change but also the structure behind it. Or as we call it, the DOM. </p><h3 id="but-why-does-it-change">But why does it change?</h3><p>Changes to websites are inevitable. Just like we update Scraper.AI regulary, the engineering team of that website will also update their website. Those adjustments are needed to introduce new features, fix bugs, ... .</p><p>Changes that website engineers often make can be categorized as:</p><ul><li><strong>Structural</strong>: The Structure of the document changes, containers were moved, text was added, ...</li><li><strong>Styling</strong>: The appearance of elements was changed (ex. a new color was given to the text)</li><li><strong>Interactive</strong>: The way you interact with something has changed, for example, clicking the button now opens a popup instead of shifting the page.</li></ul><p>However, those <u>structural</u> changes might bring tiny alterations that will prevent your previously working scrape from working again. Requiring you to manually update everything, all over again.</p><h3 id="this-is-where-self-healing-comes-in">This is where self-healing comes in</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png 765w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When paths don't work, self-healing will identify this and try to fix it. It might do this by finding the exact piece of text you asked for. Or it will try to look closer if your selection can't be found in a certain proximity.</p><h3 id="in-technical-terms">In technical terms</h3><p>Technically it might look like this. Let's assume that we selected some text in a container and obtain the following XPath:</p><figure><pre><code>/html/body/div[8]/div[3]/div/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul/li/div/section/div/div/div[2]</code></pre><figcaption>The previously working XPath</figcaption></figure><p>However, the site pushes an update and changes its structure, which breaks that XPath on the next scrape. Our systems will now detect this and try to self-heal it.</p><p>The "healed" path looks now like</p><figure><pre><code>/html/body/div[7]/div[3]/div/div[3]/div/div/div/ul/li[1]/div/section/div/div/div[2]/div[1]</code></pre><figcaption>The adjusted path</figcaption></figure><p>You can notice that if we try to analyze this, quite a lot has changed, let's highlight it in bold:</p><p>/html/body/div<strong>[7]</strong>/div[3]/div/div[3]/<strong>div/div</strong>/<strong>div</strong>/ul/<strong>li[1]</strong>/div/section/div/div/<strong>div[2]/div[1]</strong></p><p>These are subtle changes, but make a world of difference, or in our terms, the difference between working and not working.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Self-healing was introduced to boost reliability. It's an important feature that will prevent you from having to make updates to previously selected paths. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ðŸ¥³</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve been working at warp speed since our <code>v0.7.0</code> release in June, adding over <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.0...main">870 commits</a> since then. :sweat:</p>
<p>Here are some of the bigger changes:</p>
<h3>LemmyNet projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet">LemmyNet</a>, where all lemmy-related projects live.</li>
<li>Split out the frontend into a separete repository, <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a></li>
<li>Created a <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client">lemmy-js-client</a>, for any js / typescript developers.</li>
<li>Split out i18n <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-translations">lemmy-translations</a>, that any app or site developers can import and use. Lemmy currently supports <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/lemmy/">~30 languages!</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Lemmy Server</h3>
<h4>Federation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>federation public beta release</strong>, woohoo ðŸŽ†</li>
<li>All Lemmy functionality now works over ActivityPub (except turning remote users into mods/admins)</li>
<li>Instance allowlist and blocklist</li>
<li>Documentation for <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_federation.html">admins</a> and <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/contributing_federation_overview.html">devs</a> on how federation works</li>
<li>Upgraded to newest versions of @asonix activitypub libraries</li>
<li>Full local federation setup for manual testing</li>
<li>Automated testing for nearly every federation action</li>
<li>Many additional security checks</li>
<li>Lots and lots of refactoring</li>
<li>Asynchronous sending of outgoing activities</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Separated the UI from the server code, in <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a>.</li>
<li>The UI can now read with javascript disabled!</li>
<li>Itâ€™s now a fully isomorphic application using <a href="https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/isomorphic">inferno-isomorphic</a>. This means that page loads are now much faster, as the server does the work.</li>
<li>The UI now also supports open-graph and twitter cards! Linking to lemmy posts (from whatever platform you use) looks pretty now: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6TZ2v7s.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Improved the search page ( more features incoming ).</li>
<li>The default view is now <code>Local</code>, instead of <code>All</code>, since all would show all federated posts.</li>
<li>User settings are now shared across browsers ( a page refresh will pick up changes ).</li>
<li>A much leaner mobile view.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backend</h4>
<ul>
<li>Re-organized the rust codebase into separate workspaces for backend and frontend.</li>
<li>Removed materialized views, making the database <strong>a lot faster</strong>.</li>
<li>New post sorts <code>Active</code> (previously called hot), and <code>Hot</code>. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.</li>
<li>New sort for <code>Local</code> ( meaning from local communities).</li>
<li>Customizeable site, user, and community icons and banners.</li>
<li>Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.</li>
<li>Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.</li>
<li>Lots of API field verifications.</li>
<li>Upgraded to pictrs-v2 ( thanks to @asonix )</li>
<li>Wayyy too many bugfixes to count.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Weâ€™d also like to thank both the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> for their support in allowing us to work full-time on Lemmy ( as well as their support for <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html">other important open-source projects</a> ), <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/sponsors">those who sponsor us</a>, and those who <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/">help translate Lemmy</a>. Every little bit does help. We remain committed to never allowing advertisements, monetizing, or venture-capital in Lemmy; software should be communal, and should benefit humanity, not a small group of company owners.</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_docker.html#updating">with manual Docker installation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_ansible.html">with Ansible installation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Federation</h2>
<p>Federation is finally ready in Lemmy, pending possible bugs or other issues. So for now we suggest to enable federation only on test servers, or try it on our own test servers ( <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/">enterprise</a>, <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">ds9</a>, <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/">voyager</a> ).</p>
<p>If everything goes well, after a few weeks we will enable federation on <a href="http://dev.lemmy.ml/">dev.lemmy.ml</a>, at first with a limited number of trusted instances. We will also likely change the domain to <a href="https://lemmy.ml/">https://lemmy.ml</a> . Keep in mind that changing domains after turning on federation will break things.</p>
<p>To enable on your instance, edit your <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L60">lemmy.hjson</a> federation section to <code>enabled: true</code>, and restart.</p>
<h3>Connecting to another server</h3>
<p>The server <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">https://ds9.lemmy.ml</a> has open federation, so after either adding it to the <code>allowed_instances</code> list in your <code>config.hjson</code>, or if you have open federation, you donâ€™t need to add it explicitly.</p>
<p>To federate / connect with a server, type in <code>!community_name@server.tld</code>, in your serverâ€™s search box <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/search/q/!main%40ds9.lemmy.ml/type/All/sort/TopAll/page/1">like so</a>.</p>
<p>To connect with the <code>main</code> community on ds9, the search is <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code>.</p>
<p>You can then click the community, and you will see a local version of the community, which you can subscribe to. New posts and comments from <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code> will now show up on your front page, or <code>/c/All</code></p>

Here's a summary. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_heater_unit" target="_blank">radioisotope heater units</a> (RHUs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a> (RTGs) in space. Examples include the RHU used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4" target="_blank">Chang'e 4</a> to survive cold lunar nights, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG" target="_blank">MHW-RTG</a>s in the Voyager probes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG" target="_blank">GPHS-RTG</a>s used by Cassini and New Horizons, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">MMRTG</a>s at the heart of Curiosity, Perseverance, and the in-development Dragonfly. (Interestingly, an RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#RTG_for_interstellar_probes" target="_blank">proposed for an interstellar mission</a> (<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>), as its 432-year half-life could provide 500+ years of power [<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>].) The world’s first nuclear fission reactor, and the only launched by the US, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAP-10A" target="_blank">SNAP 10-A</a>, a <sup>235</sup>Uranium-Zirconium hydride reactor with sodium-potassium (NaK) coolant which had a thermal power output of 30 kW. It was launched in 1965, stopped working after just 43 days, and has had <em>seven</em> “anomalous events” that caused nearly 50 trackable pieces of debris to be shed from the craft. It should stay in orbit for 3,000 years… unless it breaks up further. The other ~30 known fission reactors were launched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet RORSATs</a>: nuclear-powered LEO ocean-surveillance radar satellites that required periodic boosts to prevent reentry. They were designed to launch their <sup>235</sup>U reactors to a higher orbit at the end of their operational lives. (These orbits will last 300-1,000 years, but the reactor fuel has a half-life of 70,000 years… so future generations may not love the plan.) But, these boosts didn’t always happen: in 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Cosmos 954 RORSAT</a> malfunctioned, reentered, and broke apart over northern Canada with the reactor attached, scattering radioactive debris over an 800 km long path—the USSR eventually paid $3M for cleanup, about a fifth of the true cost. Other satellites have also broken up in orbit, spreading radioactive debris, like the US’s Transit 5BN3 (carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power#SNAP-9" target="_blank">SNAP RTG</a>) and the USSR’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402" target="_blank">Cosmos 1402 RORSAT</a>. Others, including the higher power and higher orbit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1818" target="_blank">Kosmos 1818</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1867" target="_blank">Kosmos 1867</a> RORSATs, have leaked trails of radioactive NaK coolant. The usefulness of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on NASA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission" target="_blank">SolarMax</a> mission was reduced by <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/RORSAT/RORSAT.html#Kosmos-1867" target="_blank">anomalous gamma ray emissions from these leaking higher-orbit reactors</a>.

                <div>
                    <p>Bottoms-up growth is a buzzy go-to-market technique right now. From the exciting self-service adoption of products like Figma to the record breaking growth of Zoom, products that enable individuals to adopt a tool without first having to talk to sales is a winning strategy. Customers get started faster, and because they understand the product, they don’t need to be marketed or sold to in order to make a purchase decision.</p><p>But these companies are finding that self-service adoption is only the first step in a customer journey. For the business to grow, individuals and teams adoption needs to eventually lead to enterprise sales. Sure, in the best case that happens naturally as excitement inside the company forces a CIO’s decision. More often than not though, it still requires traditional sales to step in. </p><p>The tricky part is that all that self-service usage data is messy. There’s nothing stopping people from signing up with personal emails or multiple people at the same company from signing up for their own teams, completely independently from each other. All of this easy adoption leaves you with multiple different teams and overlapping users, all working for the same employer. Cutting through the noise for Sales, Marketing, and Success teams requires bringing order to the chaos. </p><p>Today, we’ll talk through how you can structure product data into account hierarchies that are actionable, all within SQL and your Data Warehouse. Here's what we'll cover:</p><ul><li>How to identify companies</li><li>Understanding your current product data model</li><li>Aggregating product data into companies</li><li>Using your new hierarchy</li></ul><h2 id="identifying-companies">Identifying companies</h2><div><p>It all starts by figuring out what real world companies are using your product. And in order to identify a unique, real world company, we need a reliable identifier. Unfortunately, that may not be immediately obvious if you’re just looking at a list of users that have signed up to start using your product. But we have one very obvious hint: domain names that appear in users email addresses. </p><p>Domain names are the easiest place to start building an account hierarchy. They’re easy for humans to understand and debug. And users are often providing them directly to you as part of their email address. Alternatively, you can also ask users to provide this domain as they’re signing up to your product. </p><p>To start building our account hierarchy of companies, we’ll create a set of all the domain names that appear in our database. There’s some obvious issues to this (A very common example gmail.com users) and we’ll address them along the way. So let’s see what domains we have.</p></div><h2 id="understanding-your-data-model">Understanding your data model</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png" alt="Understanding your data model" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We’re going to be translating one model to the other so before we dive in, let's get a handle on what your data looks like currently and where it’s located. It may be spread across a few different tables, it may not even be in your data warehouse (<a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">you do have a data warehouse, right?</a>). </p><p>One thing to keep an eye out for: does your product have a workspace concept? You might call it an organization, a group, or a team. This group is a really powerful hint we can use for identifying companies. If you do have workspaces, you’ll also need to know who is the “owner” of a workspace. This is typically the user that created it, but you may have a better identifier such as admin.</p><p>With your users and your workspaces, you can use some basic SQL to extract the domain from an email address. For each user and workspace, you now know which Company they belong to. We can use this to start aggregating our users.</p><p>Pro tip: You may have situations where companies are represented by more than one domain. In this case, you’ll want to add the ability to associate secondary domains to a primary domain as part of rolling up workspaces together.</p><h2 id="aggregating-into-companies">Aggregating into Companies</h2><p>The simplest hierarchy is </p><ul><li>GROUP BY domain</li><li>COUNT(*) of users or workspaces</li></ul><p>We’ve got the start of our account hierarchy. We can roll up more metrics from here. For each metric, it’s a matter of thinking about what sort of aggregation makes sense at the company level, ie SUM, AVG, MAX</p><p>What about personal email domain users like gmail.com or outlook.com? Well, that depends a bit on your business. You have three options, and the right option for you depends on what percentage of your user base use personal accounts</p><p><strong>1) Ignore them</strong><br>This is a completely reasonable option and the best place to start. Chances are, users that provided a personal email address are likely using your product for personal reasons. For example, someone using Notion to track their sourdough recipes are not going to be interested in Enterprise Single Sign-on features. So, you may want to just ignore them. You can do that by simply ignoring every domain in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856/">comprehensive list of public email domains</a>.</p><p><strong>2) Roll up to a single account</strong><br>You could also translate all of the personal usage into a separate Public Email catch all company/account. This is a great strategy if you plan to connect these users/leads to other parts of your marketing automation and don’t need company information. If you’re planning on publishing this data to a CRM however, it’s really only worth while if you plan on having a human review the users that end up associated with this account.</p><p><strong>3) Use firmographic data </strong><br>The most advanced option is incorporate firmographic data such as data provided by Clearbit, Zoominfo, or FullContact to translate a personal email address into an employer. Note that this data is not perfectly accurate so you may end up linking users to their previous employers or to someone completely unrelated to them. </p><h2 id="using-your-new-hierarchy">Using your new hierarchy</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png" alt="Using your new data hierarchy diagram" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now that you’ve got your Account Hierarchy up and running, you can start putting it to use. Census makes it easy to connect the data models you build in your Data Warehouse to the Sales and Marketing products you use to drive your Customer Journey, but how that journey unfolds is completely up to you.</p><p>What you’ve built is a Business Identity model that you can share across all of your products and tools. Census helps you associate this product model with all the other tools you use to serve your customer.</p><p>Here’s just a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Enrich your existing accounts and contacts with usage data</strong> - Use this data to give account reps context on what users are doing in product without searching across all your tools</li><li><strong>Identify net new logos</strong> - Use the data to identify companies that are actively using the product but are not yet in your CRM.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>October 08, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Any successful founder will tell you that team, product, and market are the most critical factors to building a successful business. And you’ll probably hear many of them talk about being “customer-obsessed” or “customer first.” But one of the most underrated factors in their success is not just the customers but also the quality of their early adopters.</p>
<p>While we can all agree that early adopters are good, they are not all created equal. The wrong users can derail entrepreneurs, causing them to lose focus and solve the wrong problems. Like a bad team or poor product, the wrong early adopters can push a company towards failure.</p>
<p>You should be picky about who you serve, especially during the initial phase of your product development process. Finding early adopters should be an investment similar to hiring a team. Entrepreneurs should recruit, interview, qualify, and partner with early adopters that will help them become most successful. It’s not a simple process and shouldn’t be taken for granted.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right early adopters? That’s a difficult question to answer. It’s all going to come down to your market, product, and judgment. But here are some characteristics that you should look for.</p>
<h2>They are in real pain.</h2>
<p>The right early users are deeply affected by the problem that you’re solving. They know the problem exists and are hungry for a better solution. They’ve probably tried other solutions and yearn for something better.</p>
<p>Early adopters will be keenly aware of the problem. They will explain the problem in various ways and how it affects their ability to work, live, or perform some activity. They’ve probably even tried to solve it somehow, maybe using Excel, some no-code app, a third-party tool, or a manual process.</p>
<h2>Their problem is very specific.</h2>
<p>Users have all kinds of problems. Most of which you’ll never solve. Others might be in your roadmap but are not core today. It’s essential to focus on users with the specific problem that you are solving for. Problems can emerge from various systems, workflows, and integrations that have nothing to do with the core problem or your potential solution. Eliminate the users who are looking to solve all of their problems. Eliminate the users who want a different, possibly related, problem solved.</p>
<p>The best early adopters need to solve a specific problem. It’s vital to ensure that it matches your vision and product solution.</p>
<h2>They are excited to help you.</h2>
<p>The solution you’re offering them is going to alleviate a pain point, and the best early adopters are more than excited to help you help them. The more excited they are, the more pain they experience from the problem.</p>
<p>Early adopters are partners. They should be excited about working with you, helping you solve their problem, and providing feedback. They should also be excited that they will be using your solution before others and developing a competitive edge as well.</p>
<p>When you acquire great early adopters, they will be the ones sending you feedback often and with excitement. They’ll be proud to help you craft your solution and feel like their part of the team.</p>
<h2>They are empowered</h2>
<p>Early adopters must be empowered to make decisions quickly. Working with your dream enterprise customer sounds great, but if they can’t get approval, move quickly, or activate your solution, you’ll be at the mercy of their bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Working with early adopters is a partnership, not a transaction. It’s important that early adopters can take your prototype, beta, or product and implement it within their team or organization.</p>
<p>The person is as vital as the company. Are they authorized to make the right decisions? Can they dedicate the time and resources to the problem and solution? Are they empowered to help you create the right solution? If they can’t meet these criteria, you should find another early adopter who can.</p>
<h2>They have a high-risk tolerance.</h2>
<p>The best products are built with customers, through an iterative process of trial and error. Early adopters who experience the pain are not enough; you need a partner who can tolerate the risks involved in the product development process. Not only do they have a high-risk tolerance, but they should also be willing and able to engage in ongoing experiments throughout the process.</p>
<p>Experimentation is critical to the process. You need to ensure that you partner with a customer that recognizes the process is about learning and improvement, not a finished product.</p>
<p>When interviewing customers, you should be upfront about this process and ensure they are comfortable with it. It’s okay if a potential customer can’t commit to the process, you can keep in touch and invite them to the product when it’s a bit more developed.</p>
<h2>Hire early adopters, don’t settle.</h2>
<p>Don’t just settle for the first few customers that show interest in your product. Spend time doing market mapping to better understand the market, sectors, and potential customers. Learn more about the companies and find who the best possible contacts would be. Reach out and conduct interviews to learn more about their organization, how the problem affects them, and their goals regarding the problem and solution. Make sure to dig in and ask tough questions to assess their risk-tolerance, current solutions, and whether they are authorized to make the necessary decisions.</p>
<p>If a potential customer seems like the problem isn’t that big of a deal, you should move on. If they can’t focus on just the one problem, move on. If they aren’t authorized to make decisions, ask about their manager and see if you can work your way up.</p>
<p>You should spend a good amount of time learning about each of these customers and selecting the best candidates. Don’t hesitate to reach out multiple times and have conversations with them to build confidence in your decisions. These will be partners as you experiment and craft your solution, so ensure you find the best possible partners.</p>
<h2>They’re all leads, too.</h2>
<p>Choosing the best early adopters doesn’t mean that the others will not be good future customers. All of these customers are now leads. Some might be great customers once you hit a particular milestone and finish more features; others might be customers down the road. Keep in touch and share updates on the product and feature set.</p>
<p>Recruiting high-quality early adopters is difficult but vital to the success of a company. Spend the time upfront to say no to customers that don’t fit your current vision and mission. While the process is difficult and costly, it’ll be worth the investment as the product matures.</p></section></article></div>]]>

            <p>Facebook’s Reality Labs have <a href="https://tech.fb.com/making-technology-feel-natural/">announced today</a> that their researchers are developing a hand tracking software that would allow touch typists to write in VR without the use of a physical keyboard.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is a predictive motion model for marker-based hand tracking that could allow typists to match their physical typing speed by only tapping their fingers on a flat surface.</p><p>In the blog post announcing the new technology, researchers; Shangchen Han, Mark Richardson, and Robert Wang write,</p><p><em>“To support touch typing without a physical keyboard — and without the benefit of haptic feedback from individual keys — the team had to make sense of erratic typing patterns. They adopted statistical decoding techniques from automatic speech recognition, and where speech recognition uses an acoustic model to predict phonemes from audio frames, they instead use a motion model to predict keystrokes from hand motion. This, along with a language model, predicts what people intended to type despite ambiguous hand motion. Using this new method, typists averaged 73 words per minute with a 2.4% uncorrected error rate using their hands, a flat surface, and nothing else, achieving similar speed and accuracy to the same typist on a physical keyboard.</em></p><p><em>This surprising result led researchers to investigate why hand tracking was more effective than other physical methods, like tapping on a tablet. The team discovered hand tracking is uniquely good at isolating individual fingers and their trajectories as they reach for keys — information that is missing from capacitive sensing on tablets and smartphones today.”</em></p><p>According to Facebook, the software is only in the research stage, they currently have no plans to place it on any product roadmap. There are already Quest titles that make use of the simpler hand tracking software available; <a href="https://www.aldin.io/waltzofthewizard/">Waltz of the Wizard</a> and <a href="https://www.laganaro.com/#/the-line-vr/">The Line</a>. Despite this promising research it looks like we will have to wait at least until the next generation of Oculus headsets to see this appear as a feature.</p>

More accurately, the “debate” was a strong adverse reaction from Troy after I shared a template I built for Prota Ventures’ portfolio companies. His feedback was, essentially, to never use a template and instead build each model from scratch.</em></p><p><em>He invited me to a 90-minute lecture he gave where he overwhelmingly convinced me and the room that, indeed, founders need to take the time necessary to build their models from scratch. After I asked him where I could find his lecture material online, he suggested we co-author this article series since there weren’t many solid resources available. We sincerely hope you find this series helpful.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Our plan is to break this out into a four-part series and guide you through the components necessary for building your own financial model from scratch:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/9/15/startup-financial-modeling-part-1-what-is-a-financial-model" target="_blank">Part 1: The Why and What of Financial Modeling</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-2-start-with-your-assumptions" target="_blank">Part 2: Assumptions</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-3-the-income-statement-and-custom-detail-tabs" target="_blank">Part 3: Income Statement and Custom Detail Tabs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/7/startup-financial-modeling-part-4-the-balance-sheet-cash-flow-and-unit-economics" target="_blank">Part 4: Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Keeping the Model Updated</a></p></li></ul><p>In short, a financial model is an abstract mathematical representation of how a company works (and more importantly, how it will work going forward). The model has inputs and outputs. The inputs are the assumptions that drive the model, things like what drives your customer acquisition cost, what your churn rates are, how much you pay people, etc. The outputs are a set of projections that show how the company will perform if the assumptions are true. One model can produce multiple sets of projections given different assumptions.</p><p>Based on a set of assumptions, a financial model is used to make smart decisions (e.g. how many sales people to hire and what to pay them). The model includes financial projections that are tied mathematically to the assumptions, which allows operators to “play with the variables” in order to understand how certain decisions might affect the future health of their company.</p><p><strong>Troy has an important story to share on this topic:</strong></p><p>“When fundraising for SurePayroll, we had some very high level financials in the pitch deck. Inevitably, VC’s would ask where the numbers came from. I would tell them that we had a very detailed financial model that drove it, I was setting the bait…</p><p>They would ask to be sent a copy of the model and I would refuse. I would only share it by first sitting down with them and an associate and reviewing the model in person and after that 90 minute session, I would leave them a copy of the model to play with further.</p><blockquote><p>They would insist that they could figure it out without the meeting, but I ALWAYS held my ground. I wanted the meeting not just to save them time and frustration learning a new model, but more importantly to get more face time with them in a situation where I was going to shine.</p></blockquote><p>I knew the model inside and out since I built it; I could answer any question about any cell and look like a genius. In the end, I did eight&nbsp;of these meetings and EVERY ONE of the firms that did the 90 minute meeting with me on the financial model either made an investment in the company or made an offer to invest in the company.&nbsp;<strong>Every single one</strong>.”</p><p>While it’s easy to search around and find a template to use, those templates were built by someone with a particular business in mind. Since every business is unique, this will lead you into trouble.</p><p>While it’s often helpful to&nbsp;<em>learn&nbsp;</em>from other people’s models to ensure, for example, that you aren’t missing anything important, you should never build your model using their template. You’ll end up banging your head against a wall when you need to change things, and you’ll inevitably be confused about some nuance that will come back to haunt you since you don’t understand it.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, while you may think that a template will help you save time, what you are actually doing is acquiring “technical debt” that will end up costing you more time in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>Plus, it’s critical to understand every column, row, cell and tab in your spreadsheet for two key reasons; it will help you better manage your business, and when the time comes to explain it to an investor, you’ll be able to explain exactly how it works and increase your odds of landing funding.</p><p>Since most people are using the financial model to communicate projections to investors, it is critical that you speak the investors’ language. They are used to having financials in Excel, so you should build your model in Excel.</p><blockquote><p>Google sheets is convenient for making changes and having multiple people editing, but sending an investor a model in Google sheets signals that you are not financially savvy.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are also used to seeing three standard statements; an income statement, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flow. &nbsp;Each of these is more credible if it has BOTH the past performance and the future projections in the same spreadsheet.</p><p>Your spreadsheet should contain a tab for each of these outputs along with an “assumptions” tab and custom detail tabs needed to help calculate the main outputs. We’ll walk through a specific example later in this series so you have a better understanding of what this should look like.</p><p>Because of various accounting nuances – such as fixed asset depreciation and deferring revenue – if you assign ten accountants to finish your books at the end of the year, you’ll get ten different answers for how much profit (or loss) you had in the year. While hopefully not far off from the others, each will have a slightly different report of your “profit” based on their accounting opinions.</p><blockquote><p>However, the balance of your bank account is a specific number to point at; it’s a fact that your ten accountants should agree on.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it’s important to remember that your financial model will have your own opinions baked in regarding your profit. This means that examining your cash flow carefully as you fine-tune your business assumptions is critical.</p><p>Having a solid financial model is a significant step in communicating to investors that you are a logical thinker with a defensible plan and clearly understand your business and the levers that drive it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody expects your model to be perfect, as a matter of fact, when we present a model, we always open with the same line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The only thing we know for sure about this model is that it is wrong. But, if we look critically at it we can better understand the drivers of the business and what we need to be focused on to reduce our risk.” &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind, investors are looking for the big home runs, but they are also looking at reducing their risk. The model can help them get comfortable with the risk.</p><p>– – –</p><p><em>In our next post in this series, we’ll dive in a step-by-step guide of how to build a financial model, starting with the assumptions tab.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://satchel.works/@wclittle/subscribe" target="_blank">Subscribe</a><em>&nbsp;to Will’s newsletter to get notified when the next articles are up.

The “magnonic half-adder” described in “<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41928-020-00485-6&amp;t=OGE4MWUyMjIxNzUxMjJhZjQ2ZDBlYTY3ZTYyN2U2OTY1NGNiMzI3MCxRckVLQTR5Nw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632631998427627520%2Fcomputer-circuits-magnons&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603543011"><i>Nature Electronics</i></a>”, requires just three nanowires, and far less energy than the latest computer chips.</p><p>A team of physicists are marking a milestone in the quest for smaller and more energy-efficient computing: they developed an integrated circuit using magnetic material and magnons to transmit binary data, the 1s and 0s that form the foundation of today’s computers and smartphones.</p><p>The new circuit is extremely tiny, with a streamlined, 2D design that requires about 10 times less energy than the most advanced computer chips available today, which use CMOS technology. While the current magnon configuration is not as fast as CMOS, the successful demonstration can now be explored further for other applications, such as quantum or neuromorphic computing.</p><h2><b>Successful collaboration</b></h2><p>The prototype is the culmination of four years of effort funded through Andrii Chumak’s European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, and close collaboration with Jun.-Prof. Dr. Philipp Pirro at TUK, and Dr. Qi Wang, who is currently a postdoc at University of Vienna. Univ.-Prof. Chumak started the work at TUK and now leads a research group at University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are very happy since we managed to do what was planned several years ago and it works even better than we expected”, Chumak says. When he first proposed the magnon circuit, his design was very complex. He credits Wang, the lead author of the paper, with making the design “at least 100 times better.” “We see now that magnonics circuits can be as good as CMOS, but this is probably not yet enough if you want to trigger industry. I would assume you have to be still at least 100 times smaller and faster”, says Chumak. “But this circuit opens up fantastic opportunities beyond binary data, for example to quantum magnonic computing at very low temperatures.” Pirro adds: “We are also interested in adapting the circuit for neuromorphic magnonic computers inspired by the functionality of our brain.”</p><h2><b>How it works</b></h2><p>The nanocircuit components measures less than one micrometer, far thinner than a human hair and hardly visible even under a microscope. It comprises of three nanowires made of a magnetic material called yttrium iron garnet. The wires are positioned precisely in relationship to each other to create two “directional couplers” which guide magnons through the wires. Magnons are quanta of spin waves – think of them like ripples on the surface of pond after throwing in a rock, but in this case, the waves are formed by distortions in the magnetic order of a solid material on the quantum level. It took a lot of time and effort to figure out the best nanowire length and spacing to generate the desired outcomes. Wang worked on the project for his Ph.D. at TUK. “This is the 3rd or 4th design”, he says. “I ran a few hundred simulations for different types of half-adders.”</p><p>At the first coupler, where two wires are very close together, the spin wave is split in half. One half proceeds to the second coupler, where it jumps back and forth between the wires. Depending on the amplitude, the wave will exit either the top or bottom wire, which corresponds to binary “1” or “0”, respectively. Since the circuit contains two directional couplers that add together two streams of information, it forms a “half-adder”, one of the most universal components of computer chips. Millions of these circuits can be combined to conduct increasingly complex calculations and functions.</p><p>“What typically requires hundreds of components and 14 transistors in regular computers, here only requires three nanowires, a spin wave, and nonlinear physics”, Pirro says.</p><h2><b>Future applications</b></h2><p>Pirro, who is currently leading the direction of spintronic computing at TUK in the frames of the collaborative research center “Spin+X”, will now explore using the magnon circuit for neuromorphic computing, which approaches data processing not as binary, but more like the human brain. Spin waves are much better suited for the more complex systems and have the potential to carry a great deal more information because they have two parameters – amplitude, which is wave height, and phase, which is the wave angle. In the current demonstration, the team did not use phase as a variable in order to keep it simple for binary data processing. </p><p>“If this device can already compete with CMOS, even if it is not using the full power of the wave-based approach, then we can be quite confident a scheme using the full power of the spin wave can be more efficient than CMOS for certain tasks”, Pirro says. “And the ultimate goal, of course, is to combine the strengths of both CMOS and magnonics technologies together.”

	<p>If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren’t alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa.</p>
<p>"We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era," asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2824-5">the study’s scientific article, now published in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning — an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover, &nbsp;a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted.</p>
<h2>The role of trees in the global carbon budget</h2>
<p>New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget:</p>
<p>"Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle," explains Martin Brandt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients," explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.</p>

<figcaption>The red rectangle marks the area where the trees were mapped.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Technology with a high potential</h2>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.</p>
<p>The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve.</p>
<p>"This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. It is a motivation for us to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence," says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas.</p>

    <div>
        <ul>
<li>The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.</li>
<li>Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Modules are the new way of doing dependency management in Golang.</p>

<p>A module is a collection of packages that are distributed together (e.g. a single binary). A module contains a <code>go.mod</code> file at its root.</p>

<p>With modules, it is not necessary to have our code in <code>$GOPATH/src</code> anymore, so we can create a project anywhere.</p>

<p>Let’s start a new project:</p>



<p>And make it a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ~/project
go mod init mymodule/hello
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<!--more-->

<p>This creates a <code>go.mod</code> file. Mine looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>module mymodule/hello

go 1.15
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create a main file in our module:</p>



<p>And add this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can run our application:</p>



<p>Since the point of modules is managing dependencies, let’s add a dependency to our application:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>import</span> <span>"rsc.io/quote"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>quote</span><span>.</span><span>Hello</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next time we try to run it, all the dependencies will be downloaded and the dependencies’ versions will be added to <code>go.mod</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>module mymodule/hello

go 1.15

require rsc.io/quote v1.5.2 // indirect
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is also a file named <code>go.sum</code> created. This file contains information about all the dependencies (including dependencies of dependencies):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c h1:qgOY6WgZOaTkIIMiVjBQcw93ERBE4m30iBm00nkL0i8=
golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c/go.mod h1:NqM8EUOU14njkJ3fqMW+pc6Ldnwhi/IjpwHt7yyuwOQ=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2 h1:w5fcysjrx7yqtD/aO+QwRjYZOKnaM9Uh2b40tElTs3Y=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2/go.mod h1:LzX7hefJvL54yjefDEDHNONDjII0t9xZLPXsUe+TKr0=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0 h1:7uVkIFmeBqHfdjD+gZwtXXI+RODJ2Wc4O7MPEh/QiW4=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0/go.mod h1:T1hPZKmBbMNahiBKFy5HrXp6adAjACjK9JXDnKaTXpA=
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both files should be checked into version control to provide reproducible builds.</p>

<p>We can also see all the dependencies in our module using <code>go list</code>:</p>



<p>To see the available versions of a specific module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>go list -m -versions rsc.io/sampler
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can upgrade a package to a specific version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>go get rsc.io/sampler@v1.3.1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To upgrade to the latest version, just omit the version</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article we learned how to create a simple module and manage its dependencies. The system seems simple to use, and not having to put all our code in $GOPATH/src is a nice new feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <td colspan="3">
      
      <div id="content">
      <p>Some time ago, I wrote a short article called <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/">"Writing
HTML in HTML"</a>,
where I explained why I use plain HTML to write, edit and maintain my
web site. As I've been living with my decision to eschew both dynamic
content management systems and static site generators for more than a
year, I've had the chance to reflect upon it, and I think it is time
for me to
update and clarify my original vision.</p>
      <p>In this post, I
want to explore two fundamental principles or criteria that underpinned
my original article, but were more or less unpronounced: <b>sustainability</b> and <b>power</b>. I also want to update you on my current site configuration.</p>
      <p>Before I begin, I should say that these criteria are <em>my</em> criteria, they're what <em>I</em>
value, and don't necessarily line up with what other people value. I think there are others who might value the same
things as I do; others will hopefully find the perspective interesting,
even if they don't ultimately agree.<br>
      </p>
<h3>First criterion: sustainability</h3>
      <p>The criterion of sustainability corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How difficult will it be for me to maintain – over time –<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In my life, this is a rather harsh rule. I know that
every extra step I need to perform in order to do something is going to
make me avoid doing it more. For this reason, I will consider even minor things – like needing to
install a single extra piece of software on my computer, even if it
takes only a second to install – to be lowering the sustainability of the web site. Relevant here is not only the effort required for me to edit the site, but also how likely the site is to merely <em>survive</em> over long periods of time, through server migrations and infrastructure changes.<br>
</p><h4>WordPress<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As such, I am not talking about "ease of use". WordPress is likely the
least difficult way to run a blog, but it is not the most <em>sustainable</em> way, because the effort required to maintain a WordPress site <em>over long periods of time</em> is
higher than a folder of static HTML files. To migrate a WordPress
site to a new server, you need to export the WordPress database from
MySQL on the old server, setup MySQL on the new server and import the
old database. This may not be a huge effort, but it is not as simple,
neither physically nor mentally, as a copying a folder; thus it lowers
the sustainability of the site.<br>
</p>
      <h4>Jekyll<br>
      </h4>
      <p>On the other hand, a <em>generated</em> folder of static HTML files
is not sustainable just because it can easily be copied to a new server
without having to worry about "invisible" databases. While it is easy
to migrate the site to a new server, it is <em>not</em> effortless to
update the contents of the site, because you can't re-generate a Jekyll-driven site
if you don't have Jekyll installed on the computer. Furthermore, it
is not uncommon for there to be differences in behavior between
different versions of the same generator, making it difficult to
maintain the site over long periods of time; if new versions of your
static site generator introduce breaking changes, your site is not
sustainable, because you will have to update its code whenever you
update the generator.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Sustainability
is also the one of the many reasons why my web site is served
over HTTP and not HTTPS. The problem with HTTPS is that you need to get
a certificate from a trusted authority, which either costs
money or is free but needs to be updated every month, and even if you
pay for it, you need to renew the certificate every year or so. If the
operation of your blog
depends on a monthly certificate renewal from Let's Encrypt – even if
the renewal is set up to be automatic – it is less sustainable
than
serving your site over HTTP. HTTP will <em>always</em> be around, will always be supported and will never require a certificate.</p>
      <p>Another problem with HTTPS is that it is very difficult to
revert back to HTTP once you have started using HTTPS. Every outside link to
your web site will be incorrect, and you can't redirect HTTPS traffic
to HTTP without a valid certificate. In other words, once you start
using HTTPS, you will be forever dependent on the certificate renewal
process.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>T</b><b>he more a web site resembles a folder of ungenerated, static HTML files, served over HTTP, the more sustainable it is.</b></span>
As long as the web exists, there will be web servers capable of serving
static HTML files without requiring any extra setup; static HTML is
foolproof. With that said, there are other things you can generally count
on being available without extra setup. One such thing is PHP. A folder
of <em>mostly</em> static HTML pages, enhanced by PHP includes, is nearly as sustainable as a folder of completely static HTML pages.</p>
      
      <h3>Second criterion: power</h3>
      <p>The second criterion, power, corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How limited am I in my creation and maintenance of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the structure of the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?</p></blockquote>
      <p>This
is also a rather important rule in my life, at least as far as
technology is concerned. I like doing things the way I like doing them,
especially when it comes to a creative endeavor – which building a web
site is. I don't like to be hindered by the software I use, unless the
software is good enough to outweigh the irratation provoked by its
limitations.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Streamlining<br>
      </h4>
      <p>To be fair, to make the creation and maintenance of a site easier and more
powerful in some regards, it seems necessary to introduce limitations
in other regards. For example, if I want an identical navigation menu
on every page, it is wise to use a PHP include or some type of
templating engine; but this, in turn, limits my power to customize the
navigation menu of each page specifically according to that page's
needs. In streamlining the site's navigation menu, some freedom is lost.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This
type of streamlining is not a bad idea. The problem with
most content management systems and static site generators is that they
streamline too much. If I implement a common navigation menu by putting
a PHP include on every page that needs it, then I can choose <em>not</em>
to include it on any given page. But if I implement the navigation menu
by enforcing a single common template for all pages – which is what
most CMSs and SSGs do – then I can not nearly as easily choose <em>not</em>
to include the navigation menu on some of the pages. If I need to do
so, it is possible, but I am forced to work around the system.</p><h4>Structure<br>
      </h4>
      
      <p>Likewise, static site generators like Jekyll usually make it <em>very</em>
hard to freely choose a directory structure for your site. They are
almost always built for very simple purposes: all blog posts go in <i>_posts</i>, and more complex directory structures are usually very difficult to implement, if not impossible. CMSs
are generally more flexible, but they too can be difficult to bend to
your specific needs. Ultimately, in terms of flexibility, a folder of
static, ungenerated HTML beats everything else, especially when
combined with an <i>.htaccess</i> file.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Markup language<br>
      </h4>
      <p>CMSs
and SSGs share the tendency to avoid plain HTML: most
CMSs use a WYSIWYG editor, while SSGs usually use Markdown. This is an
obvious and severe limitation: many things in this very article – such
as the red text or the right-aligned headings – are impossible to write
in Markdown (without reverting to actual HTML inside the Markdown
document). But as I mentioned in my original post, there are actually
HTML editors that don't suck, even WYSIWYG editors. I am using <a href="http://kompozer.sourceforge.net/">KompoZer</a>, one such editor, to write this very post.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>If you use a CMS or SSG, you constantly have to battle its limitations.</b></span>
You should consider whether its benefits are great enough to justify
this struggle. They might be – but I suspect that, for many
technologically talented people, they are not.<br>
</p>
      <h3>My current solution</h3>
      <p>Perhaps my own web
site (the one you're visiting right now) can serve as inspiration as to
how to build a web site according to these criteria. It is currently
implemented in the following way:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The site is a folder of <em>mostly</em> static HTML files, enhanced by zero, one or two PHP includes, depending on the page:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation menu</li>
          <li>Comments section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The
comments system, written in PHP, works by
appending new comments to an HTML file located in the same directory as
the page
being commented on. This HTML file is included via PHP on the page.
This system is not nearly as efficient as a database-driven one, but it
is drastically more sustainable<small><big>. (You can try out the system
below.)</big><br>
        </small></p>
        <li>
          <p>I have an <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/articles.xml">RSS feed</a>
implemented as a PHP script, which pulls the posts to include in the
feed from the site's front page and subsequently extracts the contents
of each post from their respective file. The front page is updated
manually.<br>
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All files upon which the various pages on the site depend – the stylesheet,
the navigation menu script and the comments script – are put in a
folder at the site's root named <i>1</i>. If I ever choose to re-write the site, I can keep this <i>1</i>
folder, so that the old pages still work, and put the new files, like
the stylesheets and scripts for the new pages, into another folder
named <i>2</i> – and so on forever.</p>
        </li>
        <p><small>In
my initial article, I put forward the idea of
putting all files upon which a page depends in that page's directory.
Pages would then be self-contained. I ultimately decided against this,
because a) it is useful&nbsp;for some pages to share some common files,
such as a stylesheet, and b) if the stylesheet always resides at the
same URL, browsers will save it in the cache. </small></p>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, I have introduced some dynamism to the site,
most notably the comments system. (It has bothered me that very few
blogs support comments nowadays. How am I supposed to respond to a blog post?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The giant robot looks like a WED Treadwell, <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/robots-i-love">my favorite robot</a> of all the Star Wars droids. I admit, I was worried that it would look organic, like a Sentinel from The Matrix, with wriggling Dr. Octopus arms and pinchy pincers that pinch. But I'm calmed by the robot's EVE-like exterior.</p>
<p>The room is sterile. A dozen masked, gloved attendants in blue buzz. I imagine I'm an astronaut about to step into the rocketship capsule.</p>
<p>Except I won't be going anywhere on this particular journey, unless something goes very, very wrong. In fact, I've already been asked repeatedly by various staffers to describe what I'm expecting to happen in this room over the next few hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm here to remove my sigmoid colon via robotic surgery because of the cancerous tumor inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm 34 years old. It's October 12th, 2020. Five weeks ago I was diagnosed with colon cancer.</p>
<h2>Stool, bloody stool</h2>
<p>I've always been a standing wiper. Not sure entirely why. I must have once, accidentally, touched a load of poo during a seated wipe. That sort of thing can change a person.</p>
<p>This charming anecdote does factor into our story, because it means I've always had a pretty good sense for my poo. Consistency, quality, and color, both in the bowl and on the TP. Did you know, there's even a seven-stage scientific classification system for your poo, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale">Bristol stool scale</a>?!</p>

<p>I first noticed blood two or three years ago. On a monthly or so cadence, I'd wipe and notice a reddish tinge. Not bright red, more like muddy-red. Poopy-red. Initially, I thought little of it. Just a minor curiousity. It certainly didn't happen every time. Still, I decided to check off the <code>Blood in stool</code> box on the forms at my annual physical with my primary care doctor that year.</p>
<p>A brief aside on the phrase "your primary care doctor." Like in <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>, the last doctor I really thought of as "my doctor" was my pediatrician. Since "becoming an adult", I've lived in three cities in two countries, which means that I've generally had no idea who my primary care doctor is or was, only that I'd need to find one to give me a referral to get this wart on my foot removed.</p>

<p>Anyway, this season's Dr. Who told me not to worry about the blood. "It's probably hemorrhoids."</p>
<p><em>WTF is a hemorrhoid?</em> I wondered to myself as I said to him, "Sounds good." Googled it after, and I learned that it's a vein that pokes out a little in your butt and doesn't really want to be poking out a little, so it bleeds. Seems like a thing that can happen, so I more or less returned to regularly scheduled programming and just dealt with the occasional poopy-red wipe. This doc also said I probably don't need to come for a physical for a few years, that annual physicals are a myth, dry land in a water world.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020. Everything sucks. And the bloody wipes are making a resurgence. Because, of course, they are. About four months ago I noticed that my first poop of the day (I usually go 2x) would have this purple-red streak embedded in it, like a racing stripe from hell. And it would happen almost without fail every single morning. That just didn't seem right, no matter what Doctors of Physicals Past told me. And then one morning I felt like I had actual blood dripping from my butt.</p>
<p>Now I consider myself to be a mostly healthy person. I eat fairly well (even though I enjoy the occasional sourdough loaf and hazy IPA), I run and bike and hike regularly, I ran an IRONMAN in 2016 and a few ultramarathons since. I also don't like being sick (who does?). But, like with most things in my life, I want to be "good" at health. An ideal dental appointment for me would go something like this, "Wow, Charlie, these are the straightest, whitest teeth we've ever seen. We'd like you to come in and be the model for our Instagram ads and also be our 3D teeth model for dentures. Congratulations. Here's <em>two</em> free toothbrushes. You also never need to floss again."</p>
<p>Anything that deviates from that ideal makes me squirm and I do think I can fix anything. For what it's worth I still believe that, if I ever encounter a blue flower on a mountain-top, I'm only a few months of mystical training away from becoming Batman. I already have the cape (it's actually a Harry Potter robe, but, hey, I'm scrappy).</p>
<p>At the same time, I counterweight this with a mild touch of hypochondria. I'll see the poison oak in the mistletoe, so to speak. In this case it was a gift.  I googled again for <em>stool, bloody stool</em> and the dreaded <em>colon cancer</em> came back. Last time, I averted my eyes from these search results. But the bloody racing stripes weren't going away. I needed to get myself checked out.</p>
<p>Then I remembered an email from work: I was eligible for a <a href="http://members.onemedical.com/membership_referrals?code=cha0014&amp;source=sa">OneMedical</a> membership. I knew there was hype about OneMedical, certainly I've seen the billboards, but I still wasn't exactly sure what they were all about. It had been a few years since my last physical, as you know, so I was primary-care-less, with a bloody problem on my hands. I downloaded the OneMedical app, uploaded a photo of my insurance card, beep-boop, and I've got an appointment with a new doc in a few days in one of their nearby clinics. Already, I loved the experience - I could text my questions any time (see <em>foot wart</em> above). I'd describe OneMedical as a network of clinics with an app for scheduling appointments and texting with a doc. Sure, ZocDoc kinda does the scheduling thing, but Zocdoc feels like you're sifting through the classifieds. Gimme some non-user-generated-ratings-based curation, please. </p>
<p>So, I met with the doc, liked him a lot, discussed my bloody poops, and sheepishly asked if he'd be my new primary care. He agreed, and he also referred me to UCSF for a colonoscopy. Sure, I'm young, and it's probably hemorrhoids, we agreed, but it's the only way to be sure.</p>
<p>After some jiggling about with the referral documentation, we finally get the colonoscopy scheduled for a few weeks later on Sept 9th.</p>
<p>Then, on August 28th, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman">Chadwick Boseman</a> died of complications from colon cancer.</p>
<p>I wasn't freaked out. Okay, yes, I was very freaked out.</p>
<h2>Colonoscopies are not bad</h2>
<p>What's a colonoscopy? It's a surgical procedure where the doctor goes all the way up your butt to see what's going on in there. You are completely knocked out, so you feel nothing. The only thing you need to do is what we in the business like to call "bowel prep."</p>
<p>Allow me to describe bowel prep: the day before the procedure, you will poop your ever-living guts out for a few hours until you are clean-as-a-whistle, stem to stern. They'll give you a prescription for a gigantic jug of clear laxatives that you'll drink every 15 minutes or so for a few hours. In today's toilet-paper hoarding economy, I'd make sure that you are stocked up, because this gets messy.</p>
<p>Other then the laxatives, you're allowed to drink clear liquids - which is confusing because you can enjoy such clear liquids as black coffee, Gatorade, broth, even green jello.</p>
<p>But that's it. Easy. I watched Stranger Things season 3 again during my bowel prep day. Might not have been the best choice, as I intermittently had to pause Netflix to contribute my own liquified form of the Mind-Flayer, but it got the job done, and I cried my way thru Dustin and Suzie's hymn to childhood, again, as expected.</p>
<p>Okay, next, I woke up on September 9th. My appointment is around 2 PM. Normal day, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I decide to walk over to the UCSF Parnassus building in the creepy Mars firelight, imagining I'm the last man on Earth (and hoping I don't step on my reading glasses). Carly makes a plan to pick me up in a few hours in our car.</p>
<p>As expected, the procedure was painless. My only bit of further colonoscopy advice here is to ALWAYS bring a book with you, to every single medical appointment you have, because there's always going to be some sort of delay or waiting room.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, I woke up feeling the feels of that post-anesthesia giddiness. Except no one else was happy. Carly was in the room, a surprise to me. And my doctor looked quite serious.</p>
<p>In addition to two small polyps (which she removed), my colonoscopy surgeon found a tumor in my sigmoid colon. At this point, I don't know a sigmoid colon from a semi-colon, but I knew it wasn't good news. Go 2020!</p>
<p>Despite the odds (my youth, my health), I now had cancer. Well, I probably had it for awhile, but we just found out I had it.</p>
<p>My doc said I'd need to meet with <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/center-for-colorectal-surgery">UCSF's colorectal surgery team</a>, and I'd also need to get CT scans ("cat scans") to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else in my body.</p>
<p>And so began one of the worst weeks of our lives.</p>
<h2>A brief family history</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the odds for a moment.</p>

<p>We've already discussed my vigorous, proto-Batman level of health. And how I'm a fresh-faced, occasionally-bearded, 34 year old with the heart of a child and the strength of a chimpanzee (no, that's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee">humanzee</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of unfortunate genetics, it turns out that I have some family history of colon cancer. </p>
<p>Here's the scoop: my pops (that's cool talk for Dad) has had benign (non-cancerous) polyps in his previous colonoscopies. What's a poylp? It's a little growth thingy in your colon that may evolve into a tumor. Just like how a Charmander becomes a Charmeleon, polyps can grow bigger and more serious with more destructive power. Polyps are usually just snipped out during your colonoscopy and sent off for pathology (aka to see if they have cancer in them). Most do not. This is the case with my dad's polyp experience. Even though none of his have been cancerous, he still needs to go in for colonoscopies more regularly than those who don't have polyps.</p>
<p>My own tumor began as a lowly polyp, perhaps some ten years ago. We don't know exactly. But if I'd …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Big Oil Wants Climate Change</h3><p>In this post, we read, listen, act, and reflect on October's topic: Big Oil. This blog has been adapted from our sustainability newsletter, so please sign up for it to stay in the loop. </p><p>What’s covered: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>READ</em></strong><em>: Exxon's plan to increase emissions to match the country of Greece's CO2 output</em></li><li><strong><em>LISTEN</em></strong><em>: The climate conspiracy funded by Big Oil</em></li><li><strong><em>ACT</em></strong><em>: Coming 10/21</em></li><li><strong><em>REFLECT</em></strong><em>: Coming 10/28</em></li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div><h3>This week's conversation starter</h3><p>‍</p><p>This prompt is for you to ask your friends and family - especially if they're thinking about climate change less than you are. I'll share one every week.</p><p>What do you think about renewable energy? Have you considered using it?</p><p>‍</p><h3>READ: Facts about Exxon and Big Oil</h3><p>The following is taken from this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/exxon-carbon-emissions-and-climate-leaked-plans-reveal-rising-co2-output">Bloomberg</a> report and this <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/05/leaked-documents-reveal-exxonmobil-plans-to-increa/">Motley Fool</a> article (I recommend reading the Bloomberg one). Both articles reference a leaked Exxon internal document.</p><p>Exxon put out a press release claiming that the Bloomberg report is misleading, but I think I'll take my chances and stand by this report. You can read Exxon's statement <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1005_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-inaccurate-Bloomberg-news-story">here</a>.</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Exxon has an ambitious plan... to increase fossil fuel production.</strong> Their own assessment of their $210 billion investment strategy shows yearly CO2 emissions rising 17% by 2025. Yes, <em>rising</em>.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Exxon wants to compete with Greece, I guess?</strong> This "ambitious" plan would increase their annual emissions by as much as the output of the ENTIRE NATION of Greece. That's a whole country!<br>‍</li><li><strong>The number is an underestimate.</strong> Basically, Exxon wants to ramp up oil production. This would <em>increase</em> CO2 emissions by 21 million metric tons by 2025. This doesn't account for what they already emit. (Emission, more like omission, amirite?) Exxon's leaked documents estimate total emissions of 143 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2025.<br>‍</li><li><strong>They're trying to sneak past you.</strong> They talk big game about their emissions reduction strategy, but that's to distract you from the fact that they emit WAY more than they reduce — the reduction is likely just a publicity play at this time.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>There's good news, though. Plus, more info on the history of this colossal problem. Sources are linked if you want to learn more.</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>There's good news!</strong> Exxon's competitors, like Shell and BP, have <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/04/16/net-zero-emissions-shell-oil-industry-gas/">committed</a> to net-zero emissions targets by 2050 because of shareholder demands. Putting pressure on corporations works and it's one of the best ways we can take action as individuals. I'm here to show you how.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Only 20 companies have contributed to a third of all CO2 emissions.</strong> Yeah, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions">here's the list.<br>‍</a></li><li><strong>We let this happen because of </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/15/united-states-spend-ten-times-more-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-than-education/#5ffb994c4473"><strong>politics</strong></a><strong> and capitalism</strong>. Fossil fuel companies get hella money from the government. In the US, fossil fuel subsidies are greater than federal education spending. I'll talk more about the link between politics, money, and Big Oil in a later module.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div><h3>This week's conversation starter</h3><p>‍</p><p>This prompt is for you to ask your friends and family - especially if they're thinking about climate change less than you are. I'll share one every week.</p><p><strong><em>Why do you think our weather patterns change from year to year? What's the wildest weather event you've experienced in your life?</em></strong></p><p>‍</p><h3>LISTEN: How powerful is Big Oil?</h3><p><br>Confession: I didn't know about climate deception until earlier this year. I mean, I knew that oil companies were kinda responsible for covering up climate change, but I didn't understand that it was a whole ass conspiracy theory.</p><p><br>The main video I wanted to share with you below has more facts, but I <em>had</em> to show you this 3-minute one for #ConspiracyVibes. Honestly, it almost seems fake with all the eerie background music. I wish it was.</p><p><br>So,<strong> option 1</strong>, watch the spooky video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMd6hE6Rr6M&amp;ab_channel=TheYEARSProject&amp;utm_source=Soapbox+Project&amp;utm_campaign=8cc7aba228-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_10_14_06_25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_62cc86bc0a-8cc7aba228-" target="_blank">Big Oil Knew: The Confusion Memo.</a> It's short and has a good timeline on how Exxon and its buddies created a decades-long cover up that's made its way to the American White House today.</p><p><br><strong>Option 2:</strong> Watch this other NowThis video "How Powerful is Big Oil?" I've embedded it below, and if you keep scrolling, I've included 3 facts to encourage you to watch. It's only 3 min - you might as well exit out of this newsletter and check out the video, since it's basically the same amount of time.</p><figure id="w-node-b6d1509964ec-c0ebf208"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DIHIP2hHIE"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Fact snack | Video Recap</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Trillionaire, baby:</strong> Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States (in that order) are the largest global oil producers. The top 5 oil companies' revenues accounted for over 10% of US GDP — about 2 trillion USD! Yes, <em>five</em> companies' revenues equated to a tenth of US GDP. If you're not from the US, that translates to "I'm so rich I can do whatever I want without consequences".<br> </li><li><strong>Swaying elections is easy... with enough money.</strong> Oil companies in 2016 gave ~57 MILLION bucks to the political campaign. As we know, the election of the US president has far-reaching global consequences. Oh, and over 50 of that million went to the Republican party.<br> </li><li><strong>Each year, approximately 4 BILLION in taxpayer dollars is given back to oil companies.</strong> So basically, oil companies are hella rich, they have seemingly unlimited political power, and the money that they give to politicians is barely a cost to them because they get it right back.</li></ul><p><br>Today's Changeletter was a bit doom and gloom, but I just want to let it sink in that we can only substantially fight climate change when we act on a corporate level. And I see y'all out there with your corporate employers - but don't worry. We'll help you make a plan, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/125283609649/?utm_source=Soapbox+Project&amp;utm_campaign=8cc7aba228-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_10_14_06_25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_62cc86bc0a-8cc7aba228-" target="_blank">starting with our voting party.</a></p><p>‍</p></div><div id="act"><h3>ACT: 3 baby steps to take down the bad guy, Big Oil</h3><p>‍</p><p> It seems like Big Oil was the right topic to pick this month. In our Listen module, we talked about how much unchecked power they have and a few days ago, the President of the United States "hypothetically" asked Exxon for a $25 million campaign donation. Exxon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-exxon-mobil-fundraising-call-claim-never-happened-2020-10">denied it</a>, just like they <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1005_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-inaccurate-Bloomberg-news-story">denied</a> wanting to increase CO2 emissions this year.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Today, I'm listing out 3 actions you can take towards the fight for a greener, less oil-dependent future. </strong></p><p>‍</p><p>It's time to end our reliance on Big Oil. It'll take a while to get there, but we can start in reeeaaaallly easy ways. I've done all three of these only after COVID started, so I&nbsp;believe in you to also take the first step. Please reach out if you need more resources -- we're here for you at team@soapboxproject.org or on social media.</p><p>‍</p><p>Anyway, here it is, easy, medium, and medium-advanced:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Divest from Big Oil.</strong> Do you have oil and gas stocks in your portfolio? Can you switch them out for renewable energy stocks and ETFs? Check out these <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/renewable-energy-stocks-to-consider">recommendations</a> and let me know what you think.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Switch your bank.</strong> A majority of investment banks including Chase <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/03/18/jpmorgan-chase-tops-dirty-list-of-35-fossil-fuel-funding-banks/#615a76515dfe">invest heavily in fossil fuels.</a> I recently used <a href="https://mightydeposits.com/">Mighty Deposits</a> to find a bank that works for me — instead of investing in dirty energy, my money is going towards building community and boosting small businesses.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Use less plastic.</strong> You're probably slammed this week with emails/calls/texts from political campaigns.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I just ran into a thought-provoking little issue in the source code of
HyperRogue, and I thought I’d share it here.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue">HyperRogue</a> is quite possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004073813/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/28/hyperrogue-non-euclidean-roguelike/">the
most mind-expanding roguelike in existence</a>.
And it’s written 100% in C++! Even the web version is
compiled with <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html">Emscripten</a>.
Okay, there’s about 2000 lines of Java for the Android version, but the
bulk of the code — 135,000 lines — is C++.</p>

<p>The code’s native language is C++11; that is, it uses lots of C++11 (<code>unordered_map</code>,
<code>std::move</code>, variadic templates) but it doesn’t use any C++14 features (it used one
generic lambda for a while, but I submitted a patch to remove it, and the patch was
accepted). So it’s C++11, and <em>also</em> it’s C++14.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>quite</em> C++17.</p>

<p>Because it does this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>using namespace std;

template&lt;class T&gt; int size(const T&amp; x) {
    return x.size();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then it does things like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
  vptr[cl.lst[i]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(cl.lst[i])*C0, cl.dists[i]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, it’s C++11, but it’s not quite <em>idiomatic</em> C++11. It’s quite dense, and has a bit of a phobia
about ranged for-loops.</p>

<p>But then, everyone’s codebase has its idiosyncrasies. When the end result
is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7QO9sypSfM&amp;t=5m29s">this good</a>, you can’t complain too much
about the author’s whitespace.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-problem">So what’s the problem?</h2>

<p>The problem is that C++17 introduces <code>std::size</code>. So Clang complains:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>./rug.cpp:585:18: error: call to 'size' is ambiguous
  for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
                 ^~~~
/usr/include/c++/v1/iterator:1584:16: note: candidate
      function [with _Cont = std::__1::vector&lt;hr::cell *, std::__1::allocator&lt;hr::cell *&gt; &gt;]
constexpr auto size(const _Cont&amp; __c) -&gt; decltype(__c.size()) { return __c.size(); }
               ^
./hyper.h:400:23: note: candidate function [with T = std::__1::vector&lt;hr::cell *, std::__1::allocator&lt;hr::cell *&gt; &gt;]
template&lt;class T&gt; int size(const T&amp; x) {return x.size(); }
                      ^
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clang complains about 600 times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git grep '[^.&gt;a-zA-Z0-9_]size(' | wc -l
     587
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the author tried <a href="https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue/commit/d3200253db6866ed278540e136a7464e14c1d11a">replacing <code>using namespace std;</code> with a list of explicit <code>using</code>-directives</a>.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t help. We’re getting something we don’t expect out of <code>namespace std</code>,
but it’s not because we <code>using</code>ed the namespace. It’s because of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup (ADL)</a>.
We made an unqualified call to <code>size</code>, where one of the arguments was a <code>std::vector</code>. This unqualified call,
by ADL, naturally finds any function named <code>size</code> in any <em>associated namespace</em> of the argument type
<code>std::vector</code> (and, incidentally, also considers namespace <code>hr</code>, although
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0934r0.pdf">this has been widely regarded as a bad move</a>.)</p>

<p>So eliminating the <code>using namespace std;</code> directive is a great idea but doesn’t help at all.</p>

<h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h2>

<p>I thought of a bunch of alternatives.</p>

<p>(A), we could change the name of our <code>size</code> function from <code>size</code> to <code>Size</code> (or <code>sz</code>, or <code>hrsize</code>, or whatever).
Update all the call-sites, and we’re done. This continues performing ADL on every call-site, but now ADL
doesn’t find any functions named <code>Size</code> (or whatever) <em>except</em> for the one we intend, so we’re good.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;Size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr>

<p>(B), we could leave our <code>size</code> function alone, and fully-qualify every <em>call</em> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;::size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This says, “Please look <em>only</em> in the global namespace for <code>size</code>” — that is, it turns off ADL entirely.
So we’re good.</p>

<p>Minor digression: Super C++ geeks might have noticed that <code>&lt;:</code> is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_alternative">digraph</a>,
so that in C++03 the above code would have been parsed as a syntax error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i[:size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has been fixed since C++11: <code>&lt;::</code> is a sort of a “trigraph” that overrides the usual meaning
of <code>&lt;:</code> in the same way as <code>&lt;:</code> overrides the usual meaning of <code>&lt;</code>. The underlying mechanism is similar
to how C++11 doesn’t get confused by the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in <code>set&lt;set&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>(C), we could simply ifdef out our global <code>size</code> whenever we’re in C++17 mode. Then our call sites will
do ADL lookup on <code>size</code>, and find only <em>one</em> candidate: <code>std::size</code>. So they’ll be happy. But this
comes with two downsides.</p>

<p>First, it’s surprisingly hard to detect “C++17 mode” in this case. The system Clang on my MacBook
doesn’t support <code>-std=c++17</code> yet; it only has <code>-std=c++1z</code>, which doesn’t increase the value of
the <code>__cplusplus</code> macro. So we can’t reliably test for <code>__cplusplus &gt;= 201703L</code>. But we can work around
this by adding a config macro <span><code>-DUSE_STDSIZE</code></span> or whatever.</p>

<p>Second, HyperRogue’s global function template <code>size</code> is not a drop-in replacement for <code>std::size</code>!
<code>std::size</code> returns <code>size_t</code>; our global <code>size</code> returns <code>int</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>./rug.cpp:585:17: warning: comparison of integers of different signs: 'int' and 'decltype(__c.size())' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wsign-compare]
  for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
               ~^~~~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could work around <em>that</em> by passing <code>-Wno-sign-compare</code>, but then we’d miss bugs.
Or we could add an explicit cast to <code>int</code> in any of several ways:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  for(int i=0; i&lt;(int)size(cl.lst); i++)

  for(int i=0; i&lt;int(size(cl.lst)); i++)

  for(int i=0; i&lt;static_cast&lt;int&gt;(size(cl.lst)); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that we’d need to add those explicit casts even in places the compiler <em>didn’t</em> complain.
Otherwise Murphy’s Law says that we’d hit at least one instance of something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>auto i = size(vec);
double d = foo();
double negated_if_empty = d * (i - 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we don’t want to audit all 587 call-sites looking for things like that.</p>

<hr>

<p>(D) — an improvement on (C) — we could eliminate our global <code>size</code> <em>and</em> all its call-sites.
Just inline what it would have done, in C++17 and C++11 alike.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  for(int i=0; i&lt;(int)cl.lst.size(); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is my preferred solution, since it turns out that we can implement it as a series of
mechanical replacements using <code>sed</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sed -i -e 's/size(\*it)/it-&gt;size()/g' langen.cpp
sed -i -e 's/\([^a-z]\)size(\([a-zA-Z0-9_.:][][a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*\))/\1(int)\2.size()/g' `find . -name '*.cpp'` *.h
sed -i -e 's/\([^a-z]\)size(\([a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*-&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9_.:][][a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*\))/\1(int)\2.size()/g' *.cpp
sed -i -e 's/size(currentmap-&gt;allcells())/(int)currentmap-&gt;allcells().size()/g' *.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does introduce a lot of redundancy; for example, it rewrites</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if(size(str) == 0) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>into</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if((int)str.size() == 0) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>when a human being would have rewritten it as</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if(str.empty()) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But at least it gets the thing compiling in C++17 mode without breaking C++11 mode, and
we can go back and fix up individual call-sites on an ad-hoc basis the next time that particular
area of the code is being worked on.</p>

<hr>

<p>(E), we could do that ad-hoc work right now. For example, our original example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
  vptr[cl.lst[i]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(cl.lst[i])*C0, cl.dists[i]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>could be rewritten by hand into</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (auto ld : hr::zip(cl.lst, cl.dists)) {
  vptr[ld[0]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(ld[0])*C0, ld[1]);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>with an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8511035/sequence-zip-function-for-c11">appropriate definition</a>
of <code>zip</code>. (And notice that we’re <code>::</code>-qualifying the call, so that we won’t have to
do this whole thing over again when <code>std::zip</code> inevitably arrives in a future standard!)</p>

<p>But this is basically saying “let’s do a code audit on 587 ad-hoc call sites,” which
isn’t super enticing.</p>

<h2 id="dont-do-that-then">Don’t do that then</h2>

<p>In our case we actually got <em>lucky</em> that our code failed to compile.
The absolute worst case would have been if our global <code>size</code> (returning a signed type)
were <em>silently a worse match</em> than C++17’s <code>std::size</code> (returning an unsigned type),
so that all our math silently went wrong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, C++ doesn’t have a really great solution here. Future standards can add
names into <code>namespace std</code>, which can then break your existing code’s unqualified calls
by causing unwanted ADL.</p>

<p>The only answer I can really think of is — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri3aL8At44I&amp;t=1m25s"><em>Don’t do that, then.</em></a>
Just like in my <code>zip</code> example above: in our C++ programs, we need to maintain a good
intuitive sense for when some unqualified name (like <code>begin</code>, or <code>size</code>, or <code>zip</code>)
is <em>likely</em> to get stepped on in a future standard, and <em>avoid using that name today</em>,
even if it has not <em>yet</em> been stepped on.
This is arguably a very unfortunate state of affairs… but it’s the state of affairs
we’ve got.</p>

<p><em>Avoid making ADL calls to functions with common names.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE, 2019-05-20:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/commit/61603736e7c9092e0df68d4dd8c87f33eb2e603d">LLVM/Clang just ran into the same issue with a function named <code>apply</code>.</a></p>

<p>Two years ago, we set out to build the best search engine for JavaScript developers. Pika — the original project codename — was designed to help you find better open source packages using data and insights that other search engines ignored. Package size, number of dependencies, side effects, ability to bundle &amp; tree-shake efficiently… Pika analyzed every package to help you make the best choice in less time.</p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to launch our v2 search engine featuring <strong><a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack Discover</a></strong>. Discover combines human-reviewed package recommendations with a quality-focused. search algorithm to help you find the best JavaScript packages, faster than ever.</p>



<h3>Solving the open source discovery problem</h3>



<p>Javascript has evolved, but the way that we find packages is still far too time-consuming. Finding the right package for your project involves a wild dance between <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>, Google, “this vs. that” blog posts, <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">bundlephobia</a>, <a href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/">dependency tree visualizers</a>, Quora, Stack Overflow… </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="455" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png 1000w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-300x137.png 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>An actual issue that I was once assigned at work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re in a rush, you might just grab the most popular package and hope for the best. For example, the #1 recommended “date/time” package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=date%20time%20">npm’s official search engine</a> would be the popular package named “moment”. You install it, build on top of it, deploy your site to production, and… BAM! <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721">Google’s official auditing tool throws a warning</a> when you go to test your website before launch:</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhM0XE3UwAA2Co5?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Replace unnecessarily large JavaScript libraries"></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani</a>: “Lighthouse in @ChromeDevTools now recommends smaller libraries that improve bundle size.</em>“</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out, popularity and search algorithms only tell half of the story. A search algorithm can’t tell you that earlier this year the official Moment.js docs were also updated to say: <em>“<a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/">We would like to discourage Moment from being used in new projects going forward.”</a></em></p>



<p>Finding the right package for your project requires <strong>context. </strong>If a package claims to be widely-used, it’s essential to look deeper. Is it still popular today? Is it well-maintained? Or, has something better come along? Has it been abandoned by the original author? </p>



<p>Gathering this context yourself is a time consuming and imperfect process. So, we decided to bring the context to you.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-768x401.jpg 768w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Skypack Discover: Recommended packages, curated by humans</h3>



<p>Skypack Discover is a curated, up-to-date list of the top recommended packages for popular search terms. It’s like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">Wirecutter</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9416579/spotify-discover-weekly-online-music-curation-interview">Spotify playlists</a>, but for open source JavaScript.</p>



<p>Skypack Discover cuts through the noise to surface the best packages that match your search. We look at factors like package size, performance, documentation, quality, degree of maintenance, community support and more. If a popular package has been abandoned or better alternatives exist, you won’t find it in Discover.</p>



<p>In addition to package recommendations, you also get additional resources linked directly in your results page: relevant blog posts, articles, video walkthroughs and documentation can all help you make your package decision faster and easier.</p>



<p>Today, over 100 popular search terms feature Skypack Discover results. Starting next month, we’ll begin publishing detailed write-ups of our recommendations: how we arrived at our top picks and our thinking behind them.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, it’s up to you to choose the best package for your project. And now, Skypack Discover can help.</p>



<h3>Skypack CDN: Try out any package, right in the browser</h3>



<p>Installing and testing a package locally can introduce an entirely new struggle, best documented in this <a href="https://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/">brutally honest experience</a> by Lea Verou.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png" alt="" width="966" height="150" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png 740w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px"><figcaption>CDN code snippets on every package page!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Skypack makes trying out packages so much easier with a ready-to-go <a href="http://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack CDN</a> link on every package page. With Skypack CDN, you can load and run any package directly in the browser, on demand. There’s nothing to install and no tools to run. As long as the package wasn’t designed for the server, it should run on Skypack.</p>



<p>To try out a package yourself, find it on <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack.dev</a> and then click the “Edit on CodePen” button on the package page. You’ll be instantly transported to a full <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> IDE containing your Skypack import, ready to go. <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> runs entirely in the browser, so there’s no slow startup or unnecessary wait-time required. Just an instant IDE, ready to play.</p>

Tweet us a link to the CodePen!</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Skypack: the future of Pika</h3>



<p>We started Pika almost <a href="https://www.pika.dev/changelog#December%204,%202018">two years ago</a> with a simple mission: make modern JavaScript more accessible. The world of web development looks very different today, and some of the wild ideas that we introduced back in 2018 are now mainstream. We can’t wait to continue this mission into the future with Skypack.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app here, I want to start this blog post with a disclaimer:</p>
    <p>This describes a <em>minor</em> security flaw in the app which has no impact on its ability to function as part of a track &amp; trace system. I also want to be explicitly clear that this bug does not have any privacy impact whatsoever. Lastly, there is nothing nefarious about this bug. It's a mistake (largely on the part of a third-party dependency) and nothing more, one that is easily (and commonly) made.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 Android app, the official contact tracing app for England and Wales, uses signed JWT tokens for its “scan into a venue” feature but does not properly validate the signatures, meaning anyone could have forged their own venue QR codes.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is due to a mixture of JWTs being fundamentally difficult to verify correctly, and a particularly awful JWT library API.</p>

<p>I was able to discover the vulnerability from reading the source code, and getting the relevant app code running on my computer in a test harness to experiment with it.</p>

<p>I reported the vulnerability to the NHS team who fixed it very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The Full Story</h2>

<p>It all started, as many things do, with <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361">a Tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>okay i actually really wanted to know and its a JWT with</p><p>like</p><p>the whole dang address</p><p>and the name of the place just for shits and giggles <a href="https://t.co/1vx0bTD9zi">pic.twitter.com/1vx0bTD9zi</a></p></div>— laura mcflurry (@freezydorito) <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2020</a></blockquote>


<div><p>For those of you who don't know, these QR codes are for venues (such as pubs and bars) to display so customers can check in via the NHS (National Health Service) mobile app. This makes it faster and more convenient to track who was at the venue, in case they need to be contacted in the event someone else there tested positive for Coronavirus.</p></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the NHS venue QR codes are JWTs, and they are cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Like anyone in security, as soon as I heard the letters “JWT” I thought: “I wonder if they got the signature checking correct”.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: they didn’t:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle.png"><img src="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle-thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of a mobile phone app: Green check mark. Title: Successful check-in. Large text: Barnard Castle Eye Testing Facility. Smaller test: 30 Sep 2020, 12:53. Thank you for scanning. You have now checked in! You'll be automatically checked out at midnight or when you scan another official NHS QR code. Button: Back to home. Link: Cancel this check-in."></a></p>

<h2 id="background-jwts--signing">Background: JWTs &amp; Signing</h2>

<p>In case you don’t know what a JWT is, it’s an entirely unnecessary and rather over-complicated spec for encoding data in JSON format and: cryptographically signing it, so it cannot be altered; encrypting it, so it cannot be read; both; or – popularly (if accidentally) – neither.</p>

<p>This post is about signed JWTs, and forging signed JWTs, so I’m not going to mention encryption any more. From here on in, every time I say “JWT” I mean “unencrypted, but possibly signed, JWT”.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything about JWTs to follow along here, but you do need to know this much: A JWT consists of three parts: a , a <span>payload</span>, and a <span>signature</span> (optional). Here’s an example:</p>

<pre>.<span>eyJuYW1lIjoiem9mcmV4IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6ImhlbGxvLCB3b3JsZCEifQ</span>.<span>40IhxsQj3rVqfQSpdzZTroSs1onXrTJUsy6yC1SadK0</span></pre>

<p>Each part is Base64 encoded, which isn’t important here, and decoded it looks like this:</p>

<pre>.<span>{"name":"zofrex","message":"hello, world!"}</span>.&lt;<span>inscrutable crytographic soup&gt;</span></pre>

<p>The header tells whoever is verifying the JWT which cryptographic algorithm was used to sign it (“alg”), and optionally an identifier for the key it was signed with (“kid”).</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that JWTs are shoe-horned into being a solution for, and one very common one is for verifying data that is passed between services by an untrusted user. For example, service A produces a token and gives it to a user, who then presents the token to service B. Because the token is round-tripping through the user, it is important to make sure they haven’t altered it (or created it themselves), and the token really was generated by the first service.</p>

<p>In the context of the NHS App, “service A” is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">website that generates QR codes for venues to display</a>, and “Service B” is the NHS COVID-19 app. There are actually multiple untrusted users carrying the QR code from service A to service B: the venue owner who prints out the QR code and sticks it up on the wall, and any customers who scan the QR code with their phone. Because of the cryptographic signature, the app can verify that the QR code it scans really was created by the official website.</p>

<p>That’s the theory.</p>

<p>In security and cryptography circles, JWTs used in this way are practically synonymous with “alg=none” bugs. Remember that “alg” field in the header earlier? One of the options is “none”. This, as you may have guessed already, means no verification occurs. This has proven to be the single biggest footgun in the JWT specification, as despite seemingly being a very obvious trap to avoid, many JWT libraries out there hide these details from users and make it very easy to accidentally allow the “none” algorithm.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that this is <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">hilariously and depressingly common</a>, and well worth double-checking if you are investigating any system that uses JWTs or, heaven help you, building one. That’s why this was my first thought upon learning the NHS app uses JWTs, and why I wanted to check if they made this specific mistake.</p>

<h2 id="lets-take-a-look">Let’s Take A Look</h2>

<p>Both the NHS apps (Android and iOS) <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01157/en-us?parentid=CAT-01028&amp;rootid=CAT-01024">are open source</a>, so it’s very easy for someone like me –&nbsp;more accustomed to reading/writing source code than reverse engineering – to take a look. A quick search for “JWT” in each repo later and we find:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-ios-ag-public/blob/a15cebbda5c073f1e0f7b266105110d0d88a7b27/NHS-COVID-19/Core/Sources/Domain/CheckIn/Model/QRCode.swift">The iOS app</a>:</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(I’ve omitted code not relevant to the signature checking)</p>

<p>This looks fine. Sure, it’s a little bit weird to do the key checking yourself rather than defer to a JWT library for it. But on the other hand, it’s extremely obvious reading this code that it’s doing the right thing, at least as far as alg=none avoidance goes (I cannot vouch for the cryptography, however. I’m just an alg=none expert).</p>

<p>The key part here is that the signing algorithm is hardcoded to P256, so setting alg to “none” in the JWT itself will have no effect on verification. Additionally the key to use is also hardcoded: it’s passed in to the class via the constructor. The “kid” (key id) field in the JWT is <em>checked</em>, but ultimately thrown away. The JWT is not trusted to choose the algorithm or the key, and in that sense this is a great example of how to safely use JWTs, if you do absolutely have to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the payload of the JWT is not decoded or used at all until after the signature is verified. This isn’t really relevant to the alg=none issue, but it is good practice in general to only access signed data after verifying that it hasn’t been tampered with. In cryptography, this protects you from <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">clever cryptographic attacks</a>. With JWTs it ensures you don’t accidentally use attacker-provided data for any decisions in your code if the signature fails, and has a side-benefit of creating a layered defence to exploiting the JSON parser (historically a decent source of bugs).</p>

<p>Anyway, this code looks fine. Great! <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/blob/2e37797b9b7b5db5b393280a9ef8b93a19af4964/app/src/main/java/uk/nhs/nhsx/covid19/android/app/qrcode/QrCodeParser.kt">On to Android</a> (again, I’ve omitted irrelevant code):</p>

<p>Phew, there’s a lot more going on here! Let’s break it down:</p>

<p>We start in the <code>parse</code> function and after some basic data juggling, we parse the JWT. Then we check if the signature is correct, and if it isn’t, we bail:</p>

<p>It was in the last great recession that I started doing contract software development, about 2008-2010. The bubble didn’t burst with as much force and shrapnel as in 2000, but it had a distinct dampening of the animal spirits of SOMA, San Francisco where all the startups lived. </p>



<p>It was somewhat by design. The previous job I had, writing Java and ActionScript for a marketing research company was chill enough but felt aimless. I had so little motivation I ended up coasting for a few months and playing a lot of pingpong. I wanted some new challenges, so decided to go freelance.</p>



<p>The first gig I got was off of Craigslist, although I imagine these days Upwork would be a better place to look for work. The project was very limited in scope; mostly adding a Google Maps visualization on top of some grant data for a nonprofit. It was a couple weeks of work, a couple grand, and time to move on.</p>



<p>Some time later a former colleague of mine hired me for some development work at a SF startup doing IP telephony combined with podcasting. This was 2009 so nobody had ever heard of podcasts and smartphones were still a fresh new technology people weren’t entirely sure what to do with. The gig was a fun challenge – enabling people to listen to and produce podcasts using only a telephone, no apps involved. I ended up developing some pretty innovative software that resembled a web framework but for touch tone and interactive voice response (IVR) phone applications. We successfully moved the application from an expensive managed solution to our own in-house platform that I designed, significantly cutting down operating costs.</p>



<p>After some time working on that project, I met a couple of guys who wanted to build a SEO-optimized directory of medical professionals, starting with Spanish-speaking plastic surgeons. I said I could cobble together a search engine in my spare time and was engaged. Some days I would walk the two blocks over from the small telephony company office to the small office housing the nascent doctor directory business and show my progress.</p>



<p>It seemed clear at the time that the podcasting telephony company while highly experimental, was professionally run. It had not one but two Stanford business school co-CEOs running it, with what amounted to a successful track record in the form of an early dot-com electronic greeting card company. Remember those? Weird shit. There were respectable investors, a small team of smart and highly competent professionals, and a beautiful office on Howard St. I recall situated on the floor below our office sat a little room consisting of no furniture save a well-stocked bar with never any people in sight, and a sign on the door reading “GitHub.” I felt like great things could happen.</p>



<p>In contrast, my side gig seemed like some small-time SEO hustling along with a smaller team and paycheck and no Stanford business vibes or major VC funding. I didn’t see anything wrong with that, and still tried to do a professional job, but it seemed like more of a dead end compared to the “real” engineering I was doing, fighting battles with touchy open-source PBX software and voice recognition grammars.</p>



<p>Then things turned out completely differently from what I expected. The doctor directory project kept growing, expanding, and taking on a life of its own. We got a proper office at 1st and Mission, hired an engineer, a designer, a salesperson. Plastic surgeons were mostly ditched, and now we were primarily helping American dentists establish a presence on this new “world wide web” technology they couldn’t quite wrap their heads around. This contacting gig that I imagined would consist of a couple months of basic work kept growing and there was always more work to do. Without any planning or expectations it turned into a real company, with eventually a staff of 25 talented and terrific people and an extremely respectable office in the Financial District. We built software to help all kinds of small medical practices in the US manage their patient communication, from appointment reminders to e-visits to actually useful online medical Q&amp;A. Six years later we sold the company to a large practice management software firm in Irvine, CA.</p>

<p>Following that experience my business partner John and I started a new company together again, this time on purpose. We started hiring and training some of the best young engineers, taking on projects and filling outstaffing needs for our clients, staffing a couple offices in Eastern Europe until covid forced us to go purely remote. This has in effect scaled up from my original single-person consulting operation into a powerhouse team of crack young engineers ready to take on complex software projects. </p>



<p>The classic Silicon Valley VC-backed, Stanford-connected, hip startup went nowhere, and closed its doors. I got permission to <a href="https://github.com/revmischa/asteryst">open-source</a> the IVR framework we built but little else came of it. As it happened, consulting across different clients helped me to gain a broader picture of what was actually possible and break my preconceived notions founded on image instead of substance. I accidentally ended up starting a company which went on to help make American health care just a little tiny bit less terrible, created a couple dozen jobs, and had the profound and unique experience of building up the software for a company starting completely from nothing up through due diligence and acquisition. Along the way I learned some lessons about software contracting I want to share with others who may be considering going <em>rōnin</em> and setting out on their own as freelancers.</p>



<h2>Tradeoffs and Considerations</h2>



<p>It’s my nature to think of everything in terms of trade-offs. Maybe because I have engineer-brain, or because I’m a libra, who knows. There are real benefits to consulting as opposed to being a full-time employee, but also some downsides.</p>



<h3>Legal Concerns</h3>



<p>In America at least, contracting means forming your own business, doing 1099 tax forms and racking up deductions, and drafting and reviewing contracts. It’s more effort and responsibility than being a full-time employee somewhere, as you’re now responsible for taxes and legal matters. Even if you’re not in America, being able to work across borders means creating a legal business entity.</p>



<p>I started by initially getting a DBA, or “Doing Business As” name, under which I could legally create contracts and other paperwork using an official-looking business name. Later on I “upgraded” to a California S-Corporation, which gives favorable tax treatment once your income reaches a certain threshold along with some legal liability protection. If your corporation is sued, all that can be collected usually is what the corporation has, shielding you personally to some degree. A Cali S-Corp will run you $800 a year not counting the time spent on paperwork and taxes you or your accountant/tax attorney will be doing.</p>



<p>Even getting a DBA or Fictitious Business Name is far from simple. In Contra Costa County for example:</p>



<blockquote><p>Within 30 days after a fictitious business name statement has been filed, the registrant shall cause it to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the fictitious business name statement was filed or, if there is no such newspaper in that county, in a newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county. If the registrant does not have a place of business in this state, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Sacramento County. The publication must be once a week for four successive weeks and an affidavit of publication must be filed with the county clerk where the fictitious business name statement was filed within 30 days after the completion of the publication.</p><cite><a href="https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/">https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>You don’t need to do this yourself necessarily, services like <a href="https://www.businessrocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BusinessRocket</a> can take care of business formation and taxes for a small fee.</p>



<p>One of the first things you’ll need to do is ask your friends for legal services recommendations. If you know anyone who is a contractor or a small business owner they probably have lawyers they work with and can recommend. Or you can hit me up. I enlisted the services of a business attorney to help me draft and review contracts, and a <a href="https://taxninja.com/">tax attorney</a> to take care of the corporation taxes and paperwork. Obviously lawyers are not cheap and in theory you can do all of this yourself, but they can also save you a great time of time and money as well by warning you about common pitfalls and fuckups, and suggest ways to better protect yourself or take advantage of favorable tax laws.</p>



<p>When you are going to agree to do work for a client they will want to know your hourly or project rate and a contract to sign. Understand that around a third to a half of your hourly rate is going to go to taxes, so adjust accordingly. A contract will need to have some important pieces of information. I highly suggest not listening to me and listening to an Actual Lawyer in your country or state about drafting a contract, but as far as software development you will typically need to include a “schedule of work.” This is the scope of what you will be expected to deliver in order to get paid.</p>



<p>Come at the schedule of work with a PM mindset – you have to figure out what the client actually wants and what actually needs to get built. If you end up needing to do more work outside of this scope then it can be a headache, and having a contract which spells out what you’ve been asked to do can make an effective backstop against scope creep. As a related matter, I highly suggest doing per-hour billing rather than doing projects for a fixed price whenever possible, because as we all know the best laid o’ work statement<em> </em>often go awry.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p><b>Code Browser</b> is a folding text editor for Linux and Windows, 
designed to hierarchically structure any kind of text file and especially source 
code. It makes navigation through source code faster and easier.

</p><center><img src="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/images/code-browser.png"></center>

<p>Code Browser is especially designed to keep a good overview of the code of 
large projects, but is also useful for a simple CSS file. 
Ideal if you are fed up of having to scroll through thousands of lines of code.

</p><p>See the <a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/code-folding.html">Introduction to Code Folding</a> page if you
want more information on text folding and the way it is implemented in Code Browser.

</p><p>It supports syntax highlighting for all major languages and custom syntax 
highlighting can also be added.

</p><p>Although Code Browser was initially designed to edit programs, it can 
also be used for different tasks such as plain text outlining or helping to understand
existing source code. I've added a page with suggestions to
<a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/tips.html">take advantage of folding</a>.

      Talking, Typing, Thinking: Software Is Not a Desk Job

      <summary>
        <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Developers over-optimise for the ergonomics of typing and not enough for the ergonomics of thinking.</p>
      </summary>

    <p>I had a wonderful shower the other day.</p>

<p>It was late morning (as the best showers often are) and I was reflecting on how I spend my time during the day. As a work-from-home consultant, I constantly need to justify my billing and my time, and in this case I was justifying spending more of it in the shower.</p>

<p>Like most of us, I started my career with the impression that a productive day was spent ergonomically poised over a keyboard typing hundreds of lines of code into Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition, and <em>not</em> standing in a perfectly hot stream of high pressure fresh water. However, the longer I spend as a developer, the less I’m convinced I need to be at my desk to deliver the truly astounding spreadsheet-to-web-application business value us senior engineering consultants deliver.</p>

<p>So that you too can justify spending the good part of a morning enveloped in a cocoon of cleansing warmth, let’s break this down and look at 5 physical activities of effective software development. Like all good listicles, this is ordered roughly in order of increasing time and importance.</p>

<h2 id="talking">5. Talking</h2>

<p>Some software development probably doesn’t need any talking to be effective. I understand for example that it is universally considered bad manners to talk about linux kernel development out loud. The contents of ~/bin too, we do not speak of.</p>

<p>But every commercial project I’ve worked on has needed at least some talking. When people are too busy or just too shy to talk, the lack of high-bandwidth communication can make it hard to tease out requirements and unpack poorly explained business problems.</p>

<p>But more importantly, a lack of talking makes it hard to build trust and rapport — critical&nbsp;in early stages of any new relationship. As social animals, we are particularly good at doing this verbally, and not particularly good at doing this with emails and spicy subtweets.</p>

<p>On the other hand I’ve worked on projects where talking is a prop to disguise that no-one knows what to do. Where a dozen people sit in a room and talk for an hour without saying anything and we all walk out dumber than when we walked in.</p>

<p>So for most cases: talking is critical, but in the right amount.</p>

<h2 id="listening">4. Listening</h2>

<p>Honestly I just included this for symmetry. The only thing I’ll add is that we have two ears and one mouth so either binaural hearing offers an evolutionary advantage against some selection pressure or we’re supposed to listen twice as much as we talk.</p>

<p>Take your pithy wisdom however you like it.</p>

<p><em>(quickly googles why do we have two ears)</em></p>

<h2 id="writing">3. Writing</h2>

<p>Writing code of course! But also… READMEs, comments, inline documentation, PR descriptions, code reviews, git commits; this is all part of the <em>core work</em>. It’s tempting to see this meta-writing as overhead on top of the real ‘code’ writing. But effective writing in these other places is a force multiplier for your code.</p>

<p>Much more importantly though, in my experience the best communication is written.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s async, meaning it can be consumed whenever convenient for each reader (i.e. after a late morning shower).</li>
  <li>It can be easily distributed and has no fidelity loss when shared (compared to talking to John about what Sarah told you Steve said in meeting that none of you were at).</li>
  <li>It creates a record, as opposed to “wait, why did we…?”</li>
  <li><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/">Writing is thinking</a>! Writing forces you to structure your ideas coherently (at least, it seems to for some people). It reveals shortcomings or gaps in your understanding or plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this I encourage team comms to be mostly written. Jira, slack, emails, trello, blog posts, whatever. Even a hi-res photo of a wall of post-it notes has been an indispensable architectural road-map at times. However it’s published, detailed, well-thought out writing is 💯.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more important than writing though is…</p>

<h2 id="reading">2. Reading</h2>

<p>Having just extolled the virtues of writing READMEs, commit messages, PR descriptions, etc, I should obviously encourage you to read them. It’s called README IN CAPITALS for a reason, and it’s not just because it’s an acronym. Yet if I had a dollar for every time someone asked me a question that was already answered in the README I would have three dollars. 💰</p>

<p>This is because of what I succinctly call the vicious-reading-writing-cycle-feedback-loop. When people don’t update the commentary, people become trained to ignore it, so people don’t update it, etc. Truthfully, if you know someone’s reading your git commits, their quality will rapidly improve. Even if you’ve never read a coherent git commit from your colleagues before, it’s never too late to ask them to elaborate on what <code>finally fix it</code> means.</p>

<p>But like writing, the value of reading extends well beyond the code repository.</p>

<p>I recently started a project involving a completely unfamiliar field of medical technology (ps you’re <a href="https://twitter.com/danielfone/status/1318026784454045703">still my favourite</a> patient <code>01-004</code> 📊❤️). The most valuable activity I find at this stage of a project is to read.</p>

<p>We have to parse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Format">specialised file format</a>, for which there is <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize">a gem</a>. But why leave all that useful context buried inside the gem? The <a href="https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edf.html">file specification</a> is not that long, even if it takes many attempts to understand it. Reading the file format spec makes it much easier to understand why the gem needs to <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize/blob/93566cdc82b160ef319c51908c1c4a19666e2625/lib/edfize/edf.rb#L243">load_digital_signals_by_epoch</a>, which in turn suggests alternative solutions to the problem you have in hand.</p>

<p>None of the <em>adjacent possible</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is discoverable without the insights gained from reading these sources, so whatever you’re dealing with, go to the source and read read read…</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation (<em>reading the very well-written <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">postgres manual</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/documentation">redis docs</a> is the closet experience I’ve had to Neo downloading kung-fu into his brain</em>)</li>
  <li>code (<em>vastly underrated - there’s not a gem in my Gemfiles I haven’t <code>bundle open</code>d at least once</em>)</li>
  <li>log files, error messages, that tutorial on how to read flame graphs</li>
  <li>the specification, legislation, policy document, NIST guideline, the original paper in the open access journal</li>
</ul>

<p>… you get the idea, just find the authoritative document and slurp it into your brain. Even if it seems like nothing sticks, a brief encounter with the text will leave a long-lasting impression. It’s like homeopathy but real.</p>

<p>So talking/listening… writing/reading… and finally… <em>drumroll noises</em></p>

<h2 id="thinking">1. Thinking</h2>

<p>When you boil it down, <em>this</em> is the main effort for me, and yet it’s kind of the hidden one.</p>

<p>How much of my programming/coding/dev time is actually just spent <em>thinking</em> about the problems?
Modelling the domain,
thinking through the edge cases,
mentally playing with abstractions.</p>

<p>And it’s obvious when you think about what makes good developers. The people I value working with most aren’t accurate typists, they’re <em>clear thinkists</em>.</p>

<p>Yet the image persists that typing is working and working is typing and a productive day is in your chair at your desk.
So we have dual 4k monitors, mechanical keyboards, aeron chairs, touchbar, vim shortcuts, whatever optimises for us tapping away at our computers.</p>

<p>But how much attention do we pay to the <strong>ergonomics of thinking</strong>?</p>

<p>When we elevate ‘thinking’ to core work, we naturally start to optimise for it specifically. In general, we don’t need to be in front of anything to think effectively, and often I find it better not to be. My times of greatest clarity are invariably when I’m moving, often when I’m exercising. Further, I can read on my phone practically anywhere, and the best conversations are often had while strolling.</p>

<p>So while I’m glad for all the ergonomics of my workspace, increasingly I find that writing code is the brief part where I’m simply harvesting all the mental crop that I’ve sown from the talking and listening and reading and thinking.</p>

<p>To distill this into something a little more alliterative, I have sometimes described this as the 3 Ts of software development…</p>

<h2>Talking · Typing · Thinking</h2>

<p><strong>Talking</strong> and listening; the verbal discussions. Most of the time we need a small but critical amount of high bandwidth synchronous comms.</p>

<p><strong>Typing</strong> code commentary: READMEs, code reviews, PR descriptions; and all asynchronous communication: project updates, technical overviews, emails with next steps; These are all an essential part of the job and not just ancillary or busywork. Also typing actual code at some point. But I find the more time you spend typing the other stuff, the less time you need to spend (re)typing code.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong>: (including, for the purposes of alliteration, reading)</p>

<p>Talking, typing, thinking: this is the work we do. And I for one want to give myself the space to do all parts of it really well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I gotta go take a shower. 🚿</p>

Lesson 5: Finding product/market fit from day one is fiction.</em></p><p><em>We’ll cover lessons 2 and 3 today. Let’s get this show on the road, yes?</em></p><p>When Brian moved to SF and decided to live with Joe to figure out what their billion-dollar startup was gonna be, he quickly learned that in order to make rent in SF, you have to sell a kidney. Probably both if you’re one of those fancy, pampered types that enjoys the finer things in life such as, you know, nutrition.</p><p>He didn’t have his part of the rent though ($1150).</p><p>But that weekend, there just so happened to be <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2016/sxsw-eco-award-winners-and-conference-highlights/" target="_blank">an international design conference at SXSW</a>, and they noticed that all the hotels on the website were listed fully booked.</p><p>They figured: well, designers are gonna have to stay somewhere, we don’t have the money to make rent, so what if we made a makeshift Bed and Breakfast?</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_29128"><div><p>But Brian and Joe didn’t have any beds. However, Joe had some airbeds leftover from camping so they changed their idea to an Airbed and Breakfast (Airbnb).</p><p>They ended up hosting a 35yr old woman from Boston, a 45yr old father of 5 from Utah, and a <a href="https://nextshark.com/meet-man-became-airbnbs-first-guest/" target="_blank">30yr old man from India</a>. Oh… and they made rent.</p><p><em>If you just want to read about Airbnb, skip the following section and pick back up at: BUILD SOMETHING SMALL THAT YOU WANT AND THINK IS DOPE.</em></p><p><strong>Notice that they weren’t trying to build a unicorn</strong>. They just needed to make rent and it seemed like a cool, fun thing to try.</p><p>This is a surprisingly common theme in startups. Travis made a similar remark about the origins of Uber:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>‘’When we first started it wasn’t about taking over the world. It wasn’t about taking on corruption in every city around the world. It was actually just about being baller in San Francisco.’’</p></blockquote><p><em>Because literally every POS article on Business Insider type websites doesn’t have the accurate quote and more annoyingly can’t be bothered with a source either, here it is:</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_32526"><div><p><em>Travis Kalanick at Startup School 2012 (2 years after founding Uber).</em></p><p>Back when computers were expensive, Woz built his own because he wanted one for himself. That was the origin of Woz, Jobs, and for 12 days Wayne’s, Apple.</p><blockquote><p>‘’I had no idea that I was taking exactly the right steps up this nice smooth ladder that leads up to the Apple II.’’</p></blockquote><p>Notice the nice smooth ladder he’s talking about. You start small and incrementally work your way up. You don’t start with the vision of the trillion-dollar Apple we have today.</p><blockquote><p>‘’I told my father: ‘Someday, I’m gonna own a 4K Nova Computer, so I can write programs.’ And he said: ‘That’ll cost as much as a house.’ And I said: ‘I’ll live in an appartment.’ I would rather have a computer in my life than a house.’’&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_36039"><div><blockquote><p>‘’I was giving away the schematics, passing them out. No copyright notices, no nothing. Passing out the listings of the code I wrote to other people in my club [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club" target="_blank">The Homebrew Computer Club</a>]. I was saying: ‘Here, you can build your own.’ And nobody really had the time to build it. And, so Steve Jobs came by and said: ‘Why don’t we make a PC board to save them the time to build it.’</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_38102"><div><p>There’s this idea that in order to change the world you have to start with the vision to cure cancer or build a quantum computer or something.</p><p>I don’t really like that approach. Maaaybe it’s useful for a second-time founder but for a first-time founder, I think it’s way too overwhelming.</p><p>When you’re ambitions are so grandiose, it’ll scare you into inaction.</p><p>We know from BJ Fogg’s work (2009) on behavior science that if ability is low (something is extremely hard to do), then even with high levels of motivation, behavior won’t occur. And reminders (called prompts) will just make you frustrated.&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s another problem too. Namely, there are just so many examples of solutions to tiny irritations that escalate into big companies.</p><p>There are a few reasons for that but one of them is that it brings clarity, simplicity, and focus. My favorite example of this is The Point vs. Groupon. [4]</p><p>So be open to solving small problems in your life. Yesterday I saw Mikael Cho, founder of Unsplash talk about this on Twitter. It’s a good reminder that small stuff really can become big.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_48211"><div><p>And if after that you’re still inspired to tackle the hard and obvious problems, you’ll be in a much more favorable position. [5]</p><p>They went from idea to execution fast. There was no complex infrastructure. No complicated back-end designed to handle the influx of millions of people. No, it was all very ghetto. We need to pay the rent, so can we get 3 people to <a href="https://nextshark.com/meet-man-became-airbnbs-first-guest/" target="_blank">pay us $80</a> to stay with us and sleep on our Airbeds during the conference?</p><p>Most of the time when founders do that stuff, it’s just another way to hide.</p><p>One of the best models we have today is the <a href="https://okdork.com/resources/validate-business/" target="_blank">Kagan Validation Model</a>: Get 3 paying customers in 48 hours without spending any money. (Sumo Group founder and early Facebook/Mint employee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OkDork" target="_blank">Noah Kagan</a>.)</p><p>Sure, that might eliminate ideas that would’ve worked had you spend more resources (false negatives). But it also prevents you from spending months or even years on ideas that are never gonna work (false positives).&nbsp;</p><p>Since the latter is a far more common problem, it’s more important to prevent that from happening.</p><p>By making the system overly sensitive, you’ll prevent wasting resources on ideas that’ll never work and the stuff that does make it through your filter is much more likely to succeed.</p><p>Think about it. If you can presell something based on a phone call then that leaves all the tools in your toolbox available to grow it. Whereas if you launch with the perfect product and marketing after years of refining it behind closed doors, then where exactly are you gonna take it from there? What’s left to optimize?</p><p>This does beg the question: ‘‘Why make the system overly sensitive in the first place? Why not adjust it so it’s perfect?’’ Because that’s not possible. There’s no way to create a system that will sort good ideas from bad ideas perfectly. So you’ll always have to be biased toward identifying good ideas and throwing away good ones that seemed bad (false negative) or identifying bad ideas and continuing to work on bad ideas that seem good (false positives).</p><p><em>This essay </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm" target="_blank"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a><em> goes into depth on how to think about false positives and negatives.</em></p><p><em>[4] From </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/startstartup" target="_blank"><em>The Right Way To Start A Startup</em></a><em>:</em></p><blockquote><p>Andrew at the NY Tech Meetup in 2008:</p><p>‘’The biggest mistake we made with The Point was being encumbered by this vision of what I wanted it to be. And taking 10 months to build the product and making all these assumptions of what people would want, that we then spend the next 10 months backtracking on. Instead of focussing on the one little piece of the product that people actually liked. </p><p>So, uhm, If there’s any advice that I have it’s you’re way too dumb to figure out if your idea is any good. It’s up to the masses. So build that very small thing and get it out there and keep on trying different things and eventually you’ll get it right.’’</p></blockquote><p><em>[5] Elon Musk is a role model for many founders nowadays but what he’s doing now is much less accessible than what Jack Dorsey, Drew Houston, or Mark Zuckerberg have done. In fact, it was so inaccessible that he couldn’t raise enough from investors. Which is why half a billion dollars in loans from the government was required. As for the hundreds of millions to kickstart Tesla and SpaceX? His own money. Which he made from… yup… internet startups. His first project was a small video game called Blastar.

	<p>Mobile phone reception</p>


	


	<p>Uninterrupted, good quality mobile phone reception is extremely important to rail passengers. In technical terms, it’s the pièce de résistance for every network provider because the demands on bandwidth increase with data-intensive applications. Swisscom has now successfully achieved a transmission speed of over 1 Gigabit per second on a moving train under test conditions. This result sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry.</p>

				<p>How do most people use their phones when on a train? Besides checking their mail and reading the paper, they also stream videos, play online games or work in virtual offices. This requires a great deal of bandwidth, meaning that capacity issues can prove particularly annoying. A Swisscom team has been researching and working on continuously improving mobile coverage for rail travellers and commuters for more than ten years.</p>

<p>The invention of a special type of glass for the train windows, which lets mobile telephone signals through, has made it possible to bring mobile coverage directly onto the train without intermediate components. However, coverage along train routes remains challenging as much more data is transmitted under the same conditions with each mobile phone generation. One possible solution is a specially designed antenna corridor along railway lines.</p>

				<p>Swisscom has now made a major breakthrough on a test route between Biberlikopf and Kerenzerberg at Lake Walen with a newly designed four-kilometre antenna corridor: Swisscom engineers achieved a connection with 1.2 Gbit/s on a moving train. Christoph Aeschlimann, Head of IT, Network &amp; Infrastructure at Swisscom says: “This concept sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry. Just one year ago, we had no idea whether this would be possible. We now have a solution that provides stable and reliable coverage for passengers as well as important insights for safety-relevant applications in rail transport.”</p>
<p>Another positive side effect is the lower transmitting power required due to the shorter distances between antennas and devices.</p>

		<p>After evaluating the results, the test corridor will be further optimised and validated with measurements in the first quarter of 2021. The long-term goal is to achieve uninterrupted mobile phone coverage along the main routes for all mobile phone users and providers in Switzerland In terms of the antenna corridor, Swisscom has developed a feasible solution that is also available to other providers.</p>

				<p>A four-kilometre antenna corridor was constructed along the railway line at Lake Walen for the test, in conjunction with network equipment supplier Ericsson. The proximity of the antenna to devices means the transmitting power is lower and the coverage along the railway corridor is more targeted.</p>

<p>In a step-by-step procedure, numerous combinations (4G and 5G mobile phone generations, seating position, type of train car, transmitting power, train windows, mast antennas, smartphone models, etc.) were measured and analysed over more than 200 train journeys. The project has shown that the antenna corridor is possible and offers good performance. Download speeds of over 1.2 Gbit/s were possible on a moving train with a combination of 4G and 5G. The 5G response time was four times shorter than 4G – an impressive 8 milliseconds.</p>

<p>In addition to network coverage, safety-critical applications on rail transport are another consideration. The existing GSM-R railway communication network standard will be replaced in the coming years by the new Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS). Good mobile phone coverage is also therefore crucial for rail companies as well as passengers.</p>

	<div>
		
<div><p>An interesting question came up on Stack Overflow recently that I suggested a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64338987/504554">hypothetical answer</a> for how to do hostname based proxying for MQTT.</p><p>In this post I’ll explore how to actually implement that hypothetical solution.</p></div>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>HTTP added the ability to do hostname based proxying when it instroduced the <code>Host</code> header in HTTP v1.1. This meant that a single IP address could be used for many sites and the server would decide which content to serve based on the his header. Front end reverse proxies (e.g. nginx) can use the same header to decide which backend server to forward the traffic to.</p>



<p>This works well until we need encrypt the traffic to the HTTP server using SSL/TLS where the headers are encrypted. The solution to this is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI</a> header in the TLS handshake, this tells the server which hostname the client is trying to connect to. The front end proxy can then either use this information to find the right local copy of the certificate/key for that site if it’s terminating the encryption at the frontend or it can forward the whole connection directly to the correct backend server. </p>



<h2>MQTT</h2>



<p>Since the SNI header is in the initial TLS handshake and is nothing to do with the underlying protocol it can be used for ay protocol, in this case MQTT. This measn if we set up a frontend proxy that uses SNI to pick the correct backend server to connect to.</p>



<p>Here is a nginx configuration file that proxies for 2 different MQTT brokers based on the hostname the client uses to connect. It is doing the TLS termination at the proxy before forwarding the clear version to the backend.</p>


<pre title="">user  nginx;
worker_processes  auto;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

stream {  
  map $ssl_server_name $targetBackend {
    test1.example.com  192.168.1.1:1883;
    test2.example.com  192.168.1.2:1883;
  }

  map $ssl_server_name $targetCert {
    test1.example.com /certs/test1-chain.crt;
    test2.example.com /certs/test2-chain.crt;
  }

  map $ssl_server_name $targetCertKey {
    test1.example.com /certs/test1.key;
    test2.example.com /certs/test2.key;
  }
  
  server {
    listen 1883         ssl; 
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2;
    ssl_certificate     $targetCert;
    ssl_certificate_key $targetCertKey;
        
    proxy_connect_timeout 1s;
    proxy_pass $targetBackend;
  } 
}
</pre>


<p>Assuming the the DNS entries for <code>test1.example.com</code> and <code>test2.example.com</code> both point to the host running nginx then we can test this with the <code>mosquitto_sub</code> command as follows</p>


<pre title="">$ mosquitto_sub -v -h test1.example.com -t test --cafile ./ca-certs.pem
</pre>


<p>This will be proxied to the broker running on <code>192.168.1.1</code>, where as </p>


<pre title="">$ mosquitto_sub -v -h test2.example.com -t test --cafile ./ca-certs.pem
</pre>


<p>will be proxied to the broker on <code>192.168.1.2.</code></p>



<h2>Cavets</h2>



<p>The main drawback with this approach is that it requires that all the clients connect using TLS, but this is not a huge problem as nearly all devices are capable of this now and for any internet facing service it should be the default anyway.</p>



<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>



<p>How to do this was mainly informed by the following <a href="https://gist.github.com/kekru/c09dbab5e78bf76402966b13fa72b9d2">Gist</a></p>

						<p>Science has two stark problems: replication and innovation. Many scientific findings aren’t reproducible. That is to say, you can’t be sure that another study or experiment on the same question would get similar results. At the same time, the pace of scientific innovation could be slowing down.</p>
<p>Does attempting to solve one problem make the other worse? Many have argued that policies seeking to avoid reproducibility issues will create a constrictive atmosphere that inhibits innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, top policymakers are worried about just this. Along with other prominent philanthropists and academics, I attended a White House meeting on scientific reproducibility early in 2020 (just before COVID-19 really hit). One of the key questions on a sheet of paper that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy circulated for discussion was whether a tradeoff existed: Would efforts to improve reproducibility risk harming the creativity and innovation of federally-funded research?</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> think there’s a contradiction between reproducibility and innovation. Contrary to common belief, we can improve <i>both</i> at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.</p>
<p>First, though, let’s take a step back, and briefly review the evidence that significant areas of science could be more reproducible and innovative.</p>
<h2><b>Is science reproducible?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>Many people have written about scientific irreproducibility over the past several decades. But the issue became more prominent in the mid-2000s with the publication of what soon became one of the most downloaded research papers of all time: The 2005 piece “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>,” by Stanford’s John Ioannidis. (Disclaimer: he is a long-time grantee of Arnold Ventures, where I work.)</p>
<p>To be sure, Ioannidis’s finding was mostly theoretical; it’s not as if he actually redid “most” published research (i.e., tens of millions of studies). Instead, he showed that given the way most studies are carried out, if journals have even a slight bias towards positive results (and they most definitely do), then most of the results that end up getting published would inevitably be statistical flukes or the results of p-hacking.</p>
<p>His theoretical case has been confirmed by many empirical studies in fields from drug development to psychology. Pharmaceutical companies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> have reported that they are unable to reproduce 80+% of experiments from prestigious journals. To quote Bayer’s scientists, “projects that were started in our company based on exciting published data have often resulted in disillusionment when key data could not be reproduced.”</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project in Psychology</a>, which we funded, and which was carried out by our grantee Center for Open Science. That project organized well over 200 psychology labs around the world to systematically redo 100 experiments published in top psychology journals. It found that only about 40% could be reliably replicated (another 40% were inconclusive, and around 20% were decisively <i>not</i> replicated). Since <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">those results were published</a> in 2015, the study has already been cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10200793109432081889&amp;as_sdt=5,44&amp;sciodt=0,44&amp;hl=en">over 4,400 times</a> according to Google Scholar. Many of the most famous results in psychology have turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">unreliable</a> and possibly fraudulent (such as Zimbardo’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford prison experiment</a>), and the best recent treatment of this issue is Stuart Ritchie’s 2020 book “Science Fictions.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper-MacCounPerlmutter2017ch15.pdf">blinding researchers</a> to their own conclusions. The bulk of the reproducibility and publication bias problem seems to be in social science and biomedicine. In many of those fields and subfields – such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160345/">clinical trials in medicine</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1092.pdf">high-throughput bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000090">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661314000540">cognitive science</a>, <a href="https://www.niss.org/publications/deming-data-and-observational-studies-process-out-control-and-needing-fixing">public health and epidemiological research</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12032">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-fault-in-our-stars-%3A-Measuring-and-correcting-Esarey-Wu/48403d5dce1f2972c7a91af3bb2d41635221cb3f">political science</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23696308/">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1019294">education</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124108318973">sociology</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/">computer science</a>, and <a href="https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/">machine learning and AI</a> – the published literature features too many false positives as well as conclusions that may well be p-hacked. It’s enough to make folks at the White House, NIH, and NSF worried about the quality of federally-funded science.</p>
<h2><b>Is science innovative enough?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>At the same time, numerous observers have pointed to an entirely different problem: science has grown less innovative these days. (And even if it hasn’t, we could always benefit from faster innovation.)</p>
<p>In a recent piece, Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, and Michael Nielsen, a theoretical physicist, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">made the case</a> that the rate of scientific advancement is slowing down in recent years per dollar spent. Based on surveys of noted leaders in physics, chemistry, and medicine, they concluded, “Over the past century, we’ve vastly increased the time and money invested in science, but in scientists’ own judgement, we’re producing the most important breakthroughs at a near-constant rate. On a per-dollar or per-person basis, this suggests that science is becoming far less efficient.”</p>
<p>Collison and Nielsen are <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf">far from alone</a>. Cowen and Southwood <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/sites/brown.edu.academics.political-theory-project/files/uploads/Innovation%20%26%20scientific%20progress.pdf">argue</a> that “there is good and also wide-ranging evidence that the rate of scientific progress has indeed slowed down.” The 2019 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">paper</a>, “Are Good Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” argues that in semiconductors, agriculture, and medical innovations, “research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.”	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>They attempted to replicate this analysis for “the internal combustion engine, the speed of air travel, the efficiency of solar panels, the Nordhaus (1997) ‘price of light’ evidence, and the sequencing of the human genome.” But they couldn’t do so because there was no accurate measure of the amount of R&amp;D on those issues.</span>
	 That paper concludes by predicting that “just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty of finding new ideas.”</p>
<p>Of course, some of these assessments might be too <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">pessimistic</a>. But it is depressingly common to hear the world’s most innovative scientists lament that they would never have succeeded in today’s academic or funding system because their work was too outside the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Kornberg (a Nobel-winning biochemist) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">told the Washington Post in 2007</a> that his 1970s research on DNA “would never have gotten the necessary funding” if he had come along in the 2000s: “In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t be funded.”</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/201310090930/cuts-in-federal-funding-hurt-scientific-research">reported</a> in 2013, “UC Berkeley molecular biologist Randy Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine with two other scientists this week. But he says the kind of basic science research that led to his prize might have never gotten funded if he were applying for grants today.”</li>
<li>David Deutsch, who pioneered quantum computing, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/982233180081029128">says</a> that he would never have gotten his “first research grant on quantum computers . . . under today’s criteria.”</li>
<li>Peter Higgs, the Nobel Laureate for whom the Higgs Boson is named, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">believes</a> no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered ‘productive’ enough. . . . ‘Today I wouldn’t get an academic job. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.’”</li>
</ul>
<p>When so many top scientists say that their own work would never have passed muster in the current system, we must take stock of the current system. As prominent scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6441/613">have asked</a>, “How successful would Silicon Valley be if nearly 99% of all investments were awarded to scientists and engineers aged 36 years or older, along with a strong bias toward funding only safe, non-risky projects?” Moreover, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/07/science-holds-key-unlocking-economic-success/">common complaint</a> is that “scientists are forced to specify years in advance what they intend to do, and spend their time continually applying for very short, small grants” – hardly a system that would encourage innovation.</p>
<p>In short, we have evidence that US science funding is often fairly tame and incremental, that some of the most innovative science of the past would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/19/723326933/billion-dollar-gamble-how-a-singular-hero-helped-start-a-new-field-in-physics?fbclid=IwAR28fazRNhzzT5ijMINwzZkNqlP6fEfBlI4OLyY-eesrUyOfbZfF7-P4qUc">never have been funded</a> by today’s bureaucracy, and that scientific review panels are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/492034a">dominated by insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, innovation in science is imperiled. If Einstein had to navigate such a system, we might <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-einstein-get-published-today-11600974323">never have heard of relativity</a>. And even if innovation weren’t slowing down <em>per se</em>, we could still do better.</p>
<h2><b>What next?</b></h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas about how to improve scientific reproducibility in how federal research is funded. After all, quality control and assurance are hardly new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, we could require that data and computer code be shared openly so that others can scrutinize and rerun it. In too many cases to list, this sort of reanalysis has led to revisions, retractions, and even the discovery of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-a-gay-marriage-study-went-wrong">outright fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we could require that experiments and other empirical studies be pre-registered, so that the analysis and results are less likely to be cherry-picked later. We already do this for clinical trials in medicine, and a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382">review</a> of federally-sponsored clinical trials found that the rate of positive results went down dramatically as soon as researchers were required to pre-register their studies. We could do the same for much else in science. We could even move towards more widespread use of the Registered Reports format, in which journals accept an article for publication before the final results are even available.</p>
<p>It’s less obvious how to reform government funding so as to improve scientific <i>innovation</i>. Let’s try a thought experiment:</p>
<p>Imagine that you were the President 100 years ago, instead of Woodrow Wilson. Imagine that a time-traveling genie from the future tells you that over the …</p></div></div></div>

<h4 id="just-not-a-dick-pic-filter">Just Not a Dick Pic Filter</h4>
<h6 id="3-min-read"><em>3 min read</em></h6>
<p>“Go build something,” said the panelist who was clearly more experienced than me.</p>
<p>Boom. These words cut right to me at Nashville’s annual 36-86 Entrepreneur Conference in August 2018. <strong>One month out of the Navy and I had already jumped out of a plane with a bedsheet for a parachute.</strong> My bedsheet was “CrowdCrunch” - clearly a Billion Dollar company even though it hadn’t made a dime. Great name, great website, grand vision, and absolutely no basis in reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://uffizzi.com/images/no-parachute-cropped2.png" alt=""></p>
<h6 id="i-didnt-know-it-at-the-time-but-i-was-deep-into-entrepreneuring"><strong>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was deep into “entrepreneuring”.</strong></h6>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is the stage most people who attempt their own business start in and, for many, never get beyond. Twenty some odd years ago I remember my dad telling me that 19 out of 20 businesses fail and here in 2020 that still seems to be a good round number - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/">about 90% of startups fail</a>.</p>
<p>With all the sexy buzz around accelerators, venture capital, angel investors, and building that network there’s a lot of people out there “entrepreneuring”. And why not? Who doesn’t want to be the next Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or the Zuck himself? Oh and there’s also that “Founder and CEO” title you can immediately put on your business cards.</p>
<h6 id="bonus-points-for-the-ego"><strong>Bonus points for the ego.</strong></h6>
<p>First I’ll define “entrepreneuring” and then it won’t take long to realize why it will get you nowhere over the length of time you spend doing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entrepreneuring">Entrepreneuring</a> according to Dictionary.com is a verb meaning “to deal with or initiate as an entrepreneur” or “to act as an entrepreneur.” Fair enough.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneuring,” however, is something entirely different.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is doing anything and everything but building something. It’s an endless treadmill that sucks most into a cycle of busyness that leads absolutely nowhere.</p>
<h6 id="entrepreneuring-is-about-hoping-the-magic-of-the-entrepreneurial-spirit-somehow-rubs-off-on-you-and-every-door-in-your-future-suddenly-opens-up-based-on-your-enthusiasm-alone"><strong>“Entrepreneuring” is about hoping the magic of the entrepreneurial spirit somehow rubs off on you and every door in your future suddenly opens up based on your enthusiasm alone.</strong></h6>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is about attending lots of conferences, meetups, or any other similar gatherings and hoping to bump into that one person or thing (or probably several people or things) you are missing to make your idea a huge success - if only I knew . . .</p>
<p>It is listening to those who profit off the “entrepreneuring” eco-system spread false enthusiasm about a very loosely associated “Un-valley” start-up movement - as if building a business were a collective effort - which, I can assure you, it decidedly is not.</p>
<h6 id="if-youre-unsure-whether-youre-stuck-entrepreneuring-or-if-youve-moved-to-the-critical-step-of-building-something-its-easier-to-take-notice-of-what-is-not-around"><strong>If you're unsure whether you're stuck “entrepreneuring” or if you've moved to the critical step of “building something” it's easier to take notice of what is not around.</strong></h6>
<p>Specifically, you’re unlikely to see any successful entrepreneurs out “entrepreneuring”. That’s because the people in this category are either 1.) building something that will make them successful or 2.) continuing to build upon that which has already made them successful.</p>
<p>Real entrepreneurs are builders by nature - they build and they test and they fall short and they get back up and above all they keep making everything around them better. All this building requires a lot of time and energy which is exactly why you’re unlikely to see any of these folks out “entrepreneuring.”</p>
<h6 id="to-be-fair-entrepreneuring-is-not-all-bad"><strong>To be fair,</strong> <strong>“entrepreneuring” is not all bad.</strong></h6>
<p>There’s plenty to be learned. You can get nuggets of advice from folks who have been there - I definitely did. You can see what’s not working out for people. You can have your hopes dashed when you learn that VCs don’t actually hand out money for ideas.</p>
<h6 id="but-theres-no-lesson-as-important-as-learning-that-you-need-to-get-out-of-this-phase-as-fast-as-possible"><strong>But there’s no lesson as important as learning that you need to get out of this phase as fast as possible</strong>.</h6>
<p>It sunk in for me at a We Work “entrepreneuring” event where I had struck up a conversation with my table mate. After I had explained the grand vision of CrowdCrunch it was his turn to pitch his business. That’s when I had the distinct privilege of hearing about “an app that uses AI to filter out dick pics”.</p>
<h6 id="now-that-is-one-i-have-not-heard"><strong>Now that is one I have not heard.</strong></h6>
<p><img src="https://uffizzi.com/images/seth-meyers-really-ok.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Are there so many dick Pics flying around that we need an app to filter them out? I’ve seen a lot of flying cocks scribbled on dirty cars in my day, but I was struggling to grasp how this was a problem that needed to be solved. Perhaps the best part of this conversation is when he offered up that the hardest part about building an AI model to filter out dick pics is that, well, man, you have to see a lot of dicks. But I digress.</p>
<h6 id="i-was-entirely-in-the-wrong-place--the-wrong-phase--i-was-out-entrepreneuring-with-mr-dick-pics-himself"><strong>I was entirely in the wrong place - the wrong phase - I was out “entrepreneuring” with Mr. Dick Pics himself.</strong></h6>
<p>So I moved on. I quit attending events with other aspiring entrepreneurs. I turned down meetings with VCs and even turned down an invite to a well-respected veteran pitch contest. I put my head down and I started to build - <strong><em>WE</em></strong> started to build. Thank you Mr. 36-86 panelist - it can’t be said better.</p>
<h6 id="go-build-something1"><strong>Go. Build. Something.</strong></h6>

								<div>
									<ul>
<li><span>Li Jin coined the term, the Passion Economy.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.”&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li</span></li>
<li><span>Are you able to see yourself in your own work? If not, you’re probably not a part of the passion economy. However, it’s not mutually exclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>The creator economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.”&nbsp; — Li</span></li>
<li><span>New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span>Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li</span></li>
<li><span>Li defines community: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest for one another.”&nbsp; — Li</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: </span><i><span>What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Li didn’t call it her north star, but she mentions that she’s more interested in the long-tail of how we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.&nbsp;</span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I am a Computer Science Teaching Fellow at Tufts. Every so often, somebody
comes up to me and expresses some form of the same kind of anxiety,
frustration, worry — whatever you want to call it — centered around one
thing: <em>“Oh gosh. Everyone here knows more than me and they understand things
so quickly and they solve problems so fast.”</em></p>

<p>First, I want to address the comparison to other people. Don’t do that! You are
a different human, a different mass of cells and meat and fluids, with a
different background, a different history, and a different brain.</p>

<p>Second, I want to address the notion that everyone knows more than you. Other
people will be better than you at something. You will be better than other
people at something else. This is normal. This is expected. We all go to school
to learn and become better. Learning to become okay with this feels like a
superpower. I am still working at it.</p>

<p>Third, I want to tell my story.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-not-special">I am not special.</h3>

<p>I am the product of many happy coincidences. I wrote my first line of code when
I was around the age of nine. For some reason, people attribute a lot of
meaning to that, but my interest in programming all comes down to weirdly
specific and lucky combination of factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I did not play videogames, but somehow I wanted to make them</li>
  <li>I had the wherewithal to ask my fourth grade teacher how to make videogames</li>
  <li>He had enough patience to go home and poke around on the internet for a bit
and recommend Scratch</li>
  <li>My dad bought an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">OLPC</a></li>
  <li>The OLPC had a small Python-esque interpreter called <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Pippy">Pippy</a> installed</li>
  <li>I had enough time to sneak down and use the family computer at night when
nobody was monitoring it</li>
  <li>We traveled back to California every once in a while</li>
  <li>Our neighbors in California hired a tutor named Steve<sup id="fnref:jobs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jobs">1</a></sup> to tutor their
son in computer science and math</li>
  <li>Steve was kind enough to sit me down and teach me alongside my neighbor</li>
</ul>

<p>Without any one of those having occurred, I might not have started to write
code in the first place. Which might have been better for my long-term mental
health, because I consistently frustrate myself trying and failing to
understand concepts or complete projects.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-been-confused-for-ages">I have been confused for ages.</h3>

<p><em>What follows is a half-complete log of me trying and failing to understand how
programming works. It spans eleven years and much heartbreak.</em></p>

<p>I started playing with Scratch. I tried to make some games. I did not
understand how boolean logic and loops and time worked, so instead I made some
short animated movies with the block syntax.</p>

<p>I found Pippy, a small and custom Python interpreter for the OLPC, and made
some weird program that told bad jokes. I do not remember the specifics, but I
had at least figured out <code>if</code>-statements and reading input by then. It probably
took me a month to figure out why <code>input</code> would sometimes work and sometimes
give a syntax error. Nobody was around to tell me that <code>raw_input</code> was the way
to go, because <code>input</code> called <code>eval</code> on whatever the user entered. And I would
not have known what <code>eval</code> meant anyway. Nothing much came of my OLPC
programming.</p>

<p>I discovered that the crappy calculators we used for middle school math were
programmable in an obscure language called TI Basic. I heard they could be
programmed on the computer and then that program transferred to the calculator.
But we did not have the cables, so instead I spent many math classes trying to
type full programs on the little keyboard. I wrote some helper functions that
did some trigonometry problems for me. I did not understand what I was doing,
though, or how variables worked, so whenever I wanted to write a new program I
would have to go through the manual again and try and discover anew how TI
Basic worked.</p>

<p>I remembered Pippy and tried in vain to find a Pippy interpreter for Windows
XP. Alas, nobody wrote such a thing — of course — but I somehow stumbled
upon Python and fumbled my way through a Python/IDLE installation. I wrote a
math module that did more of my math homework for me. But my attempts to do
anything remotely beyond that scope were foiled. And my math teacher found out
about the module because my homework had all these unnecessary steps in them,
and my program was not smart enough to remove them. So I got in trouble.</p>

<p>At some point in here I discovered JavaScript and spent a couple days writing
small interactive websites. In order to do some kinds of logic, the internet
recommended writing code in PHP. So I spent several weeks not understanding the
difference between client-side and server-side applications, trying to embed
PHP in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. I eventually gave up. I only grasped the difference
years later.</p>

<p>Steve, the tutor from some time ago, tried to teach me something about
programming on a semi-regular basis. He used <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> as a text resource and had
me learn both in C and in Scheme. I could repeat what he did, but I could not
come up with the solutions to these problems on my own. I got really frustrated
because I could not understand what the heck <em>recursion</em> was and why it was so
important that a function could call itself.</p>

<p>In one of my English classes in high school, there was a time when the class
was sent to the computer lab to write an essay. A friend of mine was writing
something that was decidedly <em>not</em> an English essay, so I inquired further. It
turns out that he was writing a Python program to trade Bitcoin.<sup id="fnref:bitcoin" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bitcoin">2</a></sup> He
agreed to (re-)teach me the basics of Python, because I remembered
next-to-nothing. I wrote some bad code and called it a day.</p>

<p>I joined the robotics team because my aforementioned neighbor was on it and he
was the programming captain. He was the only programmer on the team and I
wanted to be of service. At this point in his career, at the age of 15, he had
already written a fully-functional parser, compiler, and virtual machine <em>in
C</em>. Because I was functionally useless and also wanted to learn how to make my
own programming language, he sent me away several times with exercises like
“write a simple stack-based math language”.<sup id="fnref:rpncalc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rpncalc">3</a></sup> I coded myself in circles
and did not grasp how the program was supposed to maintain state or even
properly read in input.</p>

<p>I took the AP Computer Science class that my high school offered. The exercises
were generally reasonably trivial and they were partner exercises. The hardest
one for me and my partner was implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm. We did not
figure it out in time and submitted a half-baked and broken solution. To this
day, I cannot recall how exactly it works without referencing some external
source.</p>

<p>Sometime during high school, I got so frustrated that I came nowhere close to
understanding programming at the level that my neighbor did. I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6887471/569183">turned to the
internet</a> for help. Some kind soul named Charles<sup id="fnref:charles" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:charles">4</a></sup> took
the time to write a long, well-thought-out response. I did not really
understand what he meant at first, but after a month or two of goofing off when
I should have been working at my summer job, something clicked and I wrote a
small program that accomplished part of his suggested task. It was not
Turing-complete, but it <em>worked</em>.</p>

<p>Another English class came along. In this one, my teacher had an idea of “20%
projects”, the kind that Google encourages. One day a week, we got to work on
projects of our choosing — so long as we wrote them up for the end of the
semester. I chose to re-write my crappy “programming language” as an actual
virtual machine, because I still did not understand how on Earth those were
supposed to work. I had a half-working implementation by the end of the
semester, and continued poking at it throughout my freshman year in college. I
was fortunate enough to have a mentor — my robotics coach — when everything
frequently went to hell and broke. He was there primarily for moral support and
occasionally to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>There is too much frustration in college to post it all here. It would sound
repetitive. But I struggled in COMP 15. I struggled in COMP 40. In Web
Engineering — I think I pissed off everybody I worked with in my group. I
struggled in Operating Systems. In COMP 160. In COMP 170. I <em>still</em> do not know
what happened in Graphics (sorry, Jason!). Or the Security Capture the Flag,
for that matter (sorry, everyone on my team!). I struggled in COMP 105. In
Networks. I struggled as a TA. I only figured out how the heap data structure
was supposed to work when I got up to lead a lab about it and someone asked a
particularly tricky question. I answered student questions wrong. I told them
too much. Too little. Did not know how to teach. Did not know how to manage my
own time.</p>

<h3 id="i-will-continue-to-be-confused">I will continue to be confused.</h3>

<p>Even now, I am bashing my head against the wall trying to figure out how I want
to represent my data for the compiler I am working on. Some people react
strongly to this — “Max, but you at least understand compilers! You did XYZ
thing!”. Sometimes, sometimes not. It does not <em>feel</em> like I understand what is
going on. After years of trying and taking three separate classes about
interpreters and compilers, I have not written a functioning compiler. And this
occasionally scares me because I am supposed to work on compilers full-time
next year.</p>

<h3 id="its-okay">It’s okay.</h3>

<p>I spoke to somebody at Google who studied compilers in undergrad and got a
Master’s degree in compilers. He confessed to me that he too has not written a
compiler and sometimes worries about this. This helped me realize: I am not the
only one who feels like a fraud!</p>

<p>I spoke to my friend and co-TA Margaret, who reframed my thinking. She
explained that it is important to think in terms of <em>deltas</em>. That I should
look back over the past years and realize how much I have learned and
accomplished in that time. A year ago, where was I? I was writing a blog series
about interpreters because <em>I did not know how they worked and needed to
learn</em>. And through writing about it I — over the course of half a year —
finally figured out how the heck Lisp worked.<sup id="fnref:macros" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:macros">5</a></sup></p>

<p>There are so many wonderfully talented people who I know and admire. They</p></div></div>

<h3>When it comes to building apps in JavaScript, my go-to frameworks are Vue and React. They have their similarities, but also a bit of differences when it comes to writing code, so let’s explore some of them. </h3>
<p>This article is a continuation of my previous article about my journey to<a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/my-journey-to-mastering-react/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mastering React</a>. I thought it would be a good idea to make a comparison between Vue and React, but in a more specific way. Rather than analyzing the high-level differences, we’ll be taking a look at the code and the overall development experience in both technologies.</p>
<p>For this article, I decided to create the same, although a rather simple, application in Vue and React. My reasoning behind this is that I haven’t found that many examples of a comparison made on a simpler application. And it made no sense to recreate a larger application twice, especially since a <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great example</a> already exists.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Here is an example of a screen you might see in the application. The search bar is connected to the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PokeAPI</a> and it allows you to search for Pokemon by their name or ID. After you’ve searched for a Pokemon, you can see its stats and also add it to a list of your favourite Pokemon. Afterwards, you can remove a Pokemon from the said list.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="600" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-768x360.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>The project I made represents a more realistic scenario where I’ve used a <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UI library</a> and made some simple <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API requests</a>, much like you would do in a real project. This way, I was offered a much broader palette of functionalities to showcase. I have also used Typescript to mimic the workflow in Bornfight.</p>
<p>Both projects were set up in the same way, so we could clearly see the differences without worrying about different implementations between the libraries. The <a href="https://github.com/ShockwaVee/vue-react-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s repository</a> is located on Github, so you can check it out for yourself if you’d like. I’ve also tried to name all of the variables and components the same, but some inconsistencies might creep up. It might be a good idea to mention that a lot of the conclusions will be my own opinions which might differ from yours. <strong>I urge you to do something similar by yourself because it’s really interesting to dissect an idea this way!</strong></p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>The setup went on pretty much without any difference between the two, although Vue’s CLI made it a bit neater. The only thing that had to be installed additionally for React was <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">node-sass</a> to allow me to use SASS inside the project, but that’s about it. I’d also note that I used Vue 2 instead of Vue 3, even though Vue 3 and current React might be a bit more similar.</p>
<p><strong>This was the Vue setup with the CLI:</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p><strong>And this was the same process for React:</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="250" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-768x150.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>I’ve additionally installed axios and the Ant Design implementation for each.</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>The structure, in the end, was pretty much the same. I did make a few more folders for the React application because they also hold the .scss files.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>On the left is the React app (just the /src). As you can see most of it is the same as the Vue app, save for some default stuff generated by each app, ie. typings and .env. The only larger difference is that I made the interfaces folders for each component for React since they also hold the prop types.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The next logical step to this would be to check out the code, so we’re going to do just that. I’ll try to follow the hierarchy of the app to make the comparisons. The App components are pretty much the same, so we’re gonna jump straight in the Search components.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, the state management is completely different in Vue 2 and React.</strong></p>
<pre>const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
const [currentPokemon, setCurrentPokemon] = useState(null);
const [favouritePokemon, setFavouritePokemon] = useState(new Set&lt;Pokemon&gt;());</pre>
<pre>data() {
&nbsp;return {
&nbsp; &nbsp;currentPokemon: null,
&nbsp; &nbsp;favouritePokemon: []
&nbsp;};
}</pre>
<p>We do have an additional property (query) on the React side, as well as a much more suitable data type for our list of favorite Pokemon. From here on out, we’ll see that React has a bit of a better symbiosis with Typescript. Declaring prop and data types was much easier in React than in Vue. <strong>But I should mention that these issues are mostly fixed with Vue 3!</strong></p>
<p>Alongside our list of favourite Pokemon, we also have our currently searched Pokemon object, as well as our search query. The initial value of our current Pokemon is null, so to change that we must fetch it from our API.</p>
<p><strong>In React, we’ll use the useCallback function to do that.</strong></p>
<pre>const fetchPokemon = useCallback(async () =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp; &nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = await axios(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${query}`);
&nbsp; &nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;notification.error({
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;message: "Pokemon doesn't exist",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: "A Pokemon by this ID or name does not exist."
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;});
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return;
&nbsp; &nbsp;}

&nbsp; &nbsp;setCurrentPokemon(pokemon.data);

}, [query]);

const searchPokemonByIdOrName = (idOrName: string) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;setQuery(idOrName);
}

useEffect(() =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;if (query !== "") {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetchPokemon();
&nbsp; &nbsp;}
}, [fetchPokemon, query]);</pre>
<p>It’s nothing that spectacular, to be honest. We use axios to get the data, so if the request is successful, we set the data with <strong>setCurrentPokemon()</strong> function and pass the Pokemon object. If you’re not familiar with this procedure, I recommend reading about it in the React docs. If it’s not successful, an error message is displayed to the user using the Ant Design’s notification system.</p>
<p>As you can see, the query is listed in the dependency array. That way React knows which data must be tracked to check for changes. We must also use <strong>useEffect</strong> to trigger fetching Pokemon. <strong>useEffect</strong> does not support async functions, but we can call async functions inside it. So, every time a query (or <strong>fetchPokemon</strong>) changes, <strong>fetchPokemon</strong> is called. To make it all work, we use the <strong>searchPokemonByIdOrName()</strong> to simply change the query and trigger everything else.</p>
<p><strong>The same thing in Vue looks something like this.</strong></p>
<pre>async searchPokemonByIdOrName(searchQuery: string | number) {
&nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = await PokeService.findPokemonByIdOrName(searchQuery);
&nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp;this.$notification.error({
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;message: "Pokemon doesn't exist",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: "A Pokemon by this ID or name does not exist."
&nbsp; &nbsp;});
&nbsp; &nbsp;return;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;this.currentPokemon = pokemon;
}</pre>
<p>The functionality is basically the same, although I have extracted the API call in a separate class to prevent polluting the component. In hindsight, this probably wasn’t necessary and would work the same as in the React app.</p>
<p><strong>Just for reference, I’ll show you the PokeService class so you can see no funny business is happening inside.</strong></p>
<pre>export class PokeService {
&nbsp;static async findPokemonByIdOrName(idOrName: string | number) {
&nbsp; &nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp; &nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = (await Vue.axios.get(`/pokemon/${idOrName}`)) as AxiosResponse;
&nbsp; &nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return Promise.reject(e);
&nbsp; &nbsp;}

&nbsp; &nbsp;return Promise.resolve(pokemon.data);
&nbsp;}
}</pre>
<p>Hopping back to our component, the whole process is much simpler in Vue. We can just assign the Pokemon object to our data property and Vue handles the rest for us. To be fair, I handled the Vue part in a bit more declarative way, so the amount of code is smaller in Vue. <strong>Vue does a lot more for us under the hood than React. This is great for the majority of the cases, but sometimes we need the low-level control React offers us.</strong></p>
<p>Adding and removing favorites is pretty straightforward, but there are some conversions happening to the array when filtering. That is because filtering isn’t supported on a set. </p>
<p><strong>You can see this in the code for React.</strong></p>
<pre>const addToFavourites = (pokemon: Pokemon) &nbsp;=&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;setFavouritePokemon(new Set&lt;Pokemon&gt;([...Array.from(favouritePokemon), pokemon]))
}

const removeFromFavourites = (id: number) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;const filteredFavouritePokemon = Array.from(favouritePokemon).filter((pokemon: Pokemon) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return pokemon.id !== id;
&nbsp; &nbsp;})
&nbsp; &nbsp;setFavouritePokemon(new Set(filteredFavouritePokemon));
}</pre>
<p>In Vue, functions are named a bit differently, but they do the same thing. They do it in a different way because <strong>favouritePokemon</strong> in Vue is declared as an array, instead of a set. Other than this, I’d say this part is pretty much the same since it represents our business logic.</p>
<pre>onAddToFavourites(pokemon: Pokemon) {
&nbsp;const pokemonSet: Set&lt;Pokemon&gt; = new Set(this.favouritePokemon);
&nbsp;pokemonSet.add(pokemon);
&nbsp;this.favouritePokemon = Array.from(pokemonSet);
},
onRemoveFromFavourites(id: number) {
&nbsp;this.favouritePokemon = this.favouritePokemon.filter(
&nbsp; &nbsp;(pokemon: Pokemon) =&gt; pokemon.id !== id
&nbsp;);
}</pre>
<p>I used a set in both cases to prevent the user from having the same favourite Pokemon multiple times.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to take a look at the templates of these components. </p>
<p><strong>The first one is for React.</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;div&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;SearchBar onSearch={searchPokemonByIdOrName} /&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div className={styles.wrapper}&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonDetails pokemon={currentPokemon} addFavouritePokemon={addToFavourites}/&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonList favouritePokemon={favouritePokemon} removeFavourite={removeFromFavourites}/&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>And the other one is for Vue.</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;template&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;SearchBar :on-search="searchPokemonByIdOrName"&gt;&lt;/SearchBar&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonDetails
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:pokemon="currentPokemon"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@add-to-favourites="onAddToFavourites"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&lt;/PokemonDetails&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonList
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:favourite-pokemon="favouritePokemon"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@remove-favourite="onRemoveFromFavourites"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&lt;/PokemonList&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</pre>
<p>As you can see, there isn’t much difference between the two. It’s a bit of a different syntax for passing down props, but other than that it’s kind of the same.</p>
<p>There is this weird <strong>@</strong> symbol dotted around in the Vue template. I will explain this in a bit, but this is the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two-way component communication in Vue</a>, between a parent and a child component. We can send props down to the child, but the child can inform the parent about some changes using events. <strong>React doesn’t have its own version of events since it promotes a unidirectional data flow between components.</strong></p>
<p>I will briefly show you the other …</p></div></div></section></div>

          <p><strong>One of the most frequent questions I'm asked is </strong><em>how </em>I got these results and <em>how </em>I make the show sound so good.</p><p>I put a <em>ton </em>of work into Creative Elements. I'm very proud of it. My goal is to create a show that sounds as good as something on NPR or Gimlet.</p><p>But...I'm just one guy. I don't have the skills or resources that those big shows have. <strong>So I've learned to adapt and do the best that I can with what I have.</strong> I don't spend a ton of money on production, but the show sounds really, really good.</p>

          <p>For every episode of my show, I'm concerned with telling a good story. Good stories have a narrative arch, every bit of the story is purposeful, and it is engaging.</p><p>Most interviews don't sound like that out-of-the-box. So I spend a lot of time reorganizing, cutting, scripting, recording voiceover, and pulling in external audio.</p><p>In this course, I walk you through how I think about those creative decisions and how I do it all in ~5 hours of work.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Business performance improves when technologists are empowered, when they have the right environment, and when points of friction are removed. </p></blockquote>
<p>Early in David Theriault’s career as a developer, he was called to attend a meeting with management, in which the bosses discussed how to fill developers’ time. Managers proceeded to allocate the developers’ full schedules in 15-minute blocks for over a week out, Theriault recalls.</p>
<p>In other words, the managers predetermined how much time projects should take without any room for possible overages, Theriault says. Then, the managers got into a discussion about what they should do with the developers’ remaining time – literally 15 minutes at the end of the week.</p>
<p>“It was demeaning to think you’re basically punching in and out and there was no room for anything creative or any training,’’ Theriault says.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there. The managers also assigned each developer to a group with QA, product, and design people. In effect they created silos, instead of allowing for dialogue and relationship building across teams “so they don’t feel so isolated and stagnant,’’ Theriault says. “At the time, I was a junior developer and I thought, ‘I won’t make much forward progress here.’” Ultimately, he left.</p>
<p>Today, Theriault is a manager in the analytics division at <a href="https://www.tracelink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TraceLink</a>, which specializes in pharmaceutical&nbsp;supply chain management. Fortunately, he no longer has to deal with the factory-like approach to software development.</p>
<p>You’d think organizations would have mastered how to develop software effectively by now. Yet, while many have invested in software development, those investments have not led to meaningful performance improvements, according to a report from McKinsey.</p>
<p>“Leaders still struggle to scale promising sandbox innovations, the firm <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in April. “We often hear CEOs, chief technology officers, and chief information officers lament that their software development spending is a ‘black box.’”</p>
<h3>Thinking outside the black box</h3>
<p>It doesn’t need to be that dire. Business performance through software development improves when developers are empowered and they have the right environment in which to innovate, and points of friction are removed, according to McKinsey.</p>
<p>Developers, not surprisingly, agree wholeheartedly. They say they thrive when they are trusted and allowed to do their work autonomously.</p>
<p>“The single thing that defines developer empowerment for me is being able to code fearlessly,’’ says Ben Boyter, technical lead for <a href="https://www.kablamo.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kablamo</a>, a cloud&nbsp;services provider in Sydney, Australia. “You need to be able to make any change you want to the system as a whole, small or large, with such a low cost for failure that you are no longer afraid to try things.”</p>
<p>A developer should be checking code, knowing that they can revert mistakes they made, says Boyter, who wrote a <a href="https://boyter.org/posts/developer-empowerment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> about developer empowerment in 2019. Development teams should also deploy code with the understanding that they can roll it back&nbsp;if it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>“They should be confident that once they check their code … <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-rules-for-successful-test-automation/">the system it supports should be tested in an automated way</a>, so even if they make a simple mistake it will be picked up,’’ Boyter adds. “Or that even if not, monitoring systems will give an idea that something has changed, and maybe even tell you what system it affects.”</p>
<p>Yet, Boyter believes&nbsp;that companies don’t allow for this because they are afraid of failure, and don’t accept is that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-recognize-the-warning-signs-of-a-project-crisis/">failure is normal and part of the process</a>. “Nobody is perfect, no amount of testing is going to catch every bug, no code is perfect, and even formal proofs are only as good as their requirements,” he notes.</p>
<p>When companies learn to accept that software development is iterative, and build failure into the development equation, “You can own it,” says Boyter. “Once you own failure, you can then control it and make it work for you. Suddenly,&nbsp;large sweeping changes are no longer scary.”</p>
<p>The end result? Developers can code fearlessly, Boyter says. “And as such, they will feel empowered.”</p>
<h3>Start with trust</h3>
<p>Being an empowered developer means that you are trusted to get the work done and your time is respected, agrees Greg Reed, co-founder and technical director of digital product agency&nbsp;<a href="https://thisissoon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOON</a>, based in London.</p>
<p>When a developer is empowered, “People in the organization listen to you and actively seek your advice,’’ Reed says.&nbsp;“You’re allowed to say no. In fact, you’re <em>expected</em> to say no, and you’re trusted to make good decisions.&nbsp;You’re given the space to explore and research new technologies and time to refactor and improve old ones.”</p>
<p>Ariel Illouz, senior software engineer at software development company <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinearB</a> in Israel, says he’s not only a empowered developer, but he empower his team as well. For example, LinearB establishes areas of responsibility (AORs), such as customer success and cloud infrastructure cost. He and every developer on his team has their own AOR. Each developer manages their AOR and reports on it weekly, Illouz says. “This level of responsibility and trust is empowering for individual developers.”</p>
<h3><strong>Give people the freedom to resolve issues</strong></h3>
<p>Today’s developers and testers are responsible for bigger codebases spanning more languages and technologies than ever before, notes Theriault. And since they are in the code day-in and day out, they’re the only people who know if there’s a component that won’t scale, or a security vulnerability, or any one of a hundred other issues.</p>
<p>If the developers don’t raise the issue, no one else is likely to until it’s too late – until it’s affecting customers, Theriault says.&nbsp;“Empowered developers are the <em>only </em>ones who can solve these problems.”</p>
<p>Further, organizations have to acknowledge that issues are not just a software development problem, observes Reed.&nbsp;“The organization and all the stakeholders have to be committed to a process of prioritization, iteration, and improvement.&nbsp;As teams, we’ve invented all these buzzwords – agile, user research, user experience, minimum viable product – in order to focus effort and build confidence that what we’re developing will lead to meaningful performance improvements.”</p>
<p>There has to be space to implement and refine these processes to get the results, Reed says.</p>
<p>Illouz sees two main issues organizations have with software development: losing things that fall between the cracks and innovation.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re a startup with limited resources or a new hybrid remote team, things get forgotten about, priorities change, and bugs come up,’’ Illouz says. “By giving my team members direct areas of responsibility without much oversight, they take ownership and fewer issues are forgotten about.”</p>
<p>Take time for a retrospective at the end of each sprint and listen to developers. If managers don’t do this, they lose out on a lot of value, Illouz says.</p>
<p>“We then test the idea to see if it works. If someone fails at being better, that’s not a bad thing. Fail fast, learn from it, and keep moving forward,’’ Illouz says. “But you always have to provide an environment based on trust.”</p>
<h3>How to become an empowered developer</h3>
<p>Empowered developers are creative,&nbsp;they tinker, and they find clever solutions, says Theriault.&nbsp;They are proactive. They identify and solve issues before they reach the customer.</p>
<p>The ability to become one starts with the organization adopting an open mindset, techies say.</p>
<p>“It’s tough, but you’ve got to learn to say no,’’ says Reed. “Start having those difficult conversations with your project managers and stakeholders.&nbsp;You have to be honest about how long things take, and you have to raise the alarm when you know it can’t be done.”</p>
<p>That way, scope can be reduced, things are appropriately prioritized, and the software team members can focus their efforts on the things that produce the best possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Developers and testers also have to take responsibility. If the codebase is poor, or they inherited a restrictive system, or there’s a culture of writing bad code because there’s no time to do it any other way – they have to fix it.&nbsp;“Clean it up, build in time to refactor, create tests, and make it yours,’’ Reed says.</p>
<p>Also, “Ask yourself, do you have confidence in what you are making? What problem are you trying to solve and does the solution make sense?”&nbsp;If it doesn’t, you have to give your input and start a discussion. You should feel confident that what you’re developing is going to have an impact, Reed says.</p>
<p>But, Reed adds, “If you try all these things and your company still doesn’t take you seriously, then I’m afraid it’s time to leave.”</p>
<p>Theriault echoes that sentiment. “If developers see that their warnings fall on deaf ears then they will simply stop raising the alarm.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">Leaders need to listen</a>.&nbsp;I tell my team I want us to build software that we’re all proud of.”</p>
<p>Since developers know where the weak points&nbsp;are, Theriault says, “I need them to raise the issue, file the bug and in return, my pledge to them is that action will be taken, we will schedule the fixes and at every iteration, we will get stronger.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>TL;DR check out the <a href="#color-functions">Color Functions</a> below.</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> is to get access to its <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color">color functions</a> like <code>lighten</code>, <code>darken</code>, and <code>transparentize</code>. These functions are useful because allow defining a color once, then dynamically generating variants of that color for different uses.</p>
<p>For example, here's an <code>alert</code> component that needs three shades of blue.</p>
<p data-height="150" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="gschier" data-slug-hash="VwjYazv" data-pen-title="VwjYazv">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/VwjYazv">
  yLJajep</a> by Gregory Schier (<a href="https://codepen.io/gschier">@gschier</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<p>With the help of the <code>transparentize</code> and <code>darken</code> SASS functions we can generate the color variants needed for the light background and dark text.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>$color: #4299E1; // Blue

.alert {  
  // Subtle tinted background
  background-color: transparentize($color, 0.9);

  // Colored border
  border: 1px solid $color;

  // Color text, darkened for good contrast
  color: darken($color, 20%);
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>But, what if you can't use a preprocessor? Well, you're in luck! CSS doesn't include built-in color functions, but <strong>this post demonstrates how to combine <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties (variables)</a> with the <code>hsl</code> color model to achieve the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>To implement these color manipulations, we need to think outside the box. Here's the general strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break colors into three variables: hue, saturation, and lightness</li>
<li>Combine HSL variables with <code>hsl(360, 100%, 100%)</code> color syntax</li>
<li>Use the CSS <code>calc</code> function to manipulate HSL variables</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the previous <code>alert</code> component implemented using our vanilly-CSS strategy.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>:root {
  --color-h: 207; /* Hue        */
  --color-s: 73%; /* Saturation */
  --color-l: 57%; /* Lightness  */
}

.alert {
  /* Colored border */
  border: 2px solid hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    var(--color-l)
  );

  /* Subtle tinted background */
  background-color: hsla(
    var(--color-h),
    var(--color-s),
    var(--color-l),
    0.1
  );

  /* Color text, darkened for good contrast */
  color: hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    calc(var(--color-l) * 0.7)
  );
}

/*
 * BONUS!
 * 
 * CSS variables are scoped, so can easily be changed
 * based on a given class.
 *
 * In SASS, this would actually be MORE difficult, requiring
 * use of mixins.
 */
.alert.danger {
  --color-h: 0; /* Change hue to red */
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>The resulting output is the exact same as the SASS example, except we didn't need a preprocessor to do it! 🤯</p>
<p data-height="207" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="gschier" data-slug-hash="yLJajep" data-pen-title="yLJajep">

<h2 id="color-functions" tabindex="0">Color Functions<a href="#color-functions">#</a></h2>
<p>The first example in this post demonstrated how to darkening a color and adding transparency, but there's a lot more that can be done too. Here are the most useful examples.</p>
<h3 id="shift-hue" tabindex="0">Shift Hue<a href="#shift-hue">#</a></h3>
<p>The hue can be rotated by adding a value, in degrees, to the hue variable. Note, hue ranges from 0-360 degrees but will still work if it's exceeded (ie. <code>30</code> is the same hue as <code>30 + 360 = 390</code>)</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  calc(var(--color-h) + 80),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="transparentize-alpha" tabindex="0">Transparentize (Alpha)<a href="#transparentize-alpha">#</a></h3>
<p>Transparency can be set using <code>hsla</code> to specify the desired alpha value.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsla(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l),
  0.5 /* specify alpha channel */
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="adjust-lightness" tabindex="0">Adjust Lightness<a href="#adjust-lightness">#</a></h3>
<p>Lightness can be adjusted by multiplying by a value greater than <code>0</code>. Values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will darken, while values greater than <code>1</code> will lighten.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 &lt; n &lt; 1 darkens, n &gt; 1 lightens */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  calc(var(--color-l) * 0.4)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="darken-to-black" tabindex="0">Darken to Black<a href="#darken-to-black">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>lightness - (lightness * v)</code> to essentially mix a color with black. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be black.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (black) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  calc(var(--color-l) - var(--color-l) * 0.3)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="lighten-to-white" tabindex="0">Lighten to White<a href="#lighten-to-white">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula that uses <code>lightness + (100% - lightness) * v</code> to essentially mix a color with white. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be white.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (white) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  calc(var(--color-l) + (100% - var(--color-l)) * 0.4)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="adjust-saturation" tabindex="0">Adjust Saturation<a href="#adjust-saturation">#</a></h3>
<p>Saturation can be adjusted by multiplying by a value greater than <code>0</code>. Values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will decrease saturation, while values greater than <code>1</code> will increate saturation.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  calc(var(--color-s) * 0.6),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="saturate" tabindex="0">Saturate<a href="#saturate">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>saturation + (100% - saturation) * v</code> to increase saturation from the current saturation to full. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be 100% saturated.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (full) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  calc(var(--color-s) + (100% - var(--color-s)) * 0.9),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="desaturate" tabindex="0">Desaturate<a href="#desaturate">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>saturation - (saturation * v)</code> to decrease saturation from the current saturation to grayscale. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be entirely grayscale.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (grayscale) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  calc(var(--color-s) - var(--color-s) * 0.6),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="grayscale" tabindex="0">Grayscale<a href="#grayscale">#</a></h3>
<p>A color can be converted to grayscale by setting the saturation component to <code>0%</code>.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  0%, /* Remove saturation component */
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="complement" tabindex="0">Complement<a href="#complement">#</a></h3>
<p>The compliment of a color can be calculated by rotating the hue 180 degrees.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  calc(var(--color-h) + 180),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="invert-bonus" tabindex="0">Invert (BONUS)<a href="#invert-bonus">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the only SASS color function we cannot using the HSL model. But, if you really need to calculate a color's inverse, we can define additional RGB variables for our color and use them to calculate the inverse.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>:root {
  --color-r: 65;
  --color-g: 153;
  --color-b: 225;
}

rgb(
  calc(255 - var(--color-r)),
  calc(255 - var(--color-g)),
  calc(255 - var(--color-b))
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="why-do-this" tabindex="0">Why Do This?<a href="#why-do-this">#</a></h2>
<p>We've just seen how vanilla CSS can be used to manipulate colors but <strong>why wouldn't we just use a preprocessor?</strong> Well, even though CSS is more verbose, there <em>are</em> some benefits.</p>
<p><strong>1) Dynamic theming:</strong><br>
The largest benefit of CSS variables variables is the ability to change them at runtime using JavaScript<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This makes adding dark mode or user-customizable themes trivial, for example. In fact, <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> relies heavily on CSS variables for it's theme system.</p>
<p><strong>2) Scoped variables:</strong><br> 
We saw in the previous example how we generated a red alert by simply changing the hue variable within the <code>.alert.danger</code> selector. This is because CSS variables are scoped. Since SASS does not support scoping like this, we'd have to add complexity by using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">mixins</a> instead.</p>
<p><strong>3) Preprocessors are a pain:</strong><br>
Not having to setup a preprocessor like SASS can be a huge benefit for simple projects and beginners. There are also some projects where a preprocessing step won't be an option at all.</p>
<p>So, with a little creative thinking, we were able to implement all off SASS's color manipulation functions using CSS variables and <code>calc()</code>. Perhaps one day CSS will have these functions build in but, until then, this will suffice.</p>

<h2>Trump sends on average 10-12 emails a day</h2>
<p>Here's a look at the emails his team sent in one day:
<img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-how-many-emails-a-day.png" alt="Trump sends 10-12 emails a day on average">
</p><h2>Trump uses several different sender names for his emails</h2>
<p>Trump’s team uses different senders names for his emails including:
</p><p>Official Trump Campaign Store
<br>Donald J. Trump
<br>Trump 1000 Club
<br>Donald Trump Jr.
<br>Eric Trump
<br>Official Trump Polling
<br>Trump Match Alert
<br>Mike Pence
</p><p>
Different sender names lets them resend similar offers and messages with a fresh approach. For example, they often offer a 800% donation match in their emails and one of them came from Donald Trump Jr. saying:
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Nothing can keep my father down.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-sender-name.png" alt="Trump uses different sender names for his emails">
</p></div>
<h2>Subject lines are often short and punchy; the longest ones are only 8-9 words.</h2>
<p>Interesting subject lines:
</p><p>(1) UNOPENED MESSAGE
<br>You + Me in LA
<br>You’re going to love this.
</p><h2>Psychological tactics that Trump's emails use often</h2>
<h5>Match incentives</h5>
<p>Trump’s emails often offer a 800% match for donations to give supporters the feeling making even a small contribution would make a difference. These emails have buttons with different donation amounts and their total amount after the 800% match.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>800%-MATCH
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching incentive">
</p></div>
<p>Using different approaches, Trump’s team sends the most emails about his offer to match donations.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>📎 Matching Check Attached
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-2.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching check">
</p></div>
<h5>Exclusivity</h5>
<p>In some emails, Trump taps into people’s desire to feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves. They position donating to the campaign as joining an exclusive club and elevate its prestige by offering a personalized membership card.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Become a Platinum Member
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-personalized-membership-card.png" alt="Trump email donate to join exclusive club">
</p></div>
<p>The Trump team sends different versions of this approach so they feel like fresh offers.
</p><p>Here’s one from Kimberly Guilfoyle, an advisor to Donald Trump, inviting you to join the exclusive Trump 100 Club.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>You’re going to love this.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-100-club.png" alt="Trump email donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Ego boost</h5>
<p>A handful of Trump’s emails try to make you feel special and give you the opportunity to stand out as a highly valued supporter.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>I want to do something special for you
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-ego-boost.png" alt="Trump emails donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Win something</h5>
<p>A few of Trump’s emails offer you the chance to win a trip to meet him if you make a donation. Beyond having your travel expenses covered, they tap into your desire to meet someone important.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>🌞 Sunny LA 🌞
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-win-trip-to-la.png" alt="Win a trip to LA to meet Trump">
</p></div>
<h5>Guilt</h5>
<p>Some of Trump’s emails encourage you to donate by creating the feeling that he’s really counting on you and you’d be letting him down if you don't.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Contribution Status: MISSING
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-3.png" alt="Trump's matching incentive: don't let him down">
</p></div>
<p>This email explicitly says Trump would be disappointed if you did not donate, with a picture of him looking sternly at you.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>President Trump is calling on his top supporters
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-900-matching-incentive.png" alt="Trump would be disappointed if you didn't donate">

October 21, 2020 | https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Insurance tech is having its moment. Startups in the space received <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-startups-investor-quality-q2-q3-2020">$33b of funding</a> in 2019, the largest amount in the industry’s short history. As we head into the last quarter of 2020, we’re seeking to better understand where insurtech startups are filling traditional insurance market gaps.</p><p>Insurance products compete on two axes: customer experience and underwriting accuracy. Over the past half-decade, insurtech startups have used machine learning and data collection capabilities to hit on both of these axes, catering to digital, transparent, on-demand consumer preferences. Customers can now manage the entire insurance experience online — from policy shopping to claims settlement — with lower premiums than traditional insurers.&nbsp;</p><p>                                                       <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/app/insurance_now">The full Radar can be found <strong>here</strong>.</a></p><p>To dig into the startups in this area, we turned to our <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/products/radar">Radar</a> product, <em>a market map on steroids</em> that adds context to sectors and helps identify startups filling market gaps. In this Radar, we identified 20 sectors filling 3 primary market gaps: a product experience gap, an insurance product gap, and an underwriting gap. This piece briefly walks through each gap with example startups in each category.</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/radiclewebsite/502a4c68-a736-436e-b36d-12e80f6dd6ba_Screen+Shot+2020-09-14+at+2.34.51+PM.png?auto=compress,format" alt=""></p><p><strong>Product Experience Gap</strong></p><p>The product experience gap fills in a key hole where legacy insurers have traditionally failed: customer experience. New-age, digital solutions are providing transparent policies, immediate claim fulfillment, and active customer support. Solutions addressing this gap sit across the entire spectrum of insurance products. Example sectors include Auto Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://clearcover.com/">Clearcover</a>), Travel Insurance Providers (<a href="https://pluto.travel/cover">Pluto</a>), and Homeowners Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://www.hippo.com/">Hippo</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Take Clearcover as an example. Clearcover offers simple, online-only auto insurance with an improved customer experience. Through the company's app, policyholders can instantly file claims (which are paid within a few days), manage bill payments, and provide proof of insurance without the need for a wifi connection or cell service. Additionally, Clearcover's policies include "alternate transport coverage," a more flexible repair stipend compared to traditional insurer's rental car coverage. With alternate transport coverage, Clearcover customers can spend their stipend on public transportation, rental car coverage, and ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft.</p><p>Or consider Pluto, a travel insurance provider. Pluto addresses the opaque and bureaucratic qualities of the travel insurance industry by making policies easy to understand. Through Pluto's smartphone app, customers can evaluate and purchase jargon-free coverage options, receive access to medical assistance, and submit claims for events like flight delays in 10 minutes or less.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insurance Product Gap</strong></p><p>The insurance product gap addresses cohorts that previously had little or no coverage. This encompasses solutions like Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers (<a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a>), Ridesharing Insurance (<a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a>), and Drone Insurance Digital Brokers (<a href="https://www.thimble.com/verifly-drone-insurance">Thimble</a>).</p><p>One start-up addressing the insurance product gap is <a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a> (Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers), a home insurance provider for rental hosts. Since standard homeowner’s insurance policies don’t cover Airbnb rentals, home-share hosts are vulnerable to denied claims or even canceled coverage if their insurer discovers that their home doubles as a business. Slice helps solve this problem by supplementing a host’s existing homeowner’s policy and eliminating the possibility of losses being reported to the host’s insurer. What’s more, Slice is unique in that its insurance offering is completely on-demand: coverage is billed by the night, and hosts only pay for the exact amount of coverage they need.&nbsp;</p><p>Other startups like <a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a> focus on underserved segments of the auto market. Buckle provides rideshare drivers with one policy to cover their personal driving and rideshare driving. Instead of supplementing an existing auto policy, Buckle replaces a driver’s current auto insurance and provides continuous 24x7 coverage at one low rate. While traditional insurance companies evaluate factors like age and driving history, Buckle takes other driving elements into account, such as rideshare star rating. Buckle launched its core rideshare insurance policy in 2019 and announced a partnership with Lyft earlier this year.</p><p><strong>Underwriting Gap</strong></p><p>The underwriting gap addresses high consumer policy cost through providing more accurate, personalized underwriting. This encompasses solutions like Auto Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://www.metromile.com/">Metromile</a>, <a href="https://www.joinroot.com/">Root</a>) and Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers (<a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Startups like <a href="https://www.metromile.com/">Metromile</a> provide coverage based on miles driven, tracking mileage using an in-car dongle that pairs to a smartphone app, while <a href="https://www.joinroot.com/">Root</a> considers over 200 driving behavior variables such as braking, driving time of day, miles driven, and more. By using telematics data to improve coverage accuracy, these companies offer an improved insurance product for consumers, saving them money relative to legacy carriers. Root weighs driver behavior significantly more than traditional insurers: behavior has a 35% influence on rates, compared to just 3% for traditional carriers.&nbsp;</p><p>–&nbsp;–&nbsp;–</p><p>The rise of insurtech over the last 10 years demonstrates insurers’ focus on tech across new areas including on-demand and usage-based insurance. As partners to incumbents and independently licensed insurers, insurtech startups utilize tech to reimagine and improve stale insurance products.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>If you have any questions on the piece or curious about hearing more, contact <a href="mailto:joe@radicleinsights.com">joe@radicleinsights.com</a></strong></p><p>                                                       <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/app/insurance_now">The full Radar can be found <strong>here</strong>.</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

     <p><i>By Wojciech Gryc on October 20, 2020</i>
     
     </p><center><img src="https://phaseai.com/static/img/blogpost_portfolio_full.jpg"></center>

     <p>An important part of seeking a data-oriented job is putting together a data science portfolio. Portfolios help candidates stand out to hiring managers and potential companies they could work at.

     </p><h2>Why have a portfolio?</h2>

     <p>Most data professionals are subject matter experts and have deep areas of expertise, but this also makes it difficult for people to understand what they actually do. A hiring manager or recruiter reviewing 100s of resumes and CVs doesn't have the time to understand each candidate's expertise, jargon, or nuanced innovations.

     </p><h2>Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes</h2>

     <p>Help the hiring manager understand your capabilities by emphasizing the end-to-end projects you've organized and launched; make sure to describe everything in plain language.
     
     </p><p>First, begin by picking one project that best emphasizes your fit for a specific role. Describe the problem you addressed and how you solved it. Limit your discussion to 3 or 4 sentences, and use visual cues (screenshots, diagrams, or photographs) where you can. Most importantly, avoid jargon!
     
     </p><p>Your ultimate goal is to ensure those reading your project overview will be able to describe it to someone else. It's OK if they miss the technical nuances, as long as they understand what problem you solved and how effective your solution was.

     </p><h2>A checklist for your portfolio</h2>

     <p>Here are some specific pieces of advice:
</p><ul><li>Pick one project to emphasize; one you either ran or where you made a very clear contribution.
</li><li>Emphasize your role and what innovation, data research, or piece of work you completed there.
</li><li>Link to the end result, whether it was a research paper, conference talk, product launch, or something else.
</li><li>If possible, include visual cues, screenshots, photographs, or diagrams. This makes the portfolio engaging and more interesting.
</li><li>Summarize the above in 3 sentences and practice speaking about it. Avoid jargon to ensure non-experts understand what the project was about.
</li></ul>

     <p>The last point is critical: given the many candidates recruiters and hiring managers speak with, being able to summarize the end result without any jargon will help those hiring for the role remember it, speak to their colleagues about it, and ultimately evangelize you as a candidate. If you have a visual component to the portfolio, then that makes it shareable, too!

     </p><h2>Pro-tip: build a personal website</h2>

     <p>Candidates often ask if having a personal website is helpful, and our recommendation is <i>yes</i>. You need not have a fancy one, but the point is to have your latest resume there, along with links to your portfolio. Leading with a visual, pithy (3 sentences!) summary of each portfolio item will enable the hiring manager to review the work quickly and share it easily with colleagues. Most importantly, it'll help them understand how you will contribute to their own company's data science objectives.

     </p><h2>Still need help?</h2>

                  <p>Want to get better at something or at least do it more? Make it as easy as possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been making music at home for a long time, and have been talking to people about making music at home for even longer. During that time, the single best piece of advice I’ve gotten from people I admire is this: leave your gear set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/1*J1S_DFJBFoikbMv2-vk-jA.jpeg" alt="Buy my records please"><em>Buy my records please</em></p>

<p>If you want to play more, or get better, or both, having everything all set up and ready to go will make you approximately 1,000,000 times more likely to actually do it. This is scientifically proven.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the other day that this idea potentially generalizes to a whole bunch of other things that people typically want to do more or get better at: exercising, writing, making pottery, whatever.</p>

<p>The basic idea is this: make it as easy as possible to just get started and you’ll be so much more likely to actually do it. For running, maybe that means setting time aside and setting your clothes and shoes out the night before. Writing? A quiet spot and fifteen minutes should be enough.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What gear do I have stashed in the closet, messy and unplugged, that should actually be out and ready on my desk, ready to make my next hit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you’ve got your answer, take tonight to set it up, and make tomorrow day one of a long, fulfilling streak.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Back in 2010 I was contemplating my next move after working on Microsoft's Project Oslo. Oslo was an effort to deliver 10X productivity to developers which inspired me to set the following criteria for my next job:</p><ol><li><strong>Iterate with Developers:</strong> I want to work in a place where we can start small, get something in the hands of developers and then iterate over the product to solve real problems.</li><li><strong>Cloud:</strong> So far I had been focussed on building platforms using bare-metal products.  But I was starting to see the kind of requirements modern applications have around scale and resiliency.  I knew Cloud had to be huge part of the experience to deliver on those requirements.</li></ol><h2>Start of Journey</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jv8et2b448mjtifrh1wy.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>The Oslo framework led me to join the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/swf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Simple Workflow (SWF)</a> team.  The team was led by Maxim Fateev, who came from a strong messaging background. Maxim was one of the most brilliant software engineers I had ever worked with, especially when it came to designing large scale distributed systems.  Little did I know that I was about to embark on a long journey which is still being written to this day.</p><p>When I joined, the team was wrapping up a second version of the service which was already seeing decent usage within AWS.  Even at the time, we could clearly see a pattern emerging. Developers were spending significant amounts of time building resiliency into applications, using low level primitives like queues, databases, retry mechanisms, durable timers, etc. Those same developers were able to produce higher quality systems with far less effort when using SWF instead of implementing resiliency themselves.  Considering how useful the service was within AWS, the next natural step was to offer SWF publicly. I was part of the core team which worked on the public version of SWF which was launched in early 2012.</p><h2>Durable Task Framework (DTFx)</h2><p><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/monitor.png"></p><p>After shipping the public SWF service, I took an opportunity at Microsoft Azure and ended up joining the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Service Bus</a> team that owns the messaging stack for Azure.  Cloud was steadily gaining momentum and as more and more workloads started to get migrated, teams like Azure Service Bus became a focal point.  As application developers increasingly started adopting microservices architecture to keep up with scale and availability requirements for modern applications, services like Azure Service Bus became the backbone to orchestrate calls across microservices.  To keep up with the explosive growth, I worked as part of the team focused on large scale ingestion through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure EventHubs</a>.  This solved the scalability and reliability issues at a messaging layer but developers still had to work with very low level primitives whenever they need to reliably orchestrate calls across microservices.  The result was complex architectures which were expensive to build, hard to operate, and still came with reliability challenges. Reliability challenges stemming from all sorts of failure cases which needed to be handled due to the distributed nature of the application.</p><p>I could clearly see that the developers building applications on Microsoft Azure were facing eerily similar challenges to what I had seen back at AWS. The same challenges we had tried to address with SWF.  So I used one of the internal team hackathons as an opportunity to pair up with Affan Dar and take another stab at solving the problem. Affan had a very deep understanding of Azure ServiceBus so he was the perfect person to build the backend for the stateful C# experience I had in mind.  Microsoft had recently added async/await capabilities into C# and it turned out to be an amazing fit for writing stateful applications which need to orchestrate calls among microservices.  Since Java lacked an async/await like primitive, we had to rely on Promise-based async approach when building SWF.  But with C#, we were able to deliver a much cleaner and synchronous programming model using async/await.  This hackathon project resulted in Azure <a href="https://github.com/Azure/durabletask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durable Task Framework</a> as an OSS client SDK which uses Azure ServiceBus as the backend to provide a stateful workflow-as-code experience for applications. I'm so glad to see Microsoft has continued investing in the experience with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Durable Functions</a> as the latest reincarnation of the original effort. An effort which started with that hackathon project.</p><h2>Transportation as Reliable as Running Water</h2><p><img src="https://d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net/uber-sites/f452c7aefd72a6f52b36705c8015464e.jpg"></p><p>In 2015, Uber opened a development center in Seattle and I decided to take the leap and join the engineering team.  Coincidently enough, Maxim Fateev ended up joining the Uber team in Seattle only a month after I did. At the time, Uber was running on Kafka 7 as the messaging backbone. Based on the scale they were running, they were encountering some serious operational issues. Considering Maxim and I had more than a decade worth of experience building messaging systems similar to Kafka, we decided to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber-archive/cherami-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherami</a> to address this Uber sized problem. After a year of working on the project, we were observing a very similar pattern to the one that we tried to solve with SWF and Durable Task Framework. When engineers needed to build with raw infrastructure primitives like queues and databases they were spending 80% of their time building resiliency into the application.  This was clearly not sustainable for Uber, which was growing at an amazing pace and building a brand of "Transportation as Reliable as Running Water".  This need to increase developer productivity without compromising on reliability of the system was the motivation for Maxim and I to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber/cadence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cadence</a>.  Within a very short period of time, we built a multi-tenant service hosted by our team. Cadence provided a great developer experience by enabling developers to use Golang to build and run stateful applications with very little operational overhead.  Cadence grew organically within Uber and quickly became popular among developers. It slowly but surely began to emerge as the standard way to build stateful applications when reliability cannot be compromised.</p><h2>Magic of Open Source</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8llekr4lqjmaok138su4.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>Today, more businesses are turning to software for running mission critical parts of the system and software is becoming key part of the end-user experience. The problems faced by engineers at places like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Uber have become more and more common across the industry.  This belief was validated in early 2019. Developers from companies like Hashicorp, Box, Doordash, Checkr and dozens of other places organically discovered the Temporal technology and immediately started using it for their mission critical workloads.</p><p>We have a strong belief that an infrastructure technology of this magnitude needs to built as an Open-source project.  This led both Maxim and I to quit our jobs at Uber and launch <a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal Technologies</a> in October 2019.  Over the last year we made huge advances with our developer experience and released <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal</a> as an Open Source Software under <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT license</a>.  We recently launched our first production release of <a href="https://docs.temporal.io/blog/temporal-v1-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal v1.0.0</a> which is already being used by numerous companies for critical workloads.</p><p><a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://temporal.io</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/temporalio/temporal</a></p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The web application my development team is building at work provides a lot of data to our users, including downloadable Excel spreadsheets that can sometimes contain up to 250,000 rows’ worth of information. And our users have the ability to generate these reports, on demand, from our tool.</p><p>As you may imagine, it can sometimes take several minutes or more to compile this much data, and waiting around looking at a loading animation while our report service crunches numbers in the background wouldn’t be a great user experience.</p><p>Instead, we needed a way to check when the report service was done generating a report, without blocking a user from doing other work in our application while that was going on. We needed <strong>polling</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes when building web applications, you’re going to need to keep track of data being created or updated asynchronously by another service. Polling, is one way to accomplish this, and all it is, is simply hitting an API’s endpoint to retrieve any new data at a set interval of time.</p><p>This is exactly the type of solution my team needed to implement — a way to periodically keep checking if the reports (being generated by our separate report service) were done, so they could be displayed in the UI for our users to download once they were. And we needed a solution that would work for React.</p><p>Today, I’ll be sharing how easy it is to leverage a custom React Hook called <code>useInterval</code>, to poll an API within your application for fresh data (or really run any task that needs intervals).</p><h2 id="polling-vs-webhooks">Polling VS Webhooks</h2><p>An alternative to polling is webhooks. Webhooks are a common way for one app to notify of an event, in real-time, to another app.</p><p>Webhooks are often referred to as “reverse APIs” because the app consuming the data does not do so by sending an HTTP request to another API — instead, it makes an API available for the app sending the data (usually, a POST HTTP request).</p><h3 id="example-getting-notified-when-a-new-component-is-available">Example: Getting notified when a new component is available</h3><p>Let’s say one of your teammates has published a component to your shared component collection. You might want to use it in your current project but how would you know that it’s now available?</p><p>One way would be by polling. </p><p>Another, more elegant and efficient way, would be by using <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/introducing-bit-dev-webhooks-78dade77c6da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">webhooks</a>.</p><hr><p>Why am I telling you about webhooks in a post about polling? Well, it’s something to keep in mind when you’re building a solution for a problem that’s potentially solved by both techniques. It may very well be that you don’t actually have an option and polling is the only available solution but if that’s not the case, you should at least consider webhooks.</p><h2 id="intervals-from-react-classes-to-react-hooks">Intervals from React Classes to React Hooks</h2><p>Before I dive into the custom useInterval Hook, let me briefly review how polling at intervals used to work in React when we could only use class-based components to work with our state.</p><h3 id="setinterval-the-old-way-to-poll-in-react-classes">SetInterval: The Old Way to Poll in React Classes</h3><p>Back in the days when we used to be restricted to class-based components for state changes, polling was typically started on the <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle method as soon as the component was mounted in the DOM. And as long as the component stayed mounted, the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>setInterval()</code></a> function would continue indefinitely. Upon unmounting the component with <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>, the interval will be cleared and stop running with <code>clearInterval()</code>. Here’s an example of that code below.</p><p><code>PollingSample.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="how-polling-intervals-used-to-work-in-React">
<em>A simple example of how polling intervals used to work in React.</em></p><p>In the example above, I just have the <code>PollingExample</code>’s <code>pollingCount</code> state updating every 3 seconds, as determined by the <code>delay</code>, which is currently set to 3000ms.</p><p>When the component mounts, the <code>setInterval()</code> starts running, and every 3 seconds it increments the <code>pollingCount</code>’s state by 1 by calling the <code>tick()</code> function, which actually updates the state. Once the <code>PollingExample</code> component unmounts from the DOM, the <code>clearInterval()</code> function is called and the interval stops running.</p><p>This works fine, but if multiple components need intervals to poll for different data or execute other tasks on an interval, there can be a lot of redundant, interval-related code scattered among the components.</p><p>Setting up a running interval is pretty simple, but now that we’ve got React Hooks there’s an even simpler, cleaner way to encapsulate polling data into a custom Hook.</p><h3 id="useinterval-the-new-way-to-poll-with-react-hooks">UseInterval: The New Way to Poll with React Hooks</h3><p>When React Hooks first came out, people were critical that <code>setInterval()</code> didn’t work with Hooks the way that it had with React’s class-based components.</p><p>And it’s true, it doesn’t. Dan Abramov <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> a very in-depth explanation of why this is the case (and does a fantastic job of explaining it, so I’ll continue to leave that to him). But in addition to demystifying how <code>setInterval()</code> works with React’s lifecycles like <code>componentDidMount()</code>, he also introduced the new Hooks-way of correctly writing intervals to work in function-based React components.</p><p>He introduced a new custom hook called <code>useInterval</code>, and it’s awesome, easy to use, and just what my team needed. Here’s the code for the Hook, taken just as Dan <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> it, and added right to my team’s project in our <code>hooks/</code> folder. </p><h4 id="the-useinterval-hook">The useInterval Hook</h4><p><code>useInterval.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png 826w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" alt="custom-interval-hook">
<em>The code for the custom useInterval Hook, just as Dan Abramov wrote it.</em></p><p>This <code>useInterval</code> Hook sets up an interval and clears it after the component unmounts. It’s a combo of <code>setInterval()</code> and <code>clearInterval()</code>, but all wrapped into one easy-to-implement Hook.</p><p>All you need to do to get the Hook to work is supply it a function (the <code>callback</code> parameter) and an interval time (the <code>delay</code>). Simple!</p><p>With this Hook, more than half the battle is already over, now you’re ready to drop this interval Hook wherever you need it in your code. For me and my team, that happened to be in the reports page.</p><h4 id="putting-useinterval-to-use">Putting useInterval to Use</h4><p><code>ReportsPage.js</code></p><p>Here’s a condensed version of my <code>ReportsPage</code> functional component with the <code>useInterval</code> Hook imported at the top of the component and dropped into the code.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="useInterval-hook-encapsulates-interval-logic">
<em>Instead of managing multiple component lifecycles, the useInterval hook encapsulates all the interval logic into itself, making it easy to reuse in many places in the code.</em></p><p>In my component, the <code>useInterval</code> Hook takes in an asynchronous call to fetch any reports that have been generated the by the report service (<code>reportService.getGeneratedReports()</code>), and then it updates the reports available for download in the UI with <code>setReports()</code>.</p><p>For ease-of-updating the interval timing if need be, I’m using a constant called <code>REPORT_REFRESH_INTERVAL</code>, which is set to run this polling interval every 15 seconds while the component is mounted.</p><p>I added the <code>console.log</code> so it’s easier to tell if the interval is running correctly.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" alt="confirms-running-on-an-interval">
<em>Inelegant? Maybe. Confirms it’s running on an interval? Sure does.</em></p><p>The count of 11 ahead of the logged message <code>"Checking if reports are ready to download"</code> demonstrates that the <code>useInterval</code> Hook is firing at regular intervals while users are on the Report page. If you checked the Network panel right now in the Developer Tools, you’d also see 11 individual API calls to the <code>reportService</code>’s <code>getGeneratedReports()</code> REST endpoint.</p><p>Once the user navigates to a different page or component, you’ll see the API calls cease with no extra code on my part. Only if the user returns to the Reports page will the polling for reports resume.</p><p>How simple is that? Instead of having to write multiple instances of <code>setInterval()</code>, <code>clearInterval()</code> inside of your class-based components’ lifecycles when you need intervals, you can have one <code>useInterval</code> Hook that can drop into any functional component anywhere in the app that you need polling.</p><p>Now that’s how you poll efficiently with a custom React Hook. And you could use this very same Hook anywhere in your code that an interval is needed.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Sometimes you need a simple way to check if an asynchronous task being performed by a separate service is done or not. Polling is one way to do this; hitting an endpoint over and over at some set interval to check for fresh data to display in the UI.</p><p>With the introduction of React Hooks, and especially the ability to put together custom Hooks, creating a reusable Hook called <code>useInterval</code> to serve just such a purpose seemed inevitable. Dan Abramov, part of the React core team, obliged, and the real beauty of it is, this Hook is highly reusable. It can be dropped anywhere in the app, to run any sort of task, at any interval with next to no effort. That’s the kind of solution I like.</p><p>Check back in a few weeks — I’ll be writing more about JavaScript, React, ES6, or something else related to web development.</p><p>Thanks for reading. If you need intervals in your React app and you’re using Hooks, consider adding this <code>useInterval</code> Hook to your arsenal, it’s a cinch to use and easy to customize to your specific needs.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/polling-in-react-using-the-useinterval-custom-hook-e2bcefda4197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">original article</a> or more interesting posts on <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/@paigen11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Paige</a>’s blog.</p><h2 id="if-you-enjoyed-reading-this-you-may-also-enjoy-some-of-my-other-free-pieces">If you enjoyed reading this, you may also enjoy some of my other free pieces:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/animating-reactjs-with-react-transition-group-2af6c87cab0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Animating React with React Transition Group”</a></li><li><a href="https://itnext.io/javascripts-optional-chaining-proposal-bc9e6e5f2877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“JavaScript’s Optional Chaining Proposal”</a></li><li><a href="https://itnext.io/destructuring-arrays-objects-javascript-es6-feature-series-pt-10-507108471c07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Destructuring Arrays &amp; Objects: JavaScript ES6 Feature Series (Pt 10)”</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="references-and-further-resources">References and Further Resources</h3><ul><li>Dan Abramov’s blog post on Overreacted <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Making setInterval Declarative with React Hooks”</a></li></ul><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p><a href="https://asayer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Asayer</a> is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your web app behaves for every issue.

          <h2 id="a-changing-industry">A changing industry</h2><p>These are interesting times for Real Estate. </p><p>“Uncertainty” has become the mantra for industry analysts when asked what will happen in the coming months following the wake of a pandemic-fueled economic crisis. Nobody knows when or how the “new normal” is going to hit them. Yet, as tenants pause leasing decisions and implement work-from-home strategies, some CRE companies are preparing to fight back.</p><p>As this <a href="https://www.avisonyoung.com/documents/20342/571064/COVID-19+-+Evaluating+the+New+Normal+in+Commercial+Real+Estate/c4c3df5d-6f20-4c4f-941f-6ce6a955d3d6">Avison Young report</a> states, the return to normalcy will likely occur in stages for many real estate branches. While some firms are confident that a return to the office is certain, others are doubling down on efforts in their innovation programs to ensure the new home-based agents have the right tools to navigate their work. These efforts aren’t simply focused on the current crisis, but on what comes <em>next</em> in the digital future.<br></p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/develop-commercial-RE-app-1-2.png" alt="Property type and lease terminations - nar.realtor"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-market-recovery-survey-07-09-2020.pdf">nar.realtor</a></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the future, the words of a recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2020/08/19/why-cre-companies-need-to-be-at-the-forefront-of-technology/#7267d3a158e7">Forbes</a> article seem to be carrying weight: </p><blockquote>The time has come for CRE to be at the forefront of technology. </blockquote><p>But how do you even begin to take up that challenge? “We’re a real estate company, not a tech company,” you might say. While it may <em>seem</em> contrary to your mission, I assure you it is not. Now more than ever I’m hearing companies refer to themselves as, “tech companies that specialize in [insert industry here].” This is the mindset that will help you adapt for the future while delivering the value and guidance your clients expect.</p><p>Building an application can be a first step in the right direction.</p><h2 id="how-can-a-software-application-help">How can a software application help?</h2><p>Whether you work on the commercial or residential side of things, there are common problems you’ll face when it comes to building an app for your users. Just like solutions for the financial or insurance industries, real estate apps have to be simple and intuitive for your user. Whether the users are internal or external, they must be able to quickly understand the app, connect with the trusted third-party databases your company uses, and provide bullet-proof security layers for handling sensitive data.</p><h3 id="facilitating-the-buying-experience">Facilitating the buying experience</h3><p><em>Building with the customer in mind</em></p><p>In today’s crowded market, valuations and listings are not enough for your prospective buyers. </p><ul><li><strong>Capital market investors</strong> need to have as much real time data as possible about the property they put their eyes on. Understanding which availabilities in the market fit their risk criteria, the building age, and ROI of the property are just a few key insights that are expected when making a decision. Not being able to physically visit and tour their locations adds further complexity to the current sale/lease process. </li><li><strong>Potential tenants</strong> want to have comprehensive info about current lease expiration dates, the history of the building, and the previous occupants. With the buying experience increasingly going virtual, in-person tours have become pretty limited. Clients are becoming more untrusting of face-to-face interactions and, in turn, they’re showing preference to companies that can bring the property touring experience into their phone &amp; computer screens.</li></ul><p>From touring to closing the deal, enabling the digital experience for tenants and investors <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/en/views/technology-adoption-in-commercial-real-estate">has been proven to make a difference</a> for many companies.

Brokers are struggling with the demands on them to rapidly provide insights to their tenants and landlords. Demonstrating that they can provide unparalleled guidance by leveraging tech will save both the brokers and the buyers time and energy. Both parties will be grateful for it. The office space is already seeing a decrease in demand for square footage as work-from-home tenants push to reduce their exposure and spaces are being reconfigured (and downsized).

Realistic renderings of what the finished space may look like, virtual tours, 3D floor plans, space planning tools that are quickly customizable to the tenant’s needs, and easy access to a lawyer and notary if a deal is to be completed are all a few examples.

				<p>Today, network address translators are everywhere. Their ubiquitous adoption was promoted neither by design nor by planning but by the continued growth of the Internet, which brings forth an ever-increasing demand not only on IP address space but also on other functional requirements that network address translation (NAT) is perceived to facilitate. This article provides a personal perspective on the history of NAT, the lessons we may learn from it, and some articulations on best ways forward from where we are today.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>NAT commonly refers to a box that interconnects a local network to the public Internet, where the local network runs on a block of private IPv4 addresses as specified in RFC 1918. In the original Internet architecture design, each IP address is defined to be globally unique and globally reachable. In contrast, a private IPv4 address is meaningful only within the scope of the local network behind a NAT and, as such, the same private address block can be reused in multiple local networks, as long as those networks do not directly talk to each other. Instead, they communicate with each other-and with the rest of Internet-through NAT boxes.</p>
<p>Like most unexpected successes, NAT’s ubiquitous adoption was not foreseen when the idea first emerged more than 15 years ago (RFC 1287 and RFC 1335). Back then, had anyone foreseen where NAT would be today, it is possible that the NAT deployment itself might have followed a different path: one that was better planned and standardised. The set of Internet protocols that have developed over the past 15 years might have also evolved differently, and we might have seen less overall complexity in the Internet than what we have today.</p>
<p>Although the clock cannot be turned back, I believe it’s a worth-while exercise to revisit the history of NAT so that we may learn some useful lessons. It may also be worthwhile to assess-or reassess-the pros and cons of NAT, as well as to take a look at where we are today in our handling of NAT and how best to proceed into the future.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasise that this writing represents a personal view, and my recall of history is likely to be incomplete and to contain errors. My personal view on this subject has also changed substantially over time, and it may continue to evolve, as we are all in a continuing process of understanding this fascinating and dynamically changing Internet.</p>
<p><strong>How NAT Works</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://isoc.org/wp/ietfjournal/files/2007/10/Lixia3.jpg" alt="Lixia Zhang and Tony Li at IETF 69 in Chicago"><br>
<em>Lixia Zhang and Tony Li at IETF 69 in Chicago</em></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, IP addresses were designed to be globally unique and globally reachable. This property of the IP address is a fundamental building block in supporting the Internet’s end-to-end architecture. Until very recently, almost all of the Internet protocol designs, especially those below the application layer, have been based on the aforementioned IP address model. However, the explosive growth of the Internet in early 1990s not only signalled the danger of IP address space exhaustion but also created an instant demand on the IP addresses: suddenly, connecting large numbers of user networks and home computers demanded IP addresses instantly and in large quantity. Such demand could not possibly be met by going through the regular IP address allocation process. NAT came into play to meet that instant high demand.</p>
<p>Because NAT was not standardised before its wide deployment, a number of different NAT products exist today, each with somewhat different functionality and different technical details. Since this article is about the history of NAT deployment-and not an explanation of how to traverse specific NAT boxes-I will describe a popular NAT implementation as an illustrative example. Interested readers may visit Wikipedia to find out more about various NAT products.</p>
<p>A NAT box <strong>N</strong> has a public IP address for its interface connecting to the global Internet and a private address facing the internal network. N serves as the default router for all of the destinations that are outside the local NAT address block. When internal host <strong>H</strong> sends an IP packet <strong>P</strong> to a public IP destination address <strong>D</strong> in the global Internet, the packet will be routed to <strong>N. N</strong> translates the private source IP address in <strong>P</strong>‘s header to its public IP address and adds an entry to its internal table that keeps track of the mapping between the internal host and the outgoing packet. This entry represents a piece of state, which enables all subsequent packet exchanges between <strong>H</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. For example, when <strong>D</strong> sends a packet <strong>P’</strong> in response to <strong>P, P’</strong> will arrive at N, and N can find the corresponding entry from its mapping table and replace the destination IP address-which is its own public IP address-with the real destination address <strong>H</strong>, so that <strong>P’</strong> will be delivered to <strong>H</strong>. This mapping entry times out after a certain period of idleness, which is normally set to a vendor-specific value. In the process of changing the IP address carried in the IP header of each passing packet, a NAT box must also recalculate the IP header checksum-as well as the transport protocol’s checksum-if it is calculated based on the IP address, as in the cases for TCP and UDP check-sums.</p>
<p>From this description, it is easy to see the major benefit of NAT: one can connect a large number of hosts to the global Internet by using a single public IP address. Other benefits of NAT also became clear over time, as discussed in more detail later.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of NAT’s drawbacks can also be identified immediately. First and foremost, NAT changed the end-to-end communication model of the Internet architecture in a fundamental way: Instead of allowing any host to talk directly to any other host on the Internet, hosts behind a NAT now must go through the NAT to reach others, and all communications through a NAT box can be initiated only by an internal host first in order to set up the mapping entries. In addition, since ongoing data exchange depends on the mapping entry kept at the NAT box, the box represents a single point of failure: if the NAT box crashes, it may lose all of the existing state, and the data exchange between all of the internal and external hosts will have to be restarted. This is in contrast to the original IP’s goal of delivering packets to their destinations as long as any physical connectivity exists between the source and destination. Furthermore, because NAT alters the IP addresses carried in a packet, all protocols that are dependent on IP addresses are affected. In certain cases, such as TCP checksum, which includes IP addresses in the calculation, the NAT box can hide the address change by recalculating the TCP checksum when forwarding a packet. For some of the other protocols that make direct use of IP addresses, such as IPSec, the protocols can no longer operate on the end-to-end basis as originally designed; for some application protocols that embed IP addresses in the application data, application-level gateways are needed to handle the IP address rewrite. As discussed later, NAT also introduced some other drawbacks that surfaced only recently.</p>
<p><strong>A Recall of NAT History</strong></p>
<p>I started graduate school at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work on network research at the same time as RFC 791, the Internet Protocol Specification, was published in September 1981. Thus I was fortunate to witness the most fascinating unfolding of this new system called the Internet. During the next 10 years, the Internet grew rapidly. RFC 1287, Towards the Future Internet Architecture, was published in 1991 and is probably the first RFC that raised the concern about IP address space exhaustion in a foreseeable future.</p>
<p>RFC 1287 also discussed three possible directions for extending IP address space. The first one pointed to a direction similar to today’s NAT:</p>
<p>Replace the 32 bit field with a feld of the same size but with different meaning. Instead of being globally unique, it would now be unique only within some smaller region …</p>
<p>RFC 1335, published in May 1992, provides a more elaborate description of the use of internal IP addresses (in other words, private IP addresses) as a solution to IP address exhaustion. The first paper describing the NAT idea, “Extending the IP Internet Through Address Reuse,” appeared in the January 1993 issue of Computer Communication Review and was published a year later as RFC 1663. Although these RFCs may be considered forerunners in the development of NAT, as explained later, for various reasons the IETF did not take actions to standardise NAT.</p>
<p>The invention of the Web further accelerated Internet growth in the early 1990s. The explosive growth underlined the urgency to take action toward solving both the routing scalability and the address shortage problems. The IETF took several follow-up steps, which eventually led to the launch of the IPng development effort. I believe the expectation at the time was to get a new IP developed within a few years, followed by a quick deployment. However, the actual deployment during the next 10 years took a rather unexpected path.</p>
<p><strong>The planned solution</strong></p>
<p>As pointed out in RFC 1287, the continued growth of the Internet exposed strains in the Internet architecture as originally designed, the two most urgent of which were routing system scalability and exhaustion of IP address space. Since long-term solutions require a long lead time to develop and deploy, efforts started on developing both a short-term solution and a longterm solution to those problems.</p>
<p>Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, was proposed as a shortterm solution. CIDR removed the class boundaries embedded in the IP address structure, thus enabling more efficient address allocation, which helped extend the lifetime of IP address space. CIDR also facilitated routing aggregation, which slowed the growth of the routing table. However, as stated in RFC 1481, IAB Recommendation for an Intermediate Strategy to Address the Issue of Scaling, “This strategy (CIDR) presumes that a suitable longterm solution is being …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- s9ymdb:496 --><p><img width="300" height="303" src="https://blog.hboeck.de/uploads/bluebutton.jpg" alt="Blue Button">BigBlueButton is a free web-based video conferencing software that lately got quite popular, largely due to Covid-19. Earlier this year I did a brief check on its security which led to an <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/big-blue-button-das-grosse-blaue-sicherheitsrisiko-2010-151610.html">article on Golem.de (German)</a>. I want to share the most significant findings here.</p><p>

BigBlueButton has a feature that lets a presenter upload a presentation in a wide variety of file formats that gets then displayed in the web application. This looked like a huge attack surface. The conversion for many file formats is done with Libreoffice on the server. Looking for ways to exploit server-side Libreoffice rendering I found a <a href="https://buer.haus/2019/10/18/a-tale-of-exploitation-in-spreadsheet-file-conversions/">blog post by Bret Buerhaus</a> that discussed a number of ways of exploiting such setups.</p><p>

One of the methods described there is a feature in Opendocument Text (ODT) files that allows embedding a file from an external URL in a text section. This can be a web URL like https or a file url and include a local file.</p><p>

This directly worked in BigBlueButton. An ODT file that referenced a local file would display that local file. This allows displaying any file that the user running the BigBlueButton service could access on the server. A possible way to exploit this is to exfiltrate the configuration file that contains the API secret key, which then allows basically controlling the BigBlueButton instance. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op2hc2Z56a8">video showing the exploit here</a>. (I will publish the exploit later.)</p><p>

I reported this to the developers of BigBlueButton in May. Unfortunately my experience with their security process was not very good. At first I did not get an answer at all. After another mail they told me they plan to sandbox the Libreoffice process either via a chroot or a docker container. However that still has not happened yet. It is planned for the upcoming version 2.3 and independent of this bug this is a good idea, as Libreoffice just creates a lot of attack surface.</p><p>

Recently I looked a bit more into this.  The functionality to include external files only happens after a manual user confirmation and if one uses Libreoffice on the command line it does not work at all by default. So in theory this exploit should not have worked, but it did.</p><p>

It turned out the reason for this was another piece of software that BigBlueButton uses called <a herf="https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter">JODConverter</a>. It provides a wrapper around the conversion functionality of Libreoffice. After contacting both the Libreoffice security team and the developer of JODConverter we figured out that it enables including external URLs by default.</p><p>

I forwarded this information to the BigBlueButton developers and it finally let to a fix, they now change the default settings of JODConverter manually. The JODConverter developer considers changing the default as well, but this has not happened yet. Other software or web pages using JODConverter for serverside file conversion may thus still be vulnerable.</p><p>

The fix was included in version 2.2.27. Today I learned that the company RedTeam Pentesting <a href="https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2020-005/-arbitrary-file-disclosure-and-server-side-request-forgery-in-bigbluebutton">has later independently found the same vulnerability</a>. They also requested a CVE: It is now filed as CVE-2020-25820.</p><p>

While this issue is fixed, the handling of security issues by BigBlueButton was not exactly stellar. It took around five months from my initial report to a fix. The <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.2.27">release notes</a> do not mention that this is an important security update (the change has the note “speed up the conversion”).</p><p>

I found a bunch of other security issues in BigBlueButton and proposed some hardening changes. This took a lot of back and forth, but all significant issues are resolved now.</p><p>

Another issue with the presentation upload was that it allowed cross site scripting, because it did not set a proper content type for downloads. This was independently discovered by another person and was fixed a while ago. (If you are interested in details about this class of vulnerabilities: I have given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t8JYpt0egE">a talk about it at last year’s Security Fest</a>.)</p><p>

The session Cookies both from BigBlueButton itself and from its default web frontend Greenlight were not set with a secure flag, so the cookies could be transmitted in clear text over the network. This has also been changed now.</p><p>

By default the BigBlueButton installation script starts several services that open ports that do not need to be publicly accessible. This is now also changed. A freeswitch service run locally was installed with a default password (“ClueCon”), this is now also changed to a random password by the installation script.</p><p>

What also looks quite problematic is the use of outdated software. BigBlueButton only works on Ubuntu 16.04, which is a long term support version, so it still receives updates. But it also uses several external repositories, including one that installs NodeJS version 8 and shows a warning that this repository no longer receives security updates. There is an <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/issues/109">open bug in the bug tracker</a>.</p><p>

If you are using BigBlueButton I strongly recommend you update to at least version 2.2.27. This should fix all the issues I found. I would wish that the BigBlueButton developers improve their security process, react more timely to external reports and more transparent when issues are fixed.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In late April, as coronavirus shutdowns across the US caused millions to lose their jobs overnight, the food security system imploded. Viral photos on social media showed massive food bank lines wrapped around city blocks and it seemed like the food supply chain was at risk of collapsing. It was around that time that <a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric Ries</a> reached out to a small group including myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Justin Mares</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffnobbs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jeff Nobbs</a> to see if we could help him come up with a model to feed the people excluded from the existing food security system.</p>
<p>Together, we thought of an idea that could simultaneously help both those experiencing hunger and the restaurants facing unprecedented economic disruption. By building a lightweight tech solution, we could connect those who needed meals with restaurants that had the need for customers as COVID-19 evaporated their customer base. We’d fund the meals on the back end, through donations. </p>
<p>We started small (insert lean startup joke), and our V1 was a no-code Twilio bot that asked the person texting it a few questions to figure out location, how many meals they needed, and their first name. The bot deposited those requests into Airtable, where we could manually match them with a restaurant. We used an Airtable block to send out Twilio SMS messages right from our spreadsheet — and gave restaurants a read-only view of their "database" where they could see the orders we’d matched with them. Once a meal was picked up, the restaurant could click a link in the table, which would trigger a Zapier workflow to mark the meal as fulfilled.</p>
<p>Once this was ready to test, Jeff handed out the Twilio number via flyers to those at the back of the foodbank lines in SF. As hundreds of requests started flowing in, we validated the technology and were amazed to see just how high the demand was for a service like this — another kind of validation as we moved forward.</p>

<p>A week later, we hit our first limit: We didn't have the human bandwidth to match the number of hungry families texting us. We could reasonably text and support 300-400 families a day, and the pick-up process was seamless. However, if more than 400 texts came in, our system broke down. As we added more restaurants in more neighborhoods, we began working on an automated solution. </p>
<p>One of our developer volunteers, <a href="https://twitter.com/jhdielman" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jason Dielman</a> of Twilio, started working on a Javascript-based algorithm that could plug directly into our Studio workflow via Twilio functions, allowing a lambda function to automatically match and direct people to their matched provider.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we needed a stopgap to handle our growing number of requests. I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidHead" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">David Head</a>, who, the last time I saw him, was running one of the most complex Google sheets I imagined existed. He jumped in and within a few days, built a Google Sheet matchmaker that could automatically assign users to matched restaurants. We kept it simple by always matching for the following day, and instead of collecting location, we asked those texting which neighborhoods they could most easily access. After testing, we launched and quickly saw our daily meals reach 1,000 meals served per day. It worked!</p>
<p>With a stable product able to meet the current need, we shifted our focus to building an overall more reliable service that could scale to other cities, as well as balance capacity across our network of restaurants. Jeff was building out an impressive operations effort with our restaurant partners, working with owners to get our cost per meal down from $10 on average to just above $7. As Eric and Justin worked on raising our first funds and putting that money to use, we needed to define a growth path that allowed us to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>In a Slack team, we assembled an amazing group of volunteer developers. <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USDR</a> connected us with <a href="https://twitter.com/wgyn_" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ryan Wang</a>, who wrote code to get user feedback, as well as "remember" repeat users to avoid collecting their details each time they text. Through Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTomMonks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tom Monks</a> joined up and helped us build functions to track our statistics and user inputs. Meanwhile, Jason and I plugged away at the automated system.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, we went live with V2, which we’re still running today. The new bot ensured that we could now handle thousands of requests per day. In San Francisco, we hit a new milestone: serving 20,000 meals in one week. </p>
<p>Here’s how V2 works:</p>
<p>When a user texts our number, we first run a number of checks. The first is to see what language they speak. We use keywords to identify language, as the bot is fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese. We then check if they’ve texted before, and if not, ask a few intake questions to best match them.</p>
<p>We then take their family size and zip code and run that through our meal-matching algorithm. Jason built an algorithm to balance restaurant capacity so that we can make sure we give each restaurant a consistent flow of meals per day. This is important for our provider owners, who use that consistency to avoid layoffs and keep their kitchens running. </p>
<p>The algorithm uses the Google Distance Matrix API to find the restaurants that have "balanced capacity" closest to our family in need. We then text back that family with three different pick-up options based on time and location. Now, we can match meals up to 3 days in advance. This way, if there isn’t a meal available in their neighborhood until tomorrow, they have the option to travel a bit farther to get a hot meal today. </p>
<p>Once they’re matched, we send over the name and address of the restaurant and a pickup window to get their meal. One of the most important pieces of this entire process for us is that the pickup process is as dignified as possible. We want all of our users to be able to walk into a restaurant and pick up a meal just like they would with a normal takeout order.</p>
<p>A few hours after the meal has been picked up, we send out a request for feedback. Ryan built out a function to collect a 1-5 star rating and a space for our users to comment on their experience, which then goes right back into the restaurant’s dashboard. We get to see what’s working on our end, and the restaurants get to improve their experience as well. </p>

      <p>A look at how LinkedIn exfiltrates browser extension data from your browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>How would you feel if you opened a program and the program started to check your file system to see what other programs you
      had installed? You would probably feel the software was overstepping. This is essentially what LinkedIn does when you visit their
      website. LinkedIn will scan your local browser files in an attempt to identify a number of different browser extensions you may
      have installed. The data collected by LinkedIn is then exfiltrated from the browser.</p>
      <p>
        This whole adventure started when I was browsing LinkedIn and happened to have my browser console open. While on my LinkedIn
        profile I noticed a large number of 404 errors and as a developer it piqued my interest.
        <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
          <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" alt="LinkedIn's website making local host web requests.">
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>What really piqued my curiosity was the fact all of these failed web requests were for <strong>chrome-extension://</strong>
      resources. After inspecting a few of the extension IDs in the resources I began to suspect LinkedIn was attempting to determine
      if I had certain extensions installed by executing local web requests to the browser itself.</p>
      <p>I spent some time toying around with my browser and LinkedIn's assets. Note, reverse engineering LinkedIn's source code is
      apparently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against their terms of service</a>. If I was
      LinkedIn I would probably not want people figuring out how I spy on them either.</p>
      <p>After poking around and doing some investigation I found an interesting object in one of LinkedIn's local storage values.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>

      <p>One of LinkedIn's local storage keys is <strong>C_C_M</strong>. The value itself is a base64 encoded string (which isn't too
      abnormal). However, if you decode the string you will see a large JSON blob that seems to be encoded with unicode code points (not
      human readable).</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to a browser console encoded with unicode.">
      </a>
      <p>I am not too sure how or why they encoded it that way, but it seems to me like it was in an attempt to obfuscate the data. The
      encoding is easy enough to reverse, simply parse the JSON. You can do it yourself with the following snippet:</p>
      <p><code>JSON.parse(atob(localStorage.getItem("C_C_M")));</code></p>
      <p>Doing so will display a large JavaScript object with some interesting data in it. Note, it appears the data held in this JSON
      blob is personalized to some degree. In other words, my JSON blob may be larger or smaller than yours. I am unsure which heuristic
      LinkedIn uses to determine which extensions to scan for but they must be using some. Curious what the complete JSON object looks
      like? <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/files/linkedin-extension.json" target="_blank">Here's mine</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to the console as a javascript object.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>After examing the JSON file it became pretty clear what was going on. LinkedIn is using two different methods to determine if
      you have an extension installed.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Content Changed</li>
        <li>Web Accessible Resources</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first method is the simplest. LinkedIn simply looks for certain content on the page they know doesn't belong there. For
      instance, if they find a div with the ID <strong>email-hunter</strong>, they know you have the Email Hunter extension installed
      (and now your account is probably restricted, or at least on a blacklist).</p>
      <p>The second method is a lot more interesting to me. When building an extension you can specify web accessible resources. These
      resources are typically used via a content script to build a custom interface. However, there's a bit of a gotcha. If the content
      script can make a request for the web accessible resource, so can the underlying website. LinkedIn abuses this fact and sprays
      web requests to your local browser in attempt to find extensions.</p>
      <p>I built a simple extension to automatically parse the extension file and display extensions LinkedIn is looking for.
        <a href="https://code.prophitt.me/corey/nefarious-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out here</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>So, as a developer of an extension what can you do about this? I recommend not using
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/web_accessible_resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web accessible resources</a>. Out
      of all extensions LinkedIn finds, a majority of them are due to web accessible resources.</p>
      <p>I would recommend not modifying or injecting user interface features into the underlying page. Alternatively, I would use a
      browser action and communicate with the content page through messaging passing.</p>

    </span></p><p>“I think you need to read more,” my professor told me bluntly. I’d just shared my idea for an upcoming paper, and he clearly wasn’t thrilled about it.</p><p>“Read more?” I remember thinking. I wasn’t expecting that response. I walked out of his university office trying to make sense of his comment.</p><p>So I read a lot over the next few weeks. My knowledge grew tremendously—and so did my ideas, which inspired a new and improved paper topic.</p><p>That experience, which was about a decade ago, taught me a critical lesson: the benefits of reading avidly and broadly about your field. What began as a one-time thing to do well in a class has turned into a lifetime habit.</p><p>Interestingly, I received similar advice when I began writing professionally. I was constantly told to write a lot and <em>read a lot</em>.</p><p>Given the emphasis on reading up to that point, you can imagine my shock at the attitude toward reading when I began to program. It seems to be a low priority for many people.</p><p>In the world of programming, reading includes reading code and reading technical books. I’ve written previously on <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-reading-code-matters">why reading code matters</a> and how to go about it.</p><p>Now it’s time to tackle reading technical programming books.</p><p>Reading technical programming books is one <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/3-programming-habits-to-build-now">habit programmers should begin immediately</a>. It’s a relatively small investment that’ll help you now, but will pay dividends in the future for this simple reason: your knowledge will compound over time.</p><p>The question you’re probably asking is this: why books?</p><p>After all, we spend a bulk of our days glued to the computer, where we have access to a seemingly infinite amount of material (and so much of it is free).</p><p>As a producer of online content, I realize that online articles and blog posts have their place. Blog posts can give you an interesting perspective and exposure to a new idea. A technical article or the documentation for a language or technology can answer that specific question you have.</p><p>But books have their place, too.</p><p>They fill a different need: they’re a source of long-form content that take you on an in-depth journey about a particular topic. A blog post or technical article may be a few hundred or thousand words. A book is tens of thousands.</p><p>When you pick up a technical book, you take a deep dive into said topic. You pick up the nuances. You study, practice, and learn. You get into the mindset of an industry expert. You begin to see things differently, as your context begins to grow.</p><p>There’s no shortage of topics to read about in our field:</p><ul><li>Computer architecture</li><li>Agile software development</li><li>Algorithms</li><li>Testing</li><li>Writing clean code</li><li>Refactoring</li></ul><p>The list goes on and on.</p><p>Even in the age of everything digital, it pays to begin your own library of technical material. So invest in some technical books. Use them. Write in them. Reference them as you code to help you build good habits.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is finding the time to fit something like reading into an already packed schedule.</p><p>But if people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett—who are known to be vast readers—can find time to read, I’m convinced we can, too.</p><p>Consider mathematician Richard Hamming. He, too, figured out a way to make reading a habit, which he shares in his excellent lecture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=a1zDuOPkMSw"><em>You and Your Research</em></a>.</p><p>Hamming couldn’t understand how his colleague, mathematician John Tukey, knew so much. “The guy was clearly a genius,” Hamming recalls. So he went into his manager’s office to find out.</p><p>“Hamming,” his manager said matter of factly, “you’d be surprised how much you’d know if you worked as hard as <!-- -->[Tukey]<!-- --> did.”</p><p>Hamming reflected on his manager’s comment and decided to “reorganize” his life. He cut out “nonsense magazines” and spent time “studying things in <!-- -->[his]<!-- --> career.”</p><p>There was always a book on his coffee table “ready to be read.” He also got appointed as a book review editor, so he could review the books he read. “This way I forced myself to get a wide acquaintance in computer science,” Hamming remarked of the process.</p><p>“I wasn’t a first-class genius,” Hamming explained. “So I simply set aside those other things <!-- -->[like reading the New Yorker]<!-- --> and did that,” he added. “It’s not hard to do. You just do it.”</p><h2>What We can Learn from Hamming</h2><p>There are a few critical points we can glean from Hamming’s story.</p><p>First, he always had a book on his coffee table. In other words, he always had a book in sight. This visual sends a kind reminder to read.</p><p>If a coffee table doesn’t work for you, try keeping a programming book next to your computer or nightstand. Perhaps placing a book by your television stand is best. That way, when you reach for the remote control, you see the book you ought to be reading.</p><p>Second, becoming a book editor seemed to hold Hamming accountable both for reading and for making sense of what he read.</p><p>After writing a review, he let it sit for a week. Then, he’d ask himself these questions: “Is that a good review? Does that really digest the book?” If not, “you’re re-reading the book and writing a better review.”</p><p>In today’s world, the process is even easier: read a book and write a blog post on it. Indeed, writing is a great way to solidify your knowledge.</p><p>That's an important point: do something with the content you're reading about. Hamming chose to write reviews. But there are other ways to go about it.</p><p>While reading, use what I call the “<a href="https://amymhaddad.com/four-ways-to-learn-programming-topics">spot check</a>” approach. The idea is to randomly check your knowledge as you learn new material. After reading a paragraph or two, pause, and see if you can recall and articulate what you just learned about.</p><p>Another idea is to type some notes summarizing key points after you read a chapter. The process itself is useful to review and reinforce important points.</p><p>Then, you can use the notes you type in different ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Make <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/how-to-retain-the-programming-knowledge-you-have-gained">Anki flashcards</a></strong>, so you’ll constantly see the information in the future.</li><li><strong>Make a checklist</strong>. After getting feedback on my variable names, I read about naming in the book <em>Code Complete</em>. Then, I made a “<a href="https://amymhaddad.com/improve-your-code-by-writing-better-variable-names.mdx">variable name” checklist</a>. It hangs on the wall in front of my desk.</li><li><strong>Focus on something specific you learned about while coding</strong>. I recently read some useful information about writing tests. Now I pull up these notes and reference them as I work.</li></ul><p>The point is to apply what you’re learning. Take the information you're gaining, connect it, and turn it into knowledge.</p><p>In large part, making reading a priority is a matter of attitude.</p><p>You’ve got to realize that reading matters. And to realize that reading matters, you’ve got to see the benefits. When something is important and we see the benefits, we find a way to make it happen.</p><p>There’s an easy way to do it: start with reading only 30 minutes each day for a month. It’s a small, manageable investment of time. And yet it’s enough to have an impact.</p><p>Whenever I add something new to my life, I find it useful to cut out something else. That way, I don’t add more stress trying to fit it all in.</p><p>At the end of the month, take inventory and see how much you learned. The odds are high that you’ll be shocked by how much you learn. You’ll either find ways to continue the habit or you’ll find ways to spend even more time reading.</p><p>The professor who told me to “read more” ignited my motivation to read, albeit initially to get a good grade. But I quickly saw the benefits. As it turned out, this professor, who I later learned has over 1,000 books in his personal library, gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever received.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic stuff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes users often rely on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and cluster autoscaling to scale applications. We show how using Red Sky Ops to optimize the whole application alongside the HPA improves cost and performance using the example of a web-application.</p>





<h2><strong>What is the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler?</strong></h2>





<p>The<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> (HPA) in Kubernetes scales up and down the number of replicas in a deployment or a stateful set based on metrics prescribed by the user. The most common metrics are CPU and memory utilization of the target pods.&nbsp;</p>





<p>To deploy the HPA, the user sets target metrics for all replicas in a deployment as well as the minimum and maximum number of replicas. The HPA is responsible for adding or deleting replicas to keep the observed metrics lower than the target values while keeping the number of replicas within the prescribed bounds.</p>





<p>When scaling based on CPU and memory utilization, HPA uses the metrics.k8s.io API implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metrics-server</a>. The HPA can also use<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> custom metrics</a> or external metrics (e.g. number of requests per second on the ingress) implemented by a third-party or the user.</p>





<h2><strong>HPA tuning challenges</strong></h2>





<p>Optimizing the target metrics of the HPA for all applications and their specific workloads can be frustrating. While newer versions of kubernetes support more in depth configuration of the HPA through policies<a href="#note">*</a>, many users are left with a minimal set of configuration options: namely a cpu/memory utilization target and the maximum number of replicas.</p>





<p>If the application is a web server for example, the speed at which the HPA adds replicas is critical to accommodate bursts in traffic. A simple fix would be to reduce the CPU utilization target to a small value (say 15%) so that the HPA adds replicas early on when the traffic increases. However, this increases your cloud cost because many replicas are underutilized. To limit the cost, one could use replicas with a high CPU utilization target. If the traffic increases, while the HPA is creating replicas waiting to be available, the current replicas experience CPU throttling and the HTTP request latency increases, impacting the clients experience.</p>





<p>A ML-powered experimentation engine such as <a href="https://github.com/redskyops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Sky Ops</a> can be used to design a highly available, scalable and cost-efficient application. Let’s demonstrate this using an example web application.</p>





<h2><strong>Example web application</strong></h2>





<p>In the following example, we will optimize the <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker example voting app</a> using Red Sky Ops. This app is a simple distributed application that allows the user to vote between two options – cats or dogs.</p>





<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FbR98IC_2s4U7qpocG4wyH_iAWd8k9aAwai5OTLYvDezvic2HrNZLbqfI-9ABGgoR6RPJxESclSW5oYGyF3m-s6tfS3ByaensHUNlUIMLaIJ69-znggPRpL2WAYxHX4fkGYAlUQ" alt=""></figure>





<p>A Redis queue collects the votes. Workers consume the votes and insert them in a postgres database. Finally there is a node.js webapp that shows the results of the voting in real time. You can deploy this application in a dedicated namespace with:</p>





<pre>kustomize build github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/voting-webapp/application | kubectl apply -f -</pre>





<h2><strong>Red Sky Ops experiments</strong></h2>





<p>An “experiment” is made of multiple trials whereby the Red Sky Ops server patches the whole application to find the optimal configuration. For each trial, the application is tested using a scalability test. At the end of each test, the Red Sky Ops controller measures metrics to optimize for. In this experiment, we will optimize for two metrics of opposite goals: cost of running the application (in $/month) and p95 latency (in ms). While the performance increases with resources, cost becomes problematic. On the other hand, starving an application reduces user experience. Machine learning helps finding the best tradeoff. You can find detailed instructions to run the experiment yourself <a href="https://github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/tree/master/hpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> with Locust.</p>





<p>We are using the HPA to scale up and down the number of replicas of the front-end deployment responsible for the user experience. For simplicity, we will tune HPA using a target utilization available via the metrics server. The parameters that we are optimizing are the minimum and maximum number of replicas, target utilization used by the HPA and CPU requests for the voting-service pod. Note that every pod runs with a guaranteed QoS (limits=requests).</p>





<p>We run the experiment for 400 trials, and consider a trial as failed if the response latency is greater than one second.</p>





<h2><strong>Scalability test</strong></h2>





<p>During each trial we load test the application with increasing requests per second (RPS): 100 RPS for one minute, 500 RPS for one minute, 1000 RPS for one minute, 2000 for one minute. This allows us to test the scalability of the application and make sure that the HPA is configured correctly. The application should be able to minimize the cost for a low level of traffic (100 RPS) but still able to scale up fast enough to 2000 RPS.</p>





<h2><strong>Experiment results</strong></h2>





<p>We first set a baseline configuration with:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=7<br>CPU utilization target=65%<br>CPU per replica=2&nbsp;</pre>





<p>In this case the cost is $481/month to run this application for a p95 latency of 579 milliseconds.</p>





<p>Each dot represents the metric values measured at the end of each trial (<a href="#figure-1">see Figure 1</a>). The red dots are the best trials found during the experiment, i.e. there is no better configuration for one metric without increasing the value of the other metric. After some exploration of the parameter space, the algorithm converges towards optimal configurations. We find a sharp transition in latency around a cost of $330 per month, where the most satisfying performance is achieved. We find that the best application is obtained for:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=10<br>Maximum replicas=15<br>CPU utilization target=80%<br>CPU per replica=0.855</pre>





<p>The cost of running this application is $365/month (24% savings) while the latency is 27.8 milliseconds (95% increase in performance). The advantage of providing multiple best configurations is the ability for the user to pick based on experience. For example, if an experienced devops engineer wants a more scalable application in case of larger spikes of traffic than the ones created for the load test, the following configuration can be chosen:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=9<br>CPU utilization target=10%<br>CPU per replica=0.849</pre>





<p>The cost is $344/month (28% savings) while the latency is 60 milliseconds (89% increase in performance). Because the CPU utilization target per replica is lower in this case, a sudden burst in traffic triggers a scale up from the HPA early allowing for the newly added replicas to be available.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Red Sky Ops experiment results</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>





<p>Using Red Sky Ops, we can deploy a web application using the HPA that efficiently scales and avoids over provisioning for spikes in traffic.</p>





<p>We decided to tune the CPU target utilization of the HPA. This is more of an infrastructure monitoring approach that is made available quite easily by the metrics server. A different approach would have been to tune the HPA based on the number of requests-per-second on the ingress. Check out this great<a href="https://medium.com/uptime-99/kubernetes-hpa-autoscaling-with-custom-and-external-metrics-da7f41ff7846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> blog post</a> on how to set up the external metrics server to work with the HPA.</p>





<p>Like the<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> USE</a> and <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/the-red-method-key-metrics-for-microservices-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RED</a> methods for monitoring your infrastructure and user experience, the Red Sky Ops experiments can be written to optimize both of your infrastructure cost and usage and/or user experience on your deployed application.</p>





<p>Finally, Red Sky Ops allows you to efficiently find the optimal configurations when the correlations are<a href="https://www.carbonrelay.com/blog/the-new-basics-of-configuration-management-in-kubernetes/"> too complicated for a human to understand</a>. For this example, we have oversimplified the application to easily interpret the results, but in production one would tune the resources of all the deployments.</p>

				<p>After <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">adopting an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you face two new challenges: finding improperly tagged AWS resources and enforcing your tagging strategy going forward. In <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices-guide-part-2/" target="_blank">the previous installment</a> of this guide, you saw how to enforce your AWS tagging strategy when creating new resources with Terraform or CloudFormation. In this part, you’ll see how to find improperly tagged AWS resources.</p>

<p>Tagging your resources in AWS will help prevent misuse and maintain your infrastructure. When combined with a tool like <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/?utm_source=blog" target="_blank">CloudForecast</a>, tagging your resources can help you predict and control your monthly spending, so it’s usually worthwhile to invest in tag maintenance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s easy for AWS tags to get out of date. If you’re <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">adopting a new tagging strategy</a>, you likely have a lot of catching up to do, but even if you’ve been following one for years, things can get stale. Your team may want to change the name of a tag or update the rules surrounding certain tags. Developers may leave without handing off resources they managed, or someone might forget to change an outdated tag on an AWS resource. Even the best AWS tagging policy will require ongoing maintenance, especially as the number of resources you manage grows.</p>

<p>To help maintain your AWS tags, you should regularly audit them to make sure they’re still accurate. At a small company, it might be possible to do these audits manually, but you’ll need to use tools to help you automate the process as you grow. This article will show you six tools you can use to help find and fix outdated AWS tags. You’ll see some of the use cases for each so you can decide which ones are best for your organization. I’ll do a deep dive into the first two because they’re the most commonly used today, but it’s a good idea to have a few options to choose from.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cloud Custodian</li>
  <li>AWS Config Rules</li>
  <li>Retro Tag</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="cloud-custodian">Cloud Custodian</h2>

<p><a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/" target="_blank">Cloud Custodian</a> is an open-source collection of scripts that help developers manage their public cloud accounts. For this article, I’ll limit my focus to Cloud Custodian’s tag maintenance features in AWS, but it supports <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/examples/index.html" target="_blank">a variety of use cases</a> and most of the major cloud hosting providers.</p>

<p>One use case for Cloud Custodian is to find AWS resources that don’t comply with your tagging policy. Let’s say you have an application consisting of an elastic load balancer and three EC2 instances like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uLKRhFH.png" alt="The desired state of AWS tags in the demo architecture"></p>

<p>And you want all your EC2 instances to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an <code>env</code> tag with a value.</li>
  <li>Have a <code>contact</code> tag with either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code> as the value.</li>
  <li>Have a <code>service</code> tag with either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code> as the value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud Custodian’s policies are stored in <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/policyStructure.html" target="_blank">YAML files</a> so there’s no state to maintain outside of the policy itself. To create a policy that will tell you if any of your EC2 instances aren’t in compliance with the above rules, create a new policy file called <code>policy.yml</code>:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can run Cloud Custodian from your local machine or <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/cron-job" target="_blank">set up a cron job</a> to run it from a server on a recurring basis. <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/index.html#install-cc" target="_blank">Once installed</a>, run the above Cloud Custodian policy from your command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>custodian run <span>-s</span> ./ policy.yml
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cloud Custodian will output a “count” of the number of EC2 instances that are missing one of your required tags and generate a report in your output folder (<code>./</code> in this case) that includes more details about the resources so you can remedy their tags.</p>

<p>Cloud Custodian can also <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/actions.html" target="_blank">perform actions</a> to remediate or alert you to issues automatically. For example, you may want to call a webhook that triggers a notification when an EC2 instance doesn’t adhere to your tagging policy.</p>

<p>To add a webhook action, replace your <code>policy.yml</code> file with the following:</p>

       <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://example.com/hooks?id=1</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run Cloud Custodian, it will call <code>https://example.com/hooks?id=1</code> if any EC2 instances fail to adhere to your policy. There are <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/examples/tagcompliance.html" target="_blank">many examples in their docs</a> for using filters and actions to perform other tasks. While running Cloud Custodian locally from your command line is a good way to test your configuration, you should ultimately <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/deployment.html" target="_blank">deploy your policies to a server</a> to run them against your production environment on a schedule. You can even deploy Cloud Custodian policies as a periodic <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/policy/lambda.html" target="_blank">Lambda function</a> to help minimize the cost.</p>

<h2 id="aws-config-rules">AWS Config Rules</h2>

<p>Amazon’s official tool for auditing your resources is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" target="_blank">AWS Config</a>. Like Cloud Custodian, it can be used to check a range of compliance and configuration settings, but I’ll focus on its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/required-tags.html" target="_blank">managed rules for requiring tags</a>.</p>

<p>Using AWS Config, you can specify which resources should have tags and the expected values for each tag. AWS Config allows you to run remediation steps when a violation is found so that your team can quickly fix tagging mistakes, but it doesn’t prevent you from creating resources with improper tags. For that, you’ll have to go back to <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices-guide-part-2/" target="_blank">the previous installment of this guide</a>.</p>

<p>To reproduce the Cloud Custodian policy above, go to <strong>AWS Config &gt; Rules &gt; Add rule</strong>. Enter “required-tags” in the search bar and select the required tags rule.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9EvLGJ.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 1"></p>

<p>Name the rule, add a description, and select the resources you want this rule to apply to. In this case, enter <code>EC2: Instance</code> only if you just want to make sure your EC2 instances are correctly tagged.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I313Xf2.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 2"></p>

<p>Next, enter the tags and allowed values that you want to enforce. To replicate the Cloud Custodian policy above, set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>tag1Key</code> = <code>env</code> with a blank value</li>
  <li><code>tag2Key</code> = <code>contact</code> and <code>tag2Value</code> = <code>j-mark,l-duke</code></li>
  <li><code>tag3Key</code> = <code>service</code> and <code>tag3Value</code> = <code>cart,search</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zo50csf.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 3"></p>

<p>Skip the remediation details for now and click “Save.” You’ll be taken back to the list of AWS Config Rules. The initial check will take a few minutes to run, so wait a bit then refresh the page. AWS Config will show you a list of which resources are in compliance and which are not. Be aware that AWS Config <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=192627" target="_blank">can take up to 6 hours to reindex your tags</a> after they’ve been changed on your resources.</p>

<p>If you want to call a webhook like you did for Cloud Custodian above, you will need to create an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html" target="_blank">SNS topic that calls a webhook</a>. After creating the topic, edit the rule and select <code>AWS-PublishSNSNotification</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6LsSOOw.png" alt="Adding remediation to an AWS Config Rule, step 1"></p>

<p>Add an IAM Role ARN with SNS access to the <code>AutomationAssumeRole</code> field, add a message, and paste the <code>TopicArn</code> from your SNS topic. This will allow AWS Config to trigger the SNS topic references when the config rule fails.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DYDXOVf.png" alt="Adding remediation to an AWS Config Rule, step 2"></p>

<p>Click “Save.” Now, when new EC2 instances are found that fail this compliance check, the SNS topic will call your webhook. This isn’t the only remediation step available, so read more about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/remediation.html" target="_blank">your remediation options in the AWS Config docs</a>.</p>

<p>While the AWS Config rules aren’t as powerful as Cloud Custodian’s, there are some advantages. It’s built into AWS and works with CloudFormation. This means there are fewer extra files to manage, and AWS Config provides a visual configuration timeline that will help you track down improper tagging practices.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O17fiEz.png" alt="AWS Config configuration timeline"></p>

<p>That said, <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2019/02/06/should_you_use_aws_config/" target="_blank">there are other problems with it</a> like its lack of support for some resources and cost. If you’re deciding between AWS Config and Cloud Custodian, you might want to do a deeper dive into each tool to determine which will work best for your team.</p>

<h2 id="retro-tag">Retro Tag</h2>

<p>Unlike the previous two tools, <a href="https://www.gorillastack.com/news/retro-tag-retroactively-tag-aws-resources/" target="_blank">Retro Tag</a> wasn’t built for finding untagged resources directly, but instead, it focuses on helping you track down the creator of every resource in your AWS account. This is an useful step in auditing your tags because the person who created the resource usually knows the most about it. Once you find the creator, you can ask them how the resource is being used (if at all) and put them in charge of fixing the tags.</p>

<p>Retro Tag is open-source and built on the <a href="https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag" target="_blank">Auto Tag</a> engine by GorillaStack. It works by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/" target="_blank">AWS Athena</a> to export a CSV of your relevant <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" target="_blank">CloudTrail events</a>. The Retro Tag script uses this CSV to tag any resources that still exist and don’t yet have an <code>AutoTag_Creator</code> or <code>AutoTag_CreateTime</code> tag.</p>

<p>If you’re using <a href="https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag" target="_blank">Auto Tag</a> to add creator tags to all new resources, Retro Tag is a great way to catch up on resources that were created before Auto Tag was installed. That said, you don’t have to run both of them together. You may just want to add creator tags to old resources so you can assign responsibility for updating tags to the creator rather than doing it yourself.</p>

<h2 id="gold-fig">Gold Fig</h2>

<p>While Cloud Custodian and AWS Config audit your resources on the fly, <a href="https://github.com/goldfiglabs/goldfig" target="_blank">Gold Fig</a> takes a different approach to the problem. It loads all your AWS resource data into a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgres database</a> and gives you a command-line interface to run queries against it. Gold Fig is also open-source, so you can deploy it to your local machine or a server that automatically syncs the data regularly.</p>

<p>Gold Fig doesn’t offer remediation actions like Cloud Custodian, but developers familiar with SQL might find the query syntax more natural than learning another flavor of YAML. Because loading your data from AWS takes several minutes, it also isn’t ideal for tracking real-time updates to your resources. But, if you’d like to perform periodic audits on your resources using complex …</p></div></div>

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
― Arthur C. Clarke, Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since Raspberry Pi came into my world, I have been exploring better ways to interact with it. Take Kodi the media player for example - yes, keyboard and mouse are fine; yes, the native web interface is super powerful; and yes, you can even use your TV remote directly if it’s HDMI-CEC-compatible. But there’s something about Raspberry Pi’s small form factor (and perhaps its open source spirit) that just makes me wish for a hands-free experience.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like my Google Home Mini/Google Assistant to pick up my voice command, send it over to the Raspberry Pi and make it to do something useful. To my great surprise, there doesn’t seem to be a satisfactory end-to-end solution anywhere that suits my need. However, that’s about to change - please join me in my quest to build a voice-controlled Raspberry Pi. Before we dive into the technical mumbo jumbo, here is a quick rundown of all the hardware/software we need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/adnanh/webhook">Webhook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">Port forwarding</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/">FreeDNS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> (or any voice assistant that IFTTT supports for that matter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay Google, pause Kodi and let’s get started.</p>


<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the name, Kodi is an all-in-one solution for media consumption. For starter, it integrates almost every video streaming service on earth into a unified interface, be it YouTube, Netflix or even Google Drive. In addition to its core functionalities as a media player, Kodi supports extensions that can do much more through the installation of add-ons. Did I mention that it has a lovely weather widget?</p>

<p>Kodi also shines in the input department. On top of the keyboard/mouse, web interface or TV remote option, the <code>kodi-send</code> command lets user control the player via command line. For example, if we are interested in replicating the effect of pressing the play button, we only need to need to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To wrap it in a shell, let’s create the following script <code>/usr/local/bin/pictrl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>action</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"play"</span> <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"pause"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then
  </span>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it’s ready to roll. Since play and pause are basically the same command in different contexts, we also get the pause function for free.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use <code>pictrl play</code> in the command line interface (or over SSH) to play (or pasue) the video on your Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="webhook---listening-and-responding-to-a-web-request">Webhook - Listening and Responding to a Web Request</h2>

<p>Next up we are going to trigger that <code>pictrl</code> script with an http request. For that, we will use webhook, a cool piece of technology that enables responding to http requests with custom callbacks.</p>

<p>To enable webhook, first create the configuration file <code>/etc/webhook.conf</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"execute-command"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/usr/local/bin/pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"command-working-directory"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/home/pi/"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"pass-arguments-to-command"</span><span>:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"query"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"action"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>that points a new webhook instance to the <code>pictrl</code> command. After that, the webhook can be started as a service using:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or auto-started upon startup by running:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that for such a service that is intended to be accessible over the internet (as will become true in the next step), it’s probably a good idea to authenticate the identity of the requestor in some form. For example, you can ask the requestor to submit a token that only a trusted user knows along with the request itself.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://localipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device within the same network to control your Kodi player.</p>

<h2 id="port-forwarding---exposing-local-service-to-the-public">Port Forwarding - Exposing Local Service to the Public</h2>

<p>A local IP address, by definition, isn’t visible outside the local network. To fix the problem, it’s generally required to log on to your modem/router as admin and configure what’s known as port forwarding. From then on, instead of using <code>http://localipaddress:port</code> locally, we can call <code>http://publicipaddress:port</code> over the internet and the request will be directed to the same place.</p>

<p>In case you don’t have admin control over your modem (which is unfortunately true in my case), <a href="https://webhookrelay.com/">Webhook Relay</a> can be helpful although its free tier only supports up to 150 “relays” per month. Another service called <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> can be equally effective, with the catch being no permanent subdomain support for the free tier users. Other solutions include a dedicated VPN/VPS that allows for port forwarding. You see, they all cost money if you want the optimal experience.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://publicipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device that’s connected to the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-dns---your-raspberry-pis-permanent-domain-name">Dynamic DNS - Your Raspberry Pi’s Permanent Domain Name</h2>

<p>For most internet users at home, chances are that their public IP addresses aren’t static. With each reboot of the modem, a new address will be assigned by the ISP which makes it annoying if you are looking for a more permanent solution. Don’t worry - dynamic DNS services such as FreeDNS can come to the rescue. These services essentially maintain a list that maps the domain (or subdomain) names to their corresponding IP addresses, and each user tells them to update the list whenever the IP address changes. To automate this, run the following command at Raspberry Pi’s startup:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>wget https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?[yourtokenhere]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all goes well, instead of changing <code>http://publicipaddress</code> each time the modem restarts, a new and permanent name <code>http://domainname</code> is all we have to remember.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://domainname:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device on the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="ifttt---connecting-to-a-voice-assistant">IFTTT - Connecting to A Voice Assistant</h2>

<p>IFTTT, short for “If This Then That”, provides a convenient way to create a hub that connects a variety of services (including voice assistants) where they can interact with each another based on a set of user-defined rules (called applets). At the time of writing, IFTTT allows each user to create up to 3 applets for its free tier. As the name implies, every applet follows the “If This Then That” structure:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/1.jpg">
</p>

<p>and creating a new applet boils down to defining the two pieces: the “If This” and the “Then That”.</p>

<p>So let’s configure the “If This” first by selecting the Google Assistant option (you might be asked to link your Google account to IFTTT). In the next screen, although the “Say a simple phrase” option is more than enough to get the job done, the “Say a phrase with a text ingredient” option is preferred as it will be a lot more flexible when it comes to further customizing our voice commands.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/3.jpg">
</p>

<p>That brings us to the trigger configuration. Personally, I use “kodi” as my keyword, followed by a custom text field. The rest is not important.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/4.jpg">
</p>

<p>Next, onto the “Then That” piece, what we want to choose is the webhook service that we created in the previous step, with the exact action being configurable for future development’s sake:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/6.jpg">
</p>

<p>Save and continue. That’s it - our first IFTTT applet has just become fully operational.</p>

<p><strong>Final milestone</strong>: now you can say the following magic words to play (or pause) the video on your Raspberry Pi’s Kodi player:</p>



<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

<p><img src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/logo2.png">
</p>

<p>As you might have noticed by now, your voice can be literally as powerful as your computer is. The toolchain we’ve explored so far makes it possible to invoke almost any action of our choice with almost any words of our choice. What’s more, any additional development will only need to happen locally inside the <code>pictrl</code> dispatcher, so it’s easily scalable if we want our Raspberry Pi to learn a new trick. Last but not least, what to do with such limitless possibility might be a matter of user experience at the end of the day, so please let me know what your mileage turns out to be.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="install-all-the-software-packages-mentioned-above">Install all the software packages mentioned above</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi-eventclients-kodi-send
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Update Oct 22, 2020: Included discussion on other solutions when port forwarding is not an option. Thanks to Mike Foden (@mikefoden) for bringing up ngrok.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>One of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, LUMI, will start its operations in CSC’s data center in Kajaani, Finland, next year. The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s. To date, the world’s fastest computer, Fugaku in Japan, reaches peak performance of 513 petaflop/s. When LUMI’s operations start next year, it will be one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>LUMI is a unique European endeavor, with ten European countries and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) investing in one joint system. It is set to boost research, employment, and competitiveness throughout Europe. The procurement process of LUMI is now complete, and the system supplier is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), providing an HPE Cray EX supercomputer with next generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. In addition to the remarkable computing power, LUMI is also one of the world’s most advanced platforms for artificial intelligence and it will be one of the world’s best known scientific instruments throughout its lifetime.</p>
<p>– Today we mark an important step forward in the realisation of the European High-Performance Computing strategy. The pre-exascale supercomputer hosted by the LUMI consortium will be among the top 5 in the world. Together with the other EuroHPC pre-exascale and petascale supercomputers that will be deployed in 2021, the LUMI supercomputer will help Europe’s public and private users address many daunting research and innovation problems across different areas from weather and climate change through cybersecurity to drug discovery and personalised medicine. LUMI supercomputer aligns the Digital and Green Deal policies of the European Commission, using 100% renewable carbon neutral energy. Moreover, the heat generated will provide 20 percent of the district heat of the area, being one of the most efficient supercomputers in the world, says <strong>Khalil Rouhana</strong>, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the European Commission.</p>
<p>– Once operational in mid-2021, the LUMI supercomputer will be one of the most competitive and green supercomputers in the world! Such a leadership-class system will support European researchers, industry, and public sector, in better understanding and responding to complex challenges and transforming them into innovation opportunities in sectors like health, weather forecasting, or urban and rural planning, says the Executive Director of EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, <strong>Anders Dam Jensen</strong>.</p>
<p>– We are committed to supporting the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) to seize opportunities in next-generation supercomputing and bolster R&amp;D in science, advance innovation, and unlock economic growth. We are honored to continue collaborating with EuroHPC JU, and through our partnership with AMD, build one of the world’s fastest pre-exascale supercomputers for Europe.”, says <strong>Peter Ungaro</strong>, senior vice president, and general manager, high-performance computing (HPC) and mission critical solutions (MCS), HPE.</p>
<p>– The reliability of CSC and Finland made the European Commission and ten partner countries to invest in one pan-European high-performance computing and data management infrastructure in Finland. We have to keep up the excellent collaboration in order to maximize this investment to benefit society on a larger scale, says Permanent Secretary <strong>Anita Lehikoinen</strong> from Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland</p>
<p>LUMI is an investment of over 200 million euros, covering the whole lifecycle of the system. It will lift Europe to the forefront of high performance computing (HPC) and research. Exploiting the potential of the data economy is crucial for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>– The investment will make CSC data center one of the world’s largest players in the field of HPC. The joint procurement process with the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and ten European countries has proceeded on schedule despite the global pandemic, thanks to the vast know-how of the LUMI consortium and the excellent collaboration. LUMI’s astonishing computing power combined with a highly modern artificial intelligence platform and data management infrastructure will help European researchers tackle unforeseen research challenges, says CSC’s Managing Director <strong>Kimmo Koski</strong>.</p>
<p>The uptake of HPC will remarkably increase the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe remarkably. Up to one-fifth of LUMI’s resources will be available for industry and SMEs.</p>
<p>– The technology we are using is strongly based on mathematical modelling: analyses, artificial intelligence, simulations, and optimization. Therefore, powerful computing capacity and data management infrastructure are of the utmost importance for us. The LUMI infrastructure will open up entirely new possibilities for us, which we may exploit, says Anna-Maria Henell, CEO of Disior Ltd. Disior is a Finnish company developing software for analysing medical images in 3D.</p>

<p><span>Caption: This is how the LUMI data center will look like. Copyright: Synopsis Architects Ltd. and Geometria Architecture Ltd.</span></p>
<p><strong>Supercomputers enable the fight against pandemics and help resolve unforeseen research questions<br>
</strong>LUMI’s top-notch computing resources are needed in leading-edge research in a wide range of data- and computing-intensive fields. Examples include climate, pharmaceutical, and artificial intelligence.<br>
LUMI will also have a fast-track for urgent computing in time- and mission-critical simulations. This kind of simulation might be, for example, related to a large epidemic or pandemic disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic has largely benefitted from supercomputers: supercomputers have been used for example to simulate studies related to vaccine research and defeat the spread of the virus. With its vast computing resources, LUMI can address different research challenges even faster than before. In addition, it will enable addressing totally new types of scientific challenges combining multidisciplinary research and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>World-class environmental sustainability and energy-efficiency</strong><br>
As a carbon-neutral data center, LUMI helps the European ICT sector in becoming greener and more cost-efficient, which is a necessity for reaching EU’s ambitious climate targets and paving the way for the green transition. CSC’s data center in Kajaani is among the world’s most eco-efficient: it uses 100% renewable energy produced with hydropower. LUMI’s waste heat will be used in Kajaani’s district heating network: 20% of the area’s yearly district heating needs will be covered with LUMI’s waste heat.</p>
<p><strong>LUMI system architecture explained:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The LUMI system will be supplied by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), based on an HPE Cray EX supercomputer.</li>
<li>The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s meaning 552 *10<sup>15</sup> floating point operations per second. This figure makes LUMI one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. For comparison, the world’s fastest computer today (Fugaku in Japan) reaches 513 petaflop/s and the second fastest (Summit in the US) 200 petaflop/s (more information: <a href="http://www.top500.org/">www.top500.org</a>). If LUMI’s computing power was compared to normal laptops, it would require 1.5 million laptops together to reach the performance of LUMI. If these laptops were piled up, they would form a tower of over 23 kilometers high!</li>
<li>LUMI will also be one of the most advanced platforms in the world for artificial intelligence (AI). With LUMI, it will be possible to combine AI, especially deep learning, and traditional large scale simulations combined with massive scale data analytics in solving one research problem.</li>
<li>The number crunching capability of LUMI is accelerated by the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) partition. It is based on the future generation AMD Instinct™ GPU.</li>
<li>LUMI will be complemented by a CPU (Central Processing Unit) partition, featuring 64-core next-generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs.</li>
<li>LUMI’s data analytics partition has 32 aggregated terabytes of memory and 64 visualization GPUs. This partition is used e.g. for visualization, heavy data analysis, meshing, and pre/post-processing.</li>
<li>LUMI’s storage system will consist of three components. First, there will be a 7-petabyte partition of ultra-fast flash storage, combined with a more traditional 80-petabyte capacity storage, both based on the Lustre parallel filesystem, as well as a data management service, based on Ceph and being 30 petabytes in volume.</li>
<li>In total, LUMI will have astounding storage of 117 petabytes and an impressive aggregated I/O bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second</li>
<li>LUMI will also have an OpenShift/Kubernetes container cloud platform for running microservices.</li>
<li>All the different compute and storage partitions are connected to the very fast Cray Slingshot interconnect of 200 Gbit/s. The global bandwidth of the LUMI-GPU partition is 160 TB/s. The global Internet traffic would fit therein, in fact, two times!</li>
<li>LUMI takes over 150m2 of space, which is about the size of a tennis court. The weight of the system is nearly 150 000 kilograms (150 metric tons).</li>

              <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is a popular messaging app. It is well-known for its security and efficiency. Apart from being able to send messages to each other, its users can also create bots to automate certain routine tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this tutorial, we will use Telegram's <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">bot API</a> to create a news bot using
              <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews API</a>. We will use Python programming language, as it provides convenient abstractions over the bot API.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
             We will use python-telegram-bot wrapper around the official API. This library significantly simplifies the job of the programmer when writing a bot. It is always easier to learn something new by reading through a couple of examples. Here is one:
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler


USAGE = '/greet &lt;name&gt; - Greet me!'


def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')


def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# on different commands - answer in Telegram 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start)) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command)) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# Start the Bot 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling() 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle() 


if __name__ == '__main__': 
&nbsp;&nbsp;main()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This small piece of code creates a bot that recognizes two commands:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>/start</span> - the bot will respond with the help page to this one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>/greet</span> - this command receives an argument (e.g. Datanews) and responds with <span>Hello Datanews!</span>.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let's go through each line in detail and discuss what this code does.</p>

            <p>We start with the <span>main</span> function:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher

&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))

&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling()
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This function sets up all the necessary machinery needed for our bot to work. Particularly, it creates an instance of the Updater class. Note that you need a Telegram token to be able to use Telegram bot API. Check out the official guide on how to create bots
              <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back to the code! The purpose of the <span>Updater</span> is to deliver updates (e.g. messages sent by users) to <span>Dispatcher</span>. When the latter receives an update, it tries to dispatch some of the user-specified callbacks to handle it. Each of those callbacks is managed by some handler.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can think of a handler as a function to handle an update that is only executed when some condition is met. The condition in question, though, depends on the handler and can be specified by the programmer. In our case, we have two instances of <span>CommandHandler</span> class.
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of them handles a particular command, supported by our bot - <span>/start</span> and <span>/greet</span> respectively.</p>

            <p>Then we call <span>start_polling</span> method.</p>

            

            <p>This will make our bot periodically fetch updates from the Telegram server. This method will internally create two threads: one will poll updates from the Telegram server, the other one will be used by the dispatcher to handle those updates.</p>

            <p>The next line makes sure our bot correctly handles various interruption signals (e.g. <span>SIGINT</span>).</p>

            

            <p>This is required when we want our bot to have persistent state. You can learn more about it and other cool library features in their
              <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now discuss two callback functions that handle bot's commands:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of these functions takes two arguments:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>update</span> - an update received by our bot from Telegram servers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>context</span> - contains various useful methods and information. For example, it has user_data dictionary which can store various user-related information.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, each of these methods sends a text message back to the user.</p>
            
            <p>You can check out more elaborate examples of Telegram bots in the library's official <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot">repo</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now move on to the main topic of our discussion.</p>

            <h2>
              Datanews API overview
            </h2>

            <p><a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> provides API for retrieving and monitoring news from more than a thousand different newspapers, news aggregators and other websites. We collect and process more than 100k news articles a day. Naturally, we provide a flexible and easy-to-use API for querying those articles. For our small project, though, we only need a small part of that API. Particularly, we want our bot to be able to:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Retrieve articles based on a query string, sent by the user.</li>
              <li>Retrieve articles from some particular publisher.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              These use-cases can be handled by a single end-point - /headlines. You can learn more about the provided API in the
              <a href="https://datanews.io/docs">official documentation</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Now we can go straight to the implementation of our bot.</p>
          </div>
        </div> <!-- / .row -->
      </div> <!-- / .container -->
    </section>

        <!-- SECTION
    ================================================== -->

          <div>

            <!-- Heading -->
            <h2>
              Implementation
            </h2>

            <p>First of all, let's define a callback that handles the <span>/start</span> command.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def get_usage():
&nbsp;&nbsp;return '''This bot allows you to query news articles from Datanews API.

Available commands:
/help, /start - show this help message.
/search &lt;query&gt; - retrieve news articles containing &lt;query&gt;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/search covid"
/publisher &lt;domain&gt; - retrieve newest articles by publisher.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/publisher techcrunch.com"'''

def help_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_markdown(get_usage())
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, the implementation closely resembles our bot example above - we simply return the help information to our user. You can notice that our bot will support four commands. The <span>help_command</span> function implements the first two of them. Let's now discuss the other two.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def search_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)


def publisher_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(source=query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>These functions look very similar. They both use the <span>/headlines</span> API endpoint as discussed earlier (we are using the official
              <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/datanews-python">Datanews library for Python here</a>). They both delegate their work to a helper <span>_fetch_data</span>. The only difference is in the arguments we pass to the Datanews API: <span>search_command</span> retrieves articles matching a certain query whereas <span>publisher_command</span> fetches all articles as long as they are published by a specific source. Note, however, that in both cases we only get the first 10 most recent articles.</p>

            <p>Let's now take a look at the helper that does all the job.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def _fetch_data(update, context, fetcher):
&nbsp;&nbsp;if not context.args:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help_command(update, context)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;query = '"' + ' '.join(context.args) + '"'
&nbsp;&nbsp;result = fetcher(query)

&nbsp;&nbsp;if not result['hits']:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text('No news is good news')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;last_message = update.message
&nbsp;&nbsp;for article in reversed(result['hits']):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text = article['title'] + ': ' + article['url']
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last_message = last_message.reply_text(text)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>This function simply checks that the user has indeed specified required arguments to the command, fetches the data from the Datanews API and sends it in reverse order to the user. A couple of comments here:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>We make sure to surround a query with <span>"</span> so that Datanews returns all articles containing the complete query and not just a single word from it. You can learn more about the query syntax in the
     …</li></ol></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>All around the world, companies are asking the same question: What is happening <em>right now</em>? We are inundated with pieces of data that have a fragment of the answer. But by the time we have assembled them into one clear view, the answer often no longer matters. It is too late.</p>
<p>Stateful stream processing is the way to beat the clock. It’s a programming paradigm that can materialize views of data in real time. What does that mean? It means you ask questions whose answers are incrementally updated as new information arrives. The effect is that your queries will always be fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://ksqldb.io/">ksqlDB</a>, the event streaming database, makes it easy to build real-time materialized views with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>. But how does it work? <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb/">Part 1</a> of this series looked at how stateless operations work. Now we will take a look at stateful ones. If you like, you can follow along by executing the example code yourself. <a href="https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html">ksqlDB’s quickstart</a> makes it easy to get up and running.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="materializing-a-view-from-a-stream"><a id="materializing-a-view-from-a-stream"></a>Materializing a view from a stream</h2>
<p>The goal of a materialized view is simple: Make a pre-aggregated, read-optimized version of your data so that queries do less work when they run. Imagine a toll-booth worker that collects fees from cars as they drive by. When the worker wants to know how much money is in the register, there are two different ways to find out. The worker can, of course, count every bill each time. But another way is to maintain a running total, by remembering the current amount, and periodically adding new driver fees.</p>
<p>When does this read-optimized version of your data get built? In a traditional database, you have to trigger it to happen. And when you do, the triggered updates can be slow because every change since the last trigger needs to be integrated. The materialized views might even need to be rebuilt from scratch, which can take a lot of time.</p>
<p>In stream processing, maintenance of the view is automatic and incremental. The view updates as soon as new events arrive and is adjusted in the smallest possible manner based on the delta rather than recomputed from scratch. That is why we say stream processing gives you <em>real-time</em> materialized views. It would be like the toll-worker adding to the running sum immediately after each driver’s fee is collected.</p>
<p>If you had a stream of sensor data:</p>
<pre><code>
CREATE STREAM readings (
    sensor VARCHAR KEY,
    area VARCHAR,
    reading INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'readings',
    partitions = 2,
    value_format = 'json'
);</code></pre>
<p>Whose events looked like:</p>
<pre><code>
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 45);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'motor', 41);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 92);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'engine', 13);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'engine', 90);

<p>You might want to frequently check the current average of each sensor. You can do that by materializing a view of the stream:</p>
<pre><code>
-- process from the beginning of each stream
SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';

CREATE TABLE avg_readings AS
    SELECT sensor,
           AVG(reading) AS avg
    FROM readings
    GROUP BY sensor
    EMIT CHANGES;</code></pre>
<p>What happens when you run this statement on ksqlDB? Its server (we’re just looking at a single node in this post—in a future one we’ll look at how this works when ksqlDB is clustered) creates a new persistent query that runs forever, processing data as it arrives. When each row is read from the <code>readings</code> stream, the persistent query does two things. First, it incrementally updates the materialized view to integrate the incoming row. Second, it emits a row to a <em>changelog</em> topic. The changelog is an audit trail of all updates made to the materialized view, which we’ll see is handy both functionally and architecturally. Here is what that process looks like:</p>

<p>Pause the animation at any point and note the relationship between the materialized view (yellow box) and the changelog, hovering over the rows in the changelog to see their contents. The current values in the materialized views are the <em>latest</em> values per key in the changelog. For example, notice how the first and third events in partition <code>0</code> of the changelog are for key <code>sensor-1</code>. The third event is a <em>refinement</em> of the first event—the reading changed from <code>45</code> to <code>68.5</code>. That refinement causes the average for <code>sensor-1</code> to be updated incrementally by factoring in only the new data</p>
<p>A materialized view is only as good as the queries it serves, and ksqlDB gives you two ways to do it: push and pull queries. Both are issued by client programs to bring materialized view data into applications. Pull queries retrieve results at a point in time (namely “now”). If you run a query such as <code>SELECT * FROM readings WHERE sensor='sensor-1';</code>, the result will be whatever is in the materialized view when it executes. You can explore what that pull query would return by sliding around the progress bar of the animation and inspecting the table below it. By contrast, push queries stream a subscription of query result changes of the query result to the client as they occur. If you run <code>SELECT * FROM readings WHERE sensor='sensor-1' EMIT CHANGES;</code>, each of the rows in the changelog with key <code>sensor-1</code> will be continuously streamed to your application (<code>45</code> and <code>68.5</code>, respectively, in this example).</p>
</div>
<p>Beyond the programming abstraction, what is actually going on under the hood? When ksqlDB begins executing the persistent query, it leverages RocksDB to store the materialized view locally on its disk. RocksDB is an embedded key/value store that runs in process in each ksqlDB server—you do not need to start, manage, or interact with it. RocksDB is used to store the materialized view because it takes care of all the details of storing and indexing an associative data structure on disk with high performance.</p>
<p>ksqlDB server creates one RocksDB instance <em>per partition</em> of its immediate input streams. This per-partition isolation is an architectural advantage when ksqlDB runs as a cluster, but it does have one important implication—all rows that you want to be aggregated together must reside on the same partition of the incoming stream. What happens if that isn’t the case?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="automatic-repartitioning"><a id="automatic-repartitioning"></a>Automatic repartitioning</h2>
<p>There are many clauses that a materialized view statement can be created with, but perhaps the most common is <code>GROUP BY</code>. In a relational database, <code>GROUP BY</code> buckets rows according to some criteria before an aggregation executes. If it is a distributed database, data may need to be moved between nodes so that the node executing the operation has all the data it needs locally. As in relational databases, so in ksqlDB. ksqlDB repartitions your streams to ensure that all rows that have the same key reside on the same partition. This happens invisibility through a second, automatic stage of computation:</p>

<p>In distributed systems, the process of reorganizing data locality is known as <em>shuffling</em>. Kafka Streams, ksqlDB’s underlying execution engine, uses Kafka topics to shuffle intermediate data. These implementation-level topics are usually named <code>*-repartition</code> and are created, managed, and purged on your behalf. Repartition topics for materialized views have the same number of partitions as their source topics. When records are shuffled across partitions, the overall order of data from each original partition is no longer guaranteed. This is important to consider when you initially load data into Kafka. In general, it is always wise to avoid a shuffle in any system if you can, since there is inherent I/O involved.</p>
<p>If your data is already partitioned according to the <code>GROUP BY</code> criteria, the repartitioning is skipped. This is one of the huge advantages of ksqlDB’s strong type system on top of Kafka. Optimizations can be inferred from the schema of your data, and unnecessary I/O can be transparently omitted. You don’t need to remember to do these things; they simply happen for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="replaying-from-changelogs"><a id="replaying-from-changelogs"></a>Replaying from changelogs</h2>
<p>The architecture described so far supports a myriad of materializations, but what happens when a hardware fault causes you to permanently lose the ksqlDB server node? RocksDB is an embedded key/value store. It has no replication support to create secondary copies over a network. In other words, RocksDB is treated as a transient resource. When you lose ksqlDB’s server, you also lose RocksDB. Is that a problem?</p>
<p>It turns out that it isn’t. Remember that every time a materialized view updates, the persistent query maintaining it also writes out a row to a changelog topic. Each row contains the value that the materialized view was updated to. When a fresh ksqlDB server comes online and is assigned a stateful task (like a <code>SUM()</code> aggregation query), it checks to see whether it has any relevant data in RocksDB for that materialized view. If it doesn’t, it <em>replays</em> the changelog data directly into its RocksDB store. When it reaches the end, its local materialized view is up to date, and it can begin serving queries.</p>

<p>The process is the same even if the server boots up and has some prior RocksDB data. When ksqlDB is run as a cluster, another server may have taken over in its place. A ksqlDB server coming online with stale data in RocksDB can simply replay the part of the changelog that is new, allowing it to rapidly recover to the current state.</p>
<p>People often ask where exactly a materialized view is stored. It is, in fact, stored in two places, each of which is optimized for a different usage pattern. It is stored once in RocksDB on ksqlDB’s server in its materialized form for fast access. …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>The <strong>multivariate gaussian</strong> is a crucial building block in machine learning, robotics, and mathematical finance applications. Here is just a small sample of applications.</p>

<li>Kalman Filters</li>
<li>Gaussian Mixture Models</li>
<li>Linear Discriminant Analysis</li>
<li>Linear Quadratic Regulators</li>
<li>Black Scholes Option Pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>However, probability density formula of a multivariate gaussian can be pretty intimidating.<br>

<p>While this expression may work for a mathematician, it can be a little overwhelming for other audiences. In this post I’ll provide an alternate rigorous, <em>programmatic</em>, definition of the multivariate gaussian in Python. We’ll then be able to use our mental Python interpreter to get intuition about the behavior of any multivariate gaussian.</p>
<p>I will assume familiarity with the following concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>single</em> dimensional gaussian, aka the normal random variable</li>
<li>expectation and covariance of random variables</li>
<li>vector and matrix operations, such as multiplication, and transpose</li>
<li>basic Python and numpy notation</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also need the concept of <em>simulation</em>. I’ll say that a function <em>f</em> simulates a random variable <em>F</em> if there is no way to determine, given a list of outputs, whether the list was generated by repeated function calls to <em>f</em> or whether it came from independent realizations of <em>F</em>.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready to give a computational definition of an <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional multivariate gaussian.  </p>
<p>Examine this simple program.</p>

<p>Now let’s break down what <code>x(mu, M)</code> does.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill an n-dimensional vector with independent standard random normals by calling <code>z()</code>.</li>
<li>Then multiply the result by matrix <code>M</code>.</li>
<li>Then shift the result by <code>mu</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This computational viewpoint is especially useful if <code>M</code> has a geometrical interpretation. For example, suppose we are working in two dimensions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If we graph the two columns of <code>M</code>, we can get a picture of how it warps the plane. </p>

<p>Successive calls to <code>z()</code> will generate a cloud of samples around the origin, with the cloud getting denser as we get closer to the origin. If we draw a circle around this cloud and multiply all points in the plane by <code>M</code>, we can see that we get a cloud in an elliptical shape.</p>

<p>This ellipsoid representation, by the way, is exactly what we use in the self driving car industry to represent the uncertainty estimates for the positions of other cars.</p>
<p>Suppose we know that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is simulated by <code>x(mu, M)</code> (and therefore it is, by our definition, multivariate gaussian) but we want to convert to the popular mean <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and covariance <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameterization. It’s a simple matter of computing statistics.</p>
<p>First let’s compute the mean.<br>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the mean <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <code>mu</code>. We could have guessed that by looking at the illustrations above.  </p>
<p>Now let’s compute the covariance. But first a clarification about notation. Consider that <code>np.matmul(z(), z().T)</code> calls <code>z</code> <em>twice</em> and therefore generates two independent versions of <code>z</code>. How do we declare that we want the <em>same</em> sample of <code>z</code> both times? We can use an immediately invoked <code>lambda</code> expression <code>(lambda Z: np.matmul(Z Z.T))(z())</code>. (You might have seen this elsewhere called the IIFE pattern.) Okay we’re ready to compute the covariance.</p>

<p><strong>Result 1.</strong> If <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a gaussian simulated by <code>x(mu, M)</code>, it has mean <code>mu</code> and covariance <code>M M.T</code>.</p>
<p>It’s actually more likely you’ll need to go <em>backwards.</em> For example, if you encounter a multivariate gaussian in the wild with the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameterization and you need want to visualize it as an ellipsoid using the <code>mu, M</code> parameterization. For that we usually use the <em>eigendecomposition</em> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><msup><mi>Q</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma = Q \Lambda Q^T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>This decomposition is extremely important in linear algebra, and I would encourage you to read up on it later. If we start with any covariance matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the eigendecomposition has the following properties.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a diagonal matrix with positive entries</li>
<li><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a high dimensional rotation matrix (all columns are mutually orthogonal)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to be working at a robotics company, you can do a code search for your gaussian visualization routines and I bet you will find something like the following.</p>

<p>The Hypi team is incredibly proud to announce today that we’re making our second <a href="https://hypi.app/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public beta available today</a>.</p>
<p>This has been in the making for a few months after receiving very valuable feedback from our community. Not only have we listened to the original feedback, some members of our community have directly contributed to the improvements in this release.</p>

<p>Three years ago our team set out to make it easier for developers to build applications but we had no idea of the amazing journey this would take us on. In our first 18 months we built 3 different versions and threw them all away because they just weren’t quite right. We spoke to developers at conferences and meetups including WebSummit, Collision and Apache Ignite London and France. It was 18 months researching and speaking to developers 6 countries face to face and 4 more virtually all of this has culminated into what Hypi is today.</p>

<p>Several months ago we offered limited access and got feedback from the wider community. That feedback was reassuring, almost everyone felt it was a good product with great potential but were missing a few things or could be improved here and there and now we’re again announcing Hypi, a comprehensive low-code backend as a service platform.</p>

<p>Hypi’s founding purpose is to make development simple and hair-loss free. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to do that best and we summised a few things from our own experience as well as from our research and speaking to developers.</p>
<ol><li>We spend too much time repeating ourselves from project to project, sometimes even within the same project. The things that almost everyone we spoke to say they repeat a lot are:<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/crud" target="_blank">CRUD APIs</a> – the bare bones of all data driven applications</li><li>Authentication – Registration and login in</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/authorisation" target="_blank">Authorisation</a> – Access control, even more than that, <strong>flexible</strong> access control. Role based access control is great but simply doesn’t fit the bill in many cases.</li><li>Caching and scaling – even today, this remains a challenge for most developers</li></ol></li><li>We spend so much time integrating and <a href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/api-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staying in sync with external services</a>.</li><li>We still have to build what are now commonplace features into our apps every time.</li></ol>
<p>The team’s very proud to say that Hypi takes care of all of these and so much more.</p>
<p>Available today are features such as:</p>
<ol><li>Instantly generating CRUD APIs from a data model</li><li>Automatically available login and registration APIs</li><li>A simple, yet flexible authorisation API allowing you to model anything from simple role based access control to complex corporate authorisation models</li><li>Hypi is built on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ignite.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Ignite</a> allowing us to automatically scale your APIs, no effort required. Taking advantage of its massively scalable in-memory technology we’re also able to achieve incredible performance, thinking nothing of it!</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/serverless-functions" target="_blank">Serverless functions</a> so you can add custom APIs and extend the built in ones.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/user-defined-functions" target="_blank">Inline functions</a> for when Docker containers are too heavy handed</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/webhooks" target="_blank">Webhooks</a> to accept incoming, unauthenticated events from external systems</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/workflow" target="_blank">Workflows</a> for scheduling and orchestrating function executions</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/math-api" target="_blank">Math APIs</a> for performing atomic mathematical operations server side</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/aggregations-api" target="_blank">Aggregations API</a> for getting analytics and other insights from your data</li><li>A powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/tutorials/arcql" target="_blank">query/filtering language</a> to find data</li><li>…and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/" target="_blank">so much more</a> </li></ol>
<p>When we say it’s a comprehensive platform, we mean it. For our existing users who have been working closely with us to get to this stage we thank you! This announcement signals our push towards general availability in the coming months. </p>
<p><a href="https://hypi.app/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up and let Hypi</a> take the stress and repetition out of back end development. Simple is best!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f99dfb0a1f04e2577108899ca48dca03f49f0d67/039b8/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/gardening-growing.jpg"></p><p>I’ve been using Twitter for almost 12 years now. It can be challenging to navigate your timeline, so today I’m sharing some tips to keep it fun.</p><p>This is the first part of my Twitter series about Gardening Your Twitter. Don’t miss out on the second part, where you can learn how to best <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/curating-your-twitter-timeline/">curate your timeline</a> and manage who to follow and unfollow.</p><h2 id="your-online-persona">Your Online Persona</h2><p>There are many strategies for online personas, but I can only share what works well for me. I follow people to cover specific areas/topics and also for their commentary/personality. In a way, Twitter is a newsfeed where the comments are presented before the content, and you pick people for both content and comments.</p><p>I’m known for talking about iOS and bootstrapping a company, and I have a pretty sharp tongue on tech news. I used to keep politics out of my feed, but since 2016, I do sprinkle in topics that are important to me — from US politics to climate change and LGBTQIA rights.</p><p>There will always be people who complain that XY topic shouldn’t be on Twitter, but in the end, it’s <em>your choice</em> what you talk about and it’s their choice to follow you.</p><p>I’m openly gay on Twitter, but only in the last few years have I also started talking about that. Being open does allow me to add a unique perspective to some content, and it adds more complexity to my persona. I almost never share pictures or private content though; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sportg33k/">that stuff is for Instagram</a>.</p><p>Whatever you go with, be authentic. I don’t share everything on Twitter, but what I do share is honest and is usually done with passion. Additionally, it can be interesting or funny. I do not share content for money or for favors, rather I only share things if I find them interesting.</p><h3 id="your-avatar">Your Avatar</h3><p>Pick an avatar you like and stick with it. I recommend a real face and not a sketch or something more abstract, as it’ll help folks identify you at conferences or events. Make sure you use the same picture and use it everywhere (GitHub, Gravatar, email, etc.) so that you have one universal online identity. People will scan the picture much faster than your name — changing it is usually something folks dislike, and it’ll result in a temporary loss of engagement. You can change it, but I recommend not doing that, or at least doing so only every few years.</p><p>Or, you can be really sneaky and just <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-your-profile-picture">remake your picture so it changes slightly every year</a>.</p><h3 id="direct-messages">Direct Messages</h3><p>I highly recommend going into Settings and privacy &gt; Privacy and safety &gt; Direct Messages and enabling “Receive messages from anyone.” There’s a lot of great commentary from people that I received via DM since they’re not comfortable replying publicly. There are the occasional odd messages (and inappropriate offers), but if you’re a cis white male, you likely are good. Minority groups might want to reconsider this setting or at least enable the Quality filter.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/863f9afff497ec9faee70ce7485680fbc999fde1/a1446/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/settings.png" alt="Twitter Settings"></p><p>If in doubt, I suggest you experiment with this — the settings are easy to change if it turns out to be a bad idea.</p><h3 id="multiple-profiles">Multiple Profiles</h3><p>Quite a few of my friends have “alt” accounts for the hot takes or for talking with friends. If you work at a Big Corp, you might be required to filter what you say, and having an alt can be a solution. In general, I don’t recommend making an alt account, as it’s simply too much work to maintain multiple accounts. Just tweet out your hot takes and attract the right followers on your main account.</p><h2 id="extending-reach">Extending Reach</h2><p>The more active followers you have on Twitter, the more fun it becomes. There’s no hack or shortcut for gaining followers, but there are various things you can do that can help you steadily grow your audience.</p><h3 id="blog-posts">Blog Posts</h3><p>Twitter is a great indicator for topics that people find interesting — <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1297956386836566016">I often get my best ideas for blog posts out of Twitter conversations</a>, and I also already have half the content there. Twitter is great for inspiration and to learn, but it’s often hard to read and follow conversations. Go the extra mile and convert some of these interactions to blog posts. This will greatly extend your reach, and in turn, it’ll attract new followers who find your content interesting.</p><h3 id="conference-talks">Conference Talks</h3><p><a href="https://steipete.tv/">Speaking at conferences</a> is a great way to meet new people and extend your social circle. I often meet folks at conferences, and either we connect on Twitter or we find out that we already know each other on there! Either way — this will increase the bond and will make it more likely that people reach out to you. <strong>Conferences are work, but they are so worth it.</strong></p><p>Bonus: <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/binary-frameworks-swift/">Convert your conference talk to a blog post</a>. Very few people will actually watch a recording, so via recycling and reshaping content you already have, you can extend your reach again.</p><p>If you plan on starting to speak, create a website where you list what topics you can talk about and your bio. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/steipete/speaking">a simple GitHub repo</a> that has been proven extremely useful for me to track past events, attract new speaking gigs, and help conference organizers with getting the information they need to announce me.</p><h3 id="engage-with-your-audience">Engage with Your Audience</h3><p>I try to reply to almost everyone who interacts with me on Twitter. This doesn’t take much time, and sometimes I just reply with an emoji, but taking time to engage shows your audience you care, and they’re much more likely to interact with your content again if they know that it’s not a one-way street. Same goes for your feed — don’t just read, reply. This can range from helping others with questions/problems to just posting a “me too” retweet. Sometimes I get content in my feed via a retweet, and by interacting with that, I get a new follower.</p><h3 id="tracking-statistics">Tracking Statistics</h3><p>Be consistent. You won’t grow an audience overnight. Make Twitter a daily thing. Share content. Be present — and you’ll grow your audience every day.</p><p><a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">Twitter Analytics</a> is great to understand which tweets work. To track long-term performance, I’m using <a href="http://birdbrainapp.com/">Birdbrain</a>. It’s one of the oldest apps on my phone, so I have data since 2014. Interestingly, my follower count has been growing pretty much linearly:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b753fb6d7ed16ff2e572edcc90d8143bf73653eb/38f85/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/follower.png" alt="Birdbrain Follower Count of @steipete" width="50%"></p><h2 id="tweets-that-work">Tweets that Work</h2><p>I do share a lot of news articles. I often just quote something interesting from the news if it doesn’t need strong commentary, but the inclusion of a pull quote helps show that it’s worth reading.</p><p>The tweets that are the most engaging, however, usually are original content, particularly in context with your audience and topics of interest. Here are some of my top performing tweets from the last few months, with about 80K–450K impressions each. Sometimes it’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1310331623729229827">ridiculous tweets that explode</a>, and sometimes you <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1306884214252613632?s=20">don’t need words</a>. It also can be news commentary if the comment <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1288151223028322304">really nails it</a> or just <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1281547449660825601">really fits</a>.</p><h3 id="using-threads">Using Threads</h3><p>Lately I’ve been using more and more threads to connect tweets over time — this has been proven to be really great, as it immediately gives people context, they can read more, and the official Twitter client also usually shows 2–3 tweets in a thread, giving you more “space” in the timeline. Here’s an example:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><h2 id="curating-your-timeline">Curating Your Timeline</h2><p>Who you follow defines your Twitter experience.

<p>I’ve <a href="https://davemateer.com/2019/07/28/Jekyll-Github-Pages">written a lot about using Jekyll</a> using Docker from Windows to get a good experience. However it can be slow to regenerate and update itself which is annoying.</p>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/WSL2">Here are my brief notes on setting up WSL2 on Win 10</a></p>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/windows-terminal">Here is setting up the new Windows Terminal to connect to WSL2</a></p>

<p>Below is my shot of running WSL2 and Jekyll.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR - it works really well</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/2020/05/19/jekyll-on-wsl2.html">Dylan Beattie’s article</a> and this <a href="https://medium.com/@hjgraca/using-wsl2-visual-studio-code-for-jekyll-blogging-on-windows-10-99489deb4650">Medium article</a> helped me along the way.</p>

<p>However I got errors like this following along with the Medium article:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ERROR:  Error installing zlib:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
extconf failed, <span>exit </span>code 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After some playing around this worked for me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get update <span>-y</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>sudo </span>apt-get upgrade <span>-y</span>

<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>ruby-full

<span>sudo </span>gem update

<span>sudo </span>gem <span>install </span>bundler

<span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>make gcc gpp build-essential zlib1g zlib1g-dev ruby-dev dh-autoreconf

<span>sudo </span>gem <span>install </span>jekyll

<span># inside jekyll repo</span>
<span>sudo </span>bundle <span>install</span>

<span># simple serve</span>
bundle <span>exec </span>jekyll serve

<span># I like to have reload working</span>
bundle <span>exec </span>jekyll serve force_polling <span>--livereload</span> <span>--unpublished</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS which I found out by typing this into bash:</p>



<h2 id="vscode---remote-wsl">VSCode - Remote WSL</h2>

<p>To easily view and edit files inside WSL2</p>

<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl">Remote - WSL extension</a></p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Perf went from 35 seconds to 10 seconds</p>

<p><img src="https://davemateer.com/assets/2020-10-19/perf.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Performance is still quite slow for me">]</p>

<p>After my laptop was left for a while this went down to around <strong>7 seconds - wow!</strong></p>

<h2 id="windows-explorer">Windows Explorer</h2>

<p>I take screenshots and use images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash</a> so I need an easy way to save to the WSL2 filesystem. From windows explorer address bar I typed in:</p>

<pre><code>\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\dave\djhmateer.github.io
</code></pre>

<p>Then put it in my Quick Access:</p>

<p><img src="https://davemateer.com/assets/2020-10-19/quick.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Quick access">]</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts-in-bash_aliases">Shortcuts in .bash_aliases</h2>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/windows-terminal">Windows Terminal blog post</a> where I drive things from now, includes all my useful alias shortcuts.</p>

<h2 id="mount-a-disk">Mount a disk</h2>

<p>If you’ve got <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/09/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20211/">Windows 10 Inside Preview Build 20211</a> you can mount a disk easily. To save images into WSL2 from Windows side, lets <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/access-linux-filesystems-in-windows-and-wsl-2/">mount a disk</a></p>

<p>I don’t have this build, so have stuck with the Windows explorer quick access way which seems to work for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m convinced and love having a faster regeneration of my site again.</p>

<p>At some point I will have to look at my Jekyll site and do some performance optimisations to make it regenerate faster.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>At Pixie, we are working on a Kubernetes native monitoring system which stores and processes the resulting data entirely within a user’s cluster. This is the first in a series of posts discussing techniques and best practices for effectively building Kubernetes native applications. In this post, we explore the trade-offs between using an air-gapped deployment that lives completely within a cluster and a system which splits the control and data planes between the cloud and cluster, respectively.  </p><p>One benefit of building for the Kubernetes platform is that it simplifies the process of deploying applications to a user’s environment, often requiring only a few simple steps such as applying a set of YAMLs or installing a Helm Chart. Within minutes, users can easily have a running version of the application on their cluster. However, now that these applications are running entirely on prem, it becomes difficult for the developer to manage. In many cases, rolling out major updates or bug fixes relies on having the user manually update their deployment. This is unreliable for the developer and burdensome for the user.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/e4ba6d3f5793c83a25a64e4fba9e2981/connected-on-prem.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of a connected on-prem architecture.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To address this problem, we propose a connected on-prem architecture which delegates the responsibility of managing the data and control planes of the application to the deployment running in the cluster and a developer-managed cloud environment, respectively. More concretely, the application deployed in the user’s cluster is solely responsible for collecting data and making that data accessible. Once the foundation of this data layer is established, the logic remains mostly stable and is infrequently updated. Meanwhile, a cloud-hosted system manages the core functionality and orchestration of the application. As the cloud is managed by the developer themselves, they are freely able to perform updates without any dependency on the users. This allows the developer to iterate quickly on the functionality of their system, all while maintaining data locality on prem.</p><p>This split-responsibility architecture is common in many hardware products, since external factors may make it challenging to deploy updates to software running on physical devices. For instance, despite these physical limitations, <a href="https://www.ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiqiti</a>’s UI is able to offer a rich feature-set by delegating functionality to their cloud and keeping their physical routers within the data plane. Similarly, <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebRTC</a> is a standard built into most modern browsers for handling voice and video data. Although browser updates are infrequent, having the separated data and control layers allows developers to freely build a diverse set of applications on top of WebRTC. This architecture is still relatively uncommon in enterprise software, but has been adopted by popular products such as <a href="https://harness.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/arch_2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harness</a>, <a href="https://streamsets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamsets</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthos</a>.</p><p>However, designing a connected on-prem architecture is easier said than done. When building such a system, one challenge you may encounter is how to query data from an application running on the user’s cluster via a UI hosted in the cloud. We explore two approaches for doing so:</p><ol><li>Making requests directly to the application in the cluster</li><li>Proxying requests through the cloud</li></ol><p>For brevity, we will refer to the application running on the user’s cluster as a satellite.</p><h2>Approach 1: Making Requests Directly to the Application in the Cluster</h2><p>The simplest approach for executing the query on a satellite is to have the UI make the request directly to the satellite itself. To do this, the UI must be able to get the (1) status and (2) address of the satellite from the cloud, so that it knows whether the satellite is available for querying and where it should make requests to. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/eb62b05f17165493ca6c988177555267/non-passthrough.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Non-Passthrough Mode where the UI makes requests directly to the satellite agent itself.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Heartbeating</h3><p>A common technique to track the status of a program is to establish a heartbeat sequence between the program (the satellite) and the monitoring system (the cloud). This is typically done by having the satellite first send a registration message to the cloud. During registration, the satellite either provides an identifier or is assigned an identifier via the cloud, which is used to identify the satellite in subsequent heartbeat messages.</p><p>Following registration, the satellite begins sending periodic heartbeats to the cloud to indicate it is alive and healthy. Additional information can be sent in these heartbeats. In our case, we also attach the satellite’s IP address. Alternatively, the IP address could have been sent during registration, if it is not subject to change. The cloud records the satellite’s status and address so that it can be queried by the UI.</p><p>Now, when the UI wants to make a request to a satellite, it first queries the cloud for the address, then directly makes the request to that address. </p><p>Great! That wasn’t too bad. In many cases, many cloud/distributed satellite architectures already communicate via heartbeats to track satellite state, so sending an additional address is no problem. However... If your UI is running on a browser and your satellite is responding over HTTPS (likely with self-signed certs), you are not done yet...</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/f178e72484d5e1de0dcc20d539cd25d6/cert-authority-invalid-1.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 2: Assigning Satellites a Domain Name</h3><p>The browser is blocking our requests because of the satellite’s SSL certs! A user could go ahead and navigate directly to the satellite’s address, where the browser prompts the user with whether or not they want to bypass the invalid cert.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2473c1e3bd36f293ccf4938cd7d1b4f4/cert-authority-invalid-2.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>However, this would need to be done per satellite and is disruptive to the user’s overall experience. It is possible to generate SSL certs for IP addresses, but this is uncommon and isn’t available with most free Certificate Authorities. This approach is also complicated if the satellite’s IP address is subject to change. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/16755003b378767879ee5d066ff07608/SSL-cert-flow.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of SSL certification flow for Non-Passthrough Mode.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To solve this problem, we used the following solution:</p><ol><li>Pre-generate SSL certs under a subdomain that you control, for instance: <code>&lt;uuid&gt;.satellites.yourdomain.com</code>. This step is easy to do with any free Certificate Authority <em>and can be safely done if the subdomain has a well-known DNS address</em>. You should make sure to generate more SSL certs than the number of expected satellites. </li><li>When an satellite registers with the cloud, it should be assigned an unused SSL cert and associated subdomain. The SSL cert should be securely sent to the satellite and the satellite’s proxy should be updated to use the new cert.</li><li>When the cloud receives the satellite’s IP address from its heartbeats, it updates the DNS record for the satellite’s subdomain to point to the IP address. </li><li>When executing queries, the UI can now safely make requests to the satellite’s assigned subdomain rather than directly to its IP address, all with valid certs!</li></ol><p>In the end, making requests directly to the satellites turned out to be more complicated (and hacky) than we’d originally thought. The solution also doesn’t scale well, since the SSL certs need to be pre-generated. Without having a fixed number of satellites, or an upperbound on the number of satellites, it isn’t long before all the certs have been assigned and someone needs to step in and manually generate more. It is possible to generate the certs and their DNS records on the fly, but we’ve found these operations can take too long to propagate to all networks. <em>It is also important to note that this approach may violate the terms of service for automated SSL generation and is susceptible to usual security risks of wildcard certificates.</em></p><p>When a satellite is behind a firewall, it will only be queryable by users within the network. This further ensures that no sensitive data leaves the network.</p><h2>Approach 2: Proxying Queries through the Server</h2><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2aea205714b53dd0286e660bec0c9370/passthrough-general.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Passthrough Mode where UI requests are proxied through the cloud.</figcaption></figure></div><p>As seen in the previous approach, it is easiest to have the UI make requests to the cloud to avoid any certificate errors. However, we still want the actual query execution to be handled by the satellites themselves. To solve this, we architected another approach which follows these general steps:</p><ol><li>User initiates query via the UI.</li><li>The cloud forwards the query to the appropriate satellite.</li><li>Satellite send its responses back to the cloud.</li><li>Cloud forwards responses back to the UI.</li></ol><p>The cloud must be able to handle multiple queries to many different satellites at once. A satellite will stream batches of data in response, which the server needs to send to the correct requestor. With so many messages flying back and forth, all of which need to be contained within their own request/reply channels, we thought this would be the perfect job for a message bus. </p><p>The next question was: which message bus should we use? </p><h3>Choosing a Message Bus</h3><p>We built up a list of criteria that we wanted our message bus to fulfill: </p><ul><li>It should receive and send messages quickly, especially since there is a user waiting at the receiving end.</li><li>It should be able to handle relatively large messages. An satellite’s query response can be batched into many smaller messages, but the size of a single datapoint can still be non-trivial.</li><li>Similarly, since an satellite’s response may be batched into many messages, the message bus should be able to handle a large influx of messages at any given time.</li><li>It should be easy to start new channels at any time. We may want to create a new channel per request or per satellite, all of which we have no fixed number.</li></ul><p>We briefly considered Google Pub/Sub, which had strict quota requirements (only 10,000 topics per Google project), and other projects such as Apache Pulsar. However, we primarily considered two messaging systems: Apache Kafka and NATS. General comparisons between Kafka and NATS have been discussed at length in other blogs. In this blog post, we aim to compare these two systems based on our requirements above.</p><p>We relied heavily on benchmarks that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/category/benchmarking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others have performed</a> to judge latency based on message size and message volume. These results lean in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>mTCP is a set of TCP/IP applications for personal computers running
PC-DOS, MS-DOS, FreeDOS, and other flavors of DOS. The applications
include:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_DHCP.html">DHCP</a>: a DHCP client for

</ul>

<p>mTCP runs on all variants of DOS including IBM PC-DOS,
Microsoft
MS-DOS, DR-DOS and FreeDOS. All of these applications will run well on
the oldest, slowest PC that you
can find - I routinely use them on an IBM PCjr made in 1983 because
nothing beats
the fun of putting a 35+ year old computer on the Internet.</p>

<p>People are using mTCP for goofing off and for real work. If
you have a DOS machine that needs to send data across the network mTCP
can help you get that done. Besides its utility to vintage computers I
have heard of people using it to transfer lab data from dedicated
industrial PCs, allowing backups to be run on old machines, and sending
sales reports from the branch offices of a retail store to a central
server.</p>

<p>Don't have a vintage computer laying around? No problem! mTCP
applications will run in a variety of virtual and emulated
environments. It has been tested with modified DOSBox builds,&nbsp;
VirtualBox, VMWare, and QEMU. See the documentation for the details.</p>



<p>mTCP applications should work on any IBM PC compatible personal
computer running
DOS. To be more specific:</p>

<ul>

  <li>An IBM PC compatible with an 8088 or better CPU</li>
  <li>96KB to 256KB of system memory depending on the application</li>
  <li>DOS 2.1 or newer</li>
  <li>A network card (Ethernet adapter, or a device emulating Ethernet)
that has a "packet driver" (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A packet driver is a utility that lets a program send and receive
Ethernet packets using your network card. The packet driver
specification is widely supported by both old and new
Ethernet cards. If your Ethernet card does not have a packet driver
available an NDIS or ODI driver with a "shim" to convert to the packet
specification should work but that will require more memory and be
slower
than having a real packet driver. SLIP and PPP connections are also
supported if they use a packet driver that emulates Ethernet. See <a href="http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html">http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html</a>
for more information on the packet driver specification.
</p>

<p>My personal testing includes:</p>

<p>Machines:</p>

<ul>

  <li>8088 class: IBM PC, IBM PC XT, IBM PCjr, IBM Portable PC, IBM
Convertible, IBM PS/2 Model 25, Compaq Portable</li>
  <li>80286/80386/80486: IBM PC AT, generic 80386-40, several generic
80486 systems, Compaq Deskpro 433i</li>
  <li>Pentium and better: generic Pentium 1, IBM Aptiva (AMD), generic
Pentium II</li>
  <li>Virtual machines: VMWare, VirtualBox</li>
  <li>Emulation environments: DOSBox (H-A-L 9000 "megabuild")<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Ethernet adapters:<br>

<ul>

  <li> <a href="http://www.brutman.com/Dos_Networking/xircom_pe3.html">Xircom
PE3-10BT</a></li>
  <li>Novell NE1000, NE2000 and clones</li>
  <li>3Com 3C503</li>
  <li>WD/SMC 8003 series</li>
  <li>Intel EtherExpress 8/16</li>
  <li>Davicom DM9008F</li>
  <li>LinkSys PCI</li>
  <li>SLIP/PPP connections using "EtherSLIP" (emulates Ethernet using a
serial connection.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Hundreds (thousands?) of people are using mTCP on a diverse set of
hardware. If your machine runs DOS and you have a packet driver for
your Ethernet card, then mTCP will probably work for you.&nbsp; SLIP
and PPP are also supported via EtherSLIP, so any machine with a serial
port can work too.

<p>mTCP is a hobby project that I started in 2005. While it is only a
hobby project, I take
pride in my work. If you have a comment, bug, or suggestion for a
feature please email me at mbbrutman at gmail.com. I might ask for
further
information or a trace from the program you are having trouble with.
Your bug reports help me make mTCP better for everybody else.</p>

<p>If you need a change to make mTCP work better for you I am
interested in hearing your requirements. I am willing to write custom
code if needed, but instead of charging for that service I suggest
making a donation to a local animal shelter of your choice. (I have
never seen an over-funded animal shelter.) Contact me with what you
need and I'll see what I can do. (And thank you to those who have taken
me up on this offer!)<br>
</p>

when packets are lost, HTGet significantly improved, Telnet ANSI
emulation improvements, the FTP client will try to automatically set
BIN mode to prevent accidental file corruption, CGA "snow"
work-arounds, and many small tweaks and fixes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>July 2015: Added the HTTPSERV and PKTTOOL programs; moved
documentation to a PDF file; many small improvements and some bug fixes<br>
  </li>
  <li>April 2013: IRCjr, Telnet client, FTP client, FTP server, and

</ul>

<p>Interested in seeing the source code that lets you talk
directly to a
packet driver? I have taken the lowest layer of the mTCP code and
packaged it
with a sample application that shows you how to interface a C program
with the software interrupt mechanism used by packet drivers. Check it
out here: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_tcpacket.html">mTCP_tcpacket.html</a></p>



<p><span></span>Jump in!&nbsp; See the mTCP
Programming Sample! <a href="http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html">http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html</a><br>
</p>

<p>All of the applications use the mTCP TCP/IP library which is
designed
for high performance even on small, slower machines. The code is
written in a combination of C++ and assembler. The style of coding is
more like "C with classes" to improve the structure of the code with
assembler being used in limited areas to improve the performance. The
source code is fairly well commented. You can look at
it as a framework for writing TCP/IP applications for DOS, complete
with plenty of examples.</p>

<p>Features include ARP, UDP, DNS, IP fragments, listen and
accept calls
for server applications, configurable buffer sizes, automatic
retransmit using Karne's algorithm, and run-time switchable tracing for
helping you debug. Features may be compiled in or out as needed so that
you can minimize the overhead of the TCP/IP library and include only
the features that you need. mTCP does not use floating point
operations, avoiding the code bloat of the floating point emulation
library.</p>

<p>mTCP is designed to be robust. DOS is a challenging
environment to work
in because quite frankly, it is not much of an operating system. mTCP
attempts to minimize problems by using defensive programming
techniques. Not every programming error can be prevented, but the
library tries to help you where it can. For example, to prevent
fragmentation in the DOS heap mTCP generally preallocates pools of
objects and manages the objects instead of repeatedly allocating and
freeing memory using the DOS heap. The FTP server and the IRC client
have been demonstrated to run for days without leaking memory or
crashing the machine.</p>

<p>High performance is a key feature of mTCP. The library is
written to
avoid excess memory copying wherever possible. Assembler is used on
some code for both performance and to avoid making expensive library
calls that will just invoke BIOS or DOS routines anyway. For the
ultimate in performance you can choose to handle raw packets directly
in your application layer code, or you can use higher level "send" and
"recv" type calls instead. The ability to adjust buffer sizes allows
you to balance speed versus memory footprint. Want to see how fast mTCP
is? Here are some performance measurements
for FTP and for raw socket performance: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Performance.html">mTCP
Performance notes</a></p>

<p>mTCP is only available as a library that you link with your
application. A TSR version that can be used by software interrupt is
not available. While a TSR version would allow more programming
environments access to TCP/IP services, it is a much more difficult
environment to work in and debug. Performance would also suffer too. It
would be an interesting project though - if you want to collaborate on
the design for a TSR version of mTCP please contact me.</p>

<p>(For a TCP/IP stack that loads as a TSR see Trumpet by Peter Tattam.
Trumpet can usually be found by searching for TCPDRV or NTCPDRV. WATTCP
is an older, more widespread TCP/IP stack that can be used as an
alternative to mTCP. Neither Trumpet or WATTCP are actively
maintained.)</p>

<section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>We are doing a deep dive into the academic literature but are starting with 3 main textbooks and an assortment of peer-reviewed papers. We are also consulting with the leading professors in the field of statistical arbitrage so that their experience and knowledge of the tools can be added to the library.</p>
<p>The very first version that we are releasing in November will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The famous distance strategy (most-cited)</li>
<li>Advanced distance measures</li>
<li>Co-integration tests</li>
<li>Kalman Filter</li>
<li>OU and XOU models + fitting</li>
<li>Optimal stopping and switching</li>
<li>Models to determine time-series properties</li>
<li>n-asset mean reverting portfolios</li>
<li>PCA technique</li>
</ol>
<p>Then in the months to follow we will add machine learning models to identify pairs, ARODs, and various ways to model and trade the spread. A lot of what we build next will be based on user feedback and the tools that they use the most.</p>
<p>The new library will start off as a monthly subscription service, with the python library being installed locally, so users can still view the source code and audit the techniques.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><blockquote><p>This post was originally written as the introduction to <a href="https://devopsish.com/188/">DevOps’ish 188</a>, has been modified based on feedback, and deemed worthy to share as its own blog post.</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://twitter.com/wocintechchat">Christina Morillo</a> from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/adult-computer-eyewear-female-1181325/">Pexels</a></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brunoborges/status/1315230767207784450">We kinda went down a rabbit hole</a> the other day when I suggested folks check out <a href="https://dev.to/vikcodes/yq-a-command-line-tool-that-will-help-you-handle-your-yaml-resources-better-8j9"><em>yq</em></a>, “The aim of the project is to be the jq or sed of yaml files.” First, there’s nothing wrong with this project. I like it, I find the tool useful, and that’s that. But the great debate started over our lord and savior, <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Yeah, I know, XML vs. JSON vs. YAML vs. TOML vs. the next thing is a tired and old debate.</p><p>Let me level set here. I routinely joke about how I’m a “Calendar Driven YAML Engineer” and have been for years on <a href="https://openshift.tv/">openshift.tv</a>. But I’m not too fond of YAML. Let me tell you a story…</p><p>In 2012, I worked at McClatchy Interactive (before the really dark times) and enjoyed the systems and security work I was doing. We had our machine creation down to a finite science. Bare metal spun up, you punched the MAC address into a database file, and off the machine went to get all the needed packaging and code to run as its defined purpose in our infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine">CFEngine</a> provisioned the machine accordingly based on purpose and positioned it in the network ready for code deployment. DevOps was something the company was embracing at the time. So instead of using the existing CFEngine infrastructure, the DevOps tandem at the time was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(company)">Puppet</a> for code deploys. This system worked fine until it didn’t. There were clear lines between infrastructure (typical IT in the datacenter) and software deployment and configuration (developers). In our case, DevOps represented the development team more so than the Operations team. Sound familiar?</p><p>But, as you can imagine, even with all the automation in place, it was still a throw over the wall kind of scenario. When Puppet needed system packages installed because of modifications to the codebase (requiring a newer version of Perl, for example) or new services coming online using different OS packages, Puppet now had to do the task CFEngine was doing; systems management. The idea was to build an overarching WebOps team that was cross-functional, spirited, and deeply technical. The first edict laid down to the team by the DevOps lead was, “read the <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML spec</a>.” We were all jumping into the Puppet pool to help integrate our processes and procedures better.</p><p>“Ugh…” I thought to myself. “I have to read this horribly written spec.” It was not an RFC, which I am fond of reading, but something about the YAML spec made me sad and frustrated. Syntax <em>really</em> mattered. Whitespace <em>really</em> mattered. My experiences have taught me that rote memorization and getting humans to see the absence of something were incredibly difficult tasks. These are things that most hackers take advantage of when infiltrating systems. Humans aren’t as good as computers at finding the absence of something or memorizing things. I was not too fond of this non-markup language for these reasons.</p><p>It irked me that the YAML creators laid out goal #1 as “YAML is easily readable by humans.” It is human-readable because you see the human-readable words in the scalars and structures, but there was something off-putting about YAML. It was a markup language claiming not to be a markup language. I held the firm belief that markup languages are supposed to make things simpler for humans, not harder (XML is the antithesis of markup languages, in my opinion).</p><p>Here I was, relatively fresh to the DevOps game, learning some core developer concepts to understand a markup language, the crux of which was two Achilles heels. I also didn’t like how big, bulky, and cumbersome Puppet was to work with. But, here I was thrust headfirst into this world. Might as well make the best of it. I’ve since embraced YAML, but it doesn’t mean I’m writing my notes in YAML format.</p><div><div id="sib-form-container"><div id="error-message"><div><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M256 40c118.621.0 216 96.075 216 216 0 119.291-96.61 216-216 216-119.244.0-216-96.562-216-216 0-119.203 96.602-216 216-216m0-32C119.043 8 8 119.083 8 256c0 136.997 111.043 248 248 248s248-111.003 248-248C504 119.083 392.957 8 256 8zm-11.49 120h22.979c6.823.0 12.274 5.682 11.99 12.5l-7 168c-.268 6.428-5.556 11.5-11.99 11.5h-8.979c-6.433.0-11.722-5.073-11.99-11.5l-7-168c-.283-6.818 5.167-12.5 11.99-12.5zM256 340c-15.464.0-28 12.536-28 28s12.536 28 28 28 28-12.536 28-28-12.536-28-28-28z"></path></svg><p><span>Your subscription could not be saved.

It’s not friendly to new people in the same sense <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> isn’t. <a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/">Kubernetes</a> has almost abused YAML to the point that it has become a punchline. And we’ve stuck ourselves with it for a long time to come too. If Kubernetes is the platform of the future, that means we’ll be using a spec written in 2009 well into the 2030s (and likely beyond).</p><p>I hope that a drop in replacement is possible. The fact that we need tools like <a href="https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/">yq</a> does show that there is some work to be done when it comes to wrangling the YAML beast at scale. In 2009, when the latest version of the YAML spec was written, no one thought of applying pod security policies to massive Kubernetes deployments spread out across data centers the world over. Something better will come along and I hope adopting it isn’t as painful as adopting YAML is.</p><p>Remember, comparing things relatively to like something (YAML vs. XML or YAML vs. JSON) completely throws out the beginner’s journey. Start from the newb and go forward from there. YAML doesn’t. Git doesn’t. Incrementally, YAML is better than XML but, it sucks compared to something like HTML or Markdown (which I can teach to execs and children alike). Yes, balancing machine and human readability is hard. The compromises suck, but, at some point, there’s enough compute to run a process to take in something 100% human-readable and make it 100% machine-readable. In the same sense that compute has become so readily available that we gzip and encrypt almost all HTTP traffic today, I hope we can do the same with systems configuration languages. Move the complexity from the human to code. Computers are better at remembering things and syntax-semantics than humans could ever hope to be.</p><p>There’s always a happy medium between human and machine readability. However, I’d much rather see a human first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">80-20</a> approach here where entry-level skills can solve 80% of the markup language’s use cases. That’s the true nirvana, in my opinion. There will always be complexity and a need to understand the tool you’re using. But, YAML gives us an example that there can and should be better things.</p><hr><h4>See also</h4><ul><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/2019-learnings-2020-expectations/">2019 Learnings, 2020 Expectations</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/">Docker, Inc is Dead</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/live-streaming-on-openshift.tv-and-some-lessons-learned/">Live streaming on openshift.tv and some lessons learned</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a> asks how to decide between the lives of people in two groups. At the moment, it comes up in our industry in discussions around self-driving cars: Suppose a car gets into a situation where it must risk injuring either its passengers or pedestrians; which ones should it prioritize saving?</p>
<p>Always choosing one group leads to suboptimal outcomes. If we always save the pedestrians, they may perform attacks on car riders by willfully stepping into traffic. If we always save the passengers, we may run over a pedestrian whose life happens to be of greater worth than that of the passengers.</p>
<p>The crux of the trolley problem is how we should make the choice of what lives to save. As with all hard problems without clear metrics for success, it’s best to solve this by having the participants decide this for themselves.</p>
<p>Every time we view a website, our friendly ad networks must decide what ads we should see. This is done by having our user profile put up on auction for prospective advertisers. During a handful of milliseconds, participants may inspect our profile and place a bid for our attention according to what they see.</p>
<p>The same technology could be trivially repurposed for deciding the trolley problem in the context of self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Assume the identity of every participant in the trolley scenario is known. Practically, we know the identity of the passengers; that of the pedestrians could be known if their phones broadcast a special short-range identification signal. An incentive for broadcasting such a signal could be that we would have to assume that a person without one were one of no means.</p>
<p>Given this information, a car about to be involved in a collision could take a few milliseconds to send the identities of the people involved to an auction service. Participants who had the foresight of purchasing accident insurance would have agents bidding on their behalf. The winner of the bid would be safe from the forthcoming accident, and their insurance would pay some sum to the car manufacturer post-hoc as a reward for conforming to the rules.</p>
<p>The greater a person’s individual wealth, the better insurance coverage and latencies they could purchase, and the more accidents they could expect to survive. This aligns nicely with the values of societies like the United States, where the worth of a person’s life is proportional to their wealth.</p>
<p>As this system lets self-driving car manufacturers off the hook for any decisions taken, and would need coordinated ethical action on the behalf of software engineers to not be implemented, we expect to see this system in action in the world in short order.</p>

        <p>Posted on Hacker News there was an <a href="https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/plan.md">Implementation Plan</a>
for making CPython (the official Python implementation) faster. The author claims a 5x speedup
is possible for the low cost of <a href="https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/funding.md">$2 million</a> USD.</p>
<p>The four step plan includes</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an adaptive interpreter</li>
<li>improvements to internal types</li>
<li>creating a JIT compiler</li>
<li>extending the JIT compiler</li>
</ul>
<p>We have witnessed other attempts at making Python fast, each achieving their own degree
of success in terms of performance and compatibility. For posterity I started keeping a
list of them here, in no particular order.</p>
<p>(update: added more projects from HN comments - ones that make at least some claim about
performance, thanks!)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main textStuff" role="main">
<main role="main">

<p>I teach SEO to a lot of people. Either in my role as an actual teacher for a university, within the organization I work for or as an advisor for a venture capital firm. I've found that while SEO has changed a lot over the years, much of what I teach is just my repeating a few simple things that have always worked and will always work. </p>
<p>They revolve around strategy. </p>
<p>Talking about SEO strategy is nothing new. Every agency out there will tout the amazing strategy they'll build for you and most companies will tell you they have some sort of SEO strategy but I would counter that people are mixing up tactics and strategy. </p>
<p>Let's take a step back though. What do I mean? </p>
<h2 id="seo-is-a-lot-of-work">SEO is a lot of work</h2>
<p>The way I generally frame my SEO class for university is that SEO is hard. I think anyone who has done it for any length of time would agree with that. On-page SEO, content creation, link building and all that can take huge amounts of time and effort and can be an insane amount of work, even for a whole team of people. </p>
<p>Which is why I spend the majority of the class talking about research rather than all the above. </p>
<h2 id="the-research-before-the-research">The research before the research</h2>
<p>The morning of the whole day class is focused on understanding who your customer is what they want. Not just your "customer" but who is your <strong>best</strong> customer? Are there a subset of customers that give you recurring revenue or a one time purchase? Do you have a life time value calculation you use? What do you know about these great customers? Can you email them some questions or a survey? Make sure you understand them and how they found you. </p>
<p>Then we go into competitors. Who are they? Do they have a massive SEO budget you'll be up against? Are there weaknesses you can use against them? Maybe you can re-frame or reposition your company so you don't seem like a competitor. </p>
<p>If you don't properly do your research, you'll be spending thousands of hours on something that could lead to nothing, when if you do your research you may need to do far less work and get huge returns. </p>
<p>Basically what I'm saying, is if your SEO strategy <strong>starts</strong> with keyword research, you may have failed before you even began. </p>
<p>The keyword research needs to be informed by your customers and competition. Just trying to find long tail keywords without understanding the context of why they are being typed in is asking for disaster. </p>
<h2 id="then-finally-the-keyword-research">Then finally, the keyword research</h2>
<p>After the students have done all that research work we finally get into the standard keyword research. This research is now going to be very different than if they had started with it. They wont just be typing keywords related to what they do, instead they'll be using the word choices their customers will lean towards and that competitors haven't touched. </p>
<p>Next I make sure they understand the context of the keyword being typed into Google. Where is the person? Why did they type in this keyword? What are they trying to accomplish? Are they just trying to answer some homework or are curious about something? If so, do you really want to work towards getting this person who likely wont buy anything? </p>
<p>At this point you'll have a simple list of keywords. It wont seem like much in excel but trust me, that list is far more powerful than the one made by the majority of agencies or companies. It is informed by competitive research, customer research and it understands the context of the person typing in the query. Then and only then should you get into the actual tactics. </p>
<p>These tactics include putting together a content strategy, making on-page changes to your site and ultimately having a link building strategy to support them. </p>
<h2 id="in-short">In Short</h2>
<p>SEO is far too much work to jump in headfirst without doing your due diligence. </p>

<![CDATA[Why You Should Do A Paid Discovery Phase]]>
            </title>
            <description>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s say you’re a consultant starting the conversation with a potential new client. They’ve decided to kick off a new technology project. Sweet! It’s an investment for them that carries a lot of opportunity… and risk.</p>
<p>Success could increase your client’s revenue, reduce their costs, and save them time. An unsuccessful project could have immeasurable costs, particularly for companies that rely on tech as a big part of their business model.</p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to do everything possible to make sure that your projects are successful. While every project and business is different, I’ve learned a few key things the hard way. One of the things that proves its worth every time is focusing on business goals - <strong>before starting to build</strong>. This sounds cliché but here’s what I mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask your clients about their BUSINESS problems and offer a BUSINESS solution. Before talking about development or technology or process. What is it that is costing them money or not making them money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds simple. It should be. For some reason, it’s really common to skip this and go straight to solutioning. Maybe if we give it a name, it’ll be taken seriously. Let’s call it <em>Discovery</em>...</p>
<h3 id="what-is-discovery"><a href="#what-is-discovery" aria-label="what is discovery permalink"></a>What is Discovery?</h3>
<p>Discovery means exploring and pulling the unknown out into the light. A Discovery phase is a paid consulting engagement which comes before the part where you build the solution. The reason a company might do it is to reduce or eliminate risk during the build, saving both time and money by avoiding costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Discovery can look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a series of conversations between you and people across the client team</li>
<li>diving in and checking out your clients’ current operational &amp; technical systems</li>
<li>researching different options that might be a good fit for your client</li>
</ul>
<p>Discovery can result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>written documentation of your findings (discoveries)</li>
<li>recommendations for the best method or approach to your solutions, including platform selection, systems architecture, apps, extensions, custom features, &amp; integrations</li>
<li>technical solution requirements, roadmaps, planning resources to tee up the build phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things you should try to nail down during Discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Goals, Opportunities, and Objectives</li>
<li>Project Risks</li>
<li>Who’s Involved (Stakeholders)</li>
<li>Expectations</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
<li>Technical Unknowns</li>
<li>Functional “Must Haves”</li>
<li>Solution Definition</li>
<li>Project Delivery Timelines</li>
<li>Costing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-project-doesnt-need-a-discovery"><a href="#my-project-doesnt-need-a-discovery" aria-label="my project doesnt need a discovery permalink"></a>My Project Doesn’t Need A Discovery</h3>
<p>For projects with tight budgets and timelines, a Discovery might seem like an unaffordable luxury. I get it. Experience has taught me that even smaller projects can save time and money by thinking strategically upfront.</p>
<p>With the information collected, you can be confident in what’s being developed and the cost. Discovery doesn’t have to take a long time. Everyone wants to cut as much overhead as possible.</p>
<p>It’s easy to jump straight into building when you start on a project. It feels productive. Everyone loves shortcuts to save time. I’ve made that mistake before. The reality is that most times it will end up taking longer and being more costly this way.</p>
<p>What’s usually missing a realistic and informed plan. In this world of agile everything, planning gets a bad name. Being aware of the unknowns isn’t wasteful though. It lets you see speed bumps coming and avoid them.</p>
<p>Often business owners will come to you self-diagnosed and self-prescribed, seeking specific solutions. In these instances, <strong>it is your obligation as a professional to validate these assumptions</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-this-going-to-help"><a href="#how-is-this-going-to-help" aria-label="how is this going to help permalink"></a>How Is This Going To Help?</h3>
<p>The truth is, technology is always changing. Often there are many different ways to use technology in solving a problem. Sometimes technology isn’t needed at all. Sometimes a change in process will get you a better result. For these reasons, your ability to understand, diagnose, and solve your clients’ business problems will always be more important than your application of a specific technology. Your clients don’t pay for the creation and application of technology - <em>they pay to solve business problems</em>.</p>
<p>The Discovery process protects the much larger investment your clients are making in building a technology solution. Better planning leads to less expensive projects.</p>
<p>Other consultants might offer “cheaper” projects without a formal discovery process. When you come up against this, ask your clients: “If we’re not doing a discovery process, can we trust the accuracy of the quote? Are we confident that this group really understands your needs? Can we trust that the proposed solutions address your goals? If not, do we believe a project without discovery will truly be cheaper long-term?”</p>
<h3 id="how-to-communicate-this"><a href="#how-to-communicate-this" aria-label="how to communicate this permalink"></a>How To Communicate This</h3>
<p>As an added bonus, here’s an actual template for an email I’ve used to get a new client onboard with the Discovery process. Feel free to use it!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Hi NAME, thanks for the information. I can get started quickly, though I would love to learn more about your needs and goals so that I’m better positioned to help you. </p><p>I use a standard process in helping to develop solutions for this type of challenge, starting with a fast Discovery. Experience has taught me that even smaller projects can save time and money by creating a realistic and informed plan of attack. With the information collected, we can both be confident in what is being developed, the timeline, and the cost. It removes risk and improves the outcome for us both. </p><p>Let me know your availability to start exploring solutions. I’m looking forward to getting started.</p></div>
</blockquote></div><p>I write about tips for consulting, technology, &amp; saving the planet. Keep up with new posts. Unsubscribe whenever. I promise I won't spam you.</p></div>]]>

<p>Data teams are starting to realize that operational machine learning requires solving data problems that extend far beyond the creation of data pipelines.</p>



<p>In Tecton’s previous post, <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/devops-ml-data/">Why We Need DevOps for ML Data</a>, we highlighted some of the key data challenges that teams face when productionizing ML systems.</p>



<ul><li>Accessing the right raw data</li><li>Building features from raw data</li><li>Combining features into training data</li><li>Calculating and serving features in production</li><li>Monitoring features in production</li></ul>



<p>Production data systems, whether for large scale analytics or real-time streaming, aren’t new. However, <em>operational machine learning</em> — ML-driven intelligence built into customer-facing applications — is new for most teams. The challenge of deploying machine learning to production for operational purposes (e.g. recommender systems, fraud detection, personalization, etc.) introduces new requirements for our data tools.</p>



<p>A new kind of ML-specific data infrastructure is emerging to make that possible.</p>



<p>Increasingly Data Science and Data Engineering teams are turning towards feature stores to manage the data sets and data pipelines needed to productionize their ML applications. This post describes the key components of a modern feature store and how the sum of these parts act as a force multiplier on organizations, by reducing duplication of data engineering efforts, speeding up the machine learning lifecycle, and unlocking a new kind of collaboration across data science teams.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Quick refresher: in ML, a <strong>feature</strong> is data used as an input signal to a predictive model.</td></tr><tr><td>For example, if a credit card company is trying to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent, a useful feature might be <em>whether the transaction is happening in a foreign country</em>, or <em>how the size of this transaction compares to the customer’s typical transaction</em>. When we refer to a feature, we’re usually referring to the concept of that signal (e.g. “transaction_in_foreign_country”), not a specific value of the feature (e.g. not “transaction #1364 was in a foreign country”).</td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>











<p><strong><em>“The interface between models and data”</em></strong></p>



<p>We first introduced feature stores in our blog post describing Uber’s <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/">Michelangelo</a> platform. Feature stores have since emerged as a necessary component of the operational machine learning stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feature stores make it easy to:</p>



<ol><li>Productionize new features without extensive engineering support</li><li>Automate feature computation, backfills, and logging</li><li>Share and reuse feature pipelines across teams</li><li>Track feature versions, lineage, and metadata</li><li>Achieve consistency between training and serving data</li><li>Monitor the health of feature pipelines in production</li></ol>



<p>Feature stores aim to solve the full set of data management problems encountered when building and operating operational ML applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A feature store is an ML-specific data system that:</p>



<ul><li>Runs data pipelines that <strong>transform</strong> raw data into feature values</li><li><strong>Stores</strong> and manages the feature data itself, and</li><li><strong>Serves</strong> feature data consistently for training and inference purposes</li></ul>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore10.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>To support simple feature management, feature stores provide data abstractions that make it easy to build, deploy, and reason about feature pipelines across environments. For example, they make it easy to define a feature transformation once, then calculate and serve its values consistently across both the development environment (for training on historical values) and the production environment (for inference with fresh feature values).</p>



<p>Feature stores act as a central hub for feature data and metadata across an ML project’s lifecycle. Data in a feature store is used for:</p>



<ul><li>feature exploration and engineering</li><li>model iteration, training, and debugging</li><li>feature discovery and sharing</li><li>production serving to a model for inference</li><li>operational health monitoring</li></ul>



<p>Feature stores bring economies of scale to ML organizations by enabling collaboration. When a feature is registered in a feature store, it becomes available for immediate reuse by other models across the organization. This reduces duplication of data engineering efforts and allows new ML projects to bootstrap with a library of curated production-ready features.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore9.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Effective feature stores are designed to be modular systems that can be adapted to the environment in which they’re deployed. There are five primary components that typically make up a feature store. In the rest of this post, we will walk through those components and describe their role in powering operational ML applications.</p>







<p>There are 5 main components of a modern feature store: Transformation, Storage, Serving, Monitoring, and feature Registry.</p>



<figure><img alt="" data-src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore3.svg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>In the following sections we’ll give an overview of the purpose and typical capabilities of each of these sections.</p>



<h2>Serving</h2>



<p>Feature stores serve feature data to models. Those models require a <strong>consistent view of features across training and serving</strong>. The definitions of features used to train a model must exactly match the features provided in online serving. When they don’t match, <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#:~:text=Training%2Dserving%20skew%20is%20a,train%20and%20when%20you%20serve.">training-serving skew</a> is introduced which can cause catastrophic and hard-to-debug model performance problems.</p>



<p><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore5.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>







<p>Feature stores abstract away the logic and processing used to generate a feature, providing users an easy and canonical way to access all features in a company consistently across all environments in which they’re needed.</p>



<p>When retrieving data offline (i.e. for training), feature values are commonly accessed through notebook-friendly feature store SDKs. They provide point-in-time correct views of the state of the world for each example used to train a model (a.k.a. “<a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/time-travel-in-ml/"><strong>time-travel</strong></a>”).</p>



<p>For online serving, a feature store delivers a single vector of features at a time made up of the freshest feature values. Responses are served through a high-performance API backed by a low-latency database.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore11.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>Feature stores persist feature data to support retrieval through feature serving layers. They typically contain both an online and offline storage layer to support the requirements of different feature serving systems.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore8.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Offline storage layers are typically used to store months’ or years’ worth of feature data for training purposes. Offline feature store data is often stored in data warehouses or data lakes like S3, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift. Extending an existing data lake or data warehouse for offline feature storage is typically preferred to prevent data silos.</p>



<p>Online storage layers are used to persist feature values for low-latency lookup during inference. They typically only store the latest feature values for each entity, essentially modeling the current state of the world. Online stores are usually eventually consistent, and do not have strict consistency requirements for most ML use cases. They are usually implemented with key-value stores like DynamoDB, Redis, or Cassandra.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore6.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Feature stores use an entity-based data model where each feature value is associated with an entity (e.g. a user) and a timestamp. An entity-based data model provides minimal structure to support standardized feature management, fits naturally with common feature engineering workflows, and allows for simple retrieval queries in production.</p>



<h2>Transformation</h2>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore2.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Operational ML applications require regular processing of new data into feature values so models can make predictions using an up-to-date view of the world. Feature stores both manage and orchestrate data transformations that produce these values, as well as ingest values produced by external systems. Transformations managed by feature stores are configured by definitions in a common feature registry (described below).</p>



<figure><p>Most teams getting started with feature stores already have existing data pipelines producing feature values. This makes it very important for feature stores to be gradually adoptable and have first class integrations with existing data platforms, allowing teams to immediately operationalize existing ETL pipelines for their ML use cases.</p></figure>



<p>Feature stores commonly interact with three main types of data transformations:</p>







<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Feature Type</td><td>Definition</td><td>Common input data source</td><td data-align="left">Example</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Batch Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied only to data at rest</td><td>Data warehouse, data lake, database</td><td data-align="left">User country, product category</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Streaming Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied to streaming sources</td><td>Kafka, Kinesis, PubSub</td><td data-align="left"># of clicks per vertical per user in last 30 minutes, # of views per listing in past hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">On-demand transform</td><td>Transformations that are used to produce features&nbsp; based on data that is only available at the time of the prediction. These features cannot be pre-computed.</td><td>User-facing application</td><td data-align="left">Is the user currently in a supported location?<br>Similarity score between listing and search query</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A key benefit is to make it easy to use different types of features together in the same models.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore12.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Models need access to fresh feature values for inference. Feature stores accomplish this by regularly recomputing features on an ongoing basis. Transformation jobs are orchestrated to ensure new data is processed and turned into fresh new feature values. These jobs are executed on data processing engines (e.g. Spark or Pandas) to which the feature store is connected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Model development introduces different transformation requirements. When iterating on a model, new features are often engineered to be used in training datasets that correspond to historical events (e.g. all purchases in the past 6 months). To support these use cases, feature stores make it easy to run “backfill jobs” that generate and persist historical values of a feature for training. Some feature stores automatically backfill newly registered features for preconfigured time ranges for registered training datasets.</p>



<p>Transformation code is reused across environments preventing …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today on Makerlog Stories, we interview maker, writer &amp; entrepreneur Arvid Kahl. He's grown a successful SaaS, Feedback Panda, to astronomical MRR levels â€“ to then sell the startup &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Sold-Start-Bootstrapped-Business-ebook/dp/B08BWZS8VN">write a hit book</a> to share his breadth of knowledge.</p><h2 id="hi-arvid-tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-">Hi Arvid! Tell us a bit about yourself.</h2><p>Iâ€™m Arvid, a developer, entrepreneur, and writer. Iâ€™ve been coding for most of my life, and Iâ€™ve always been interested in building businesses. Over the last two decades, I worked as a software engineer for small businesses, VC-funded Silicon Valley startups, and founded a number of bootstrapped businesses with friends and colleagues. Most recently, I sold the EdTech SaaS FeedbackPanda for a life-changing amount of money after growing it to $55.000 MRR with my partner Danielle Simpson from 2017 to 2019. The learnings from that journey have been the foundation for my book Zero to Sold.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-building-arvid">What are you building, Arvid?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getmakerlog.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png"></figure><p>Ever since selling the business, I have been writing. I didnâ€™t have any time to meaningfully reflect on my experiences while I was running FeedbackPanda. The moment we sold the company, I suddenly had all the time I needed to think about my experiences and translate them into stories and guidance for other founders. </p><p>Iâ€™m blogging every week, I release a new podcast episode every Friday, and I am currently working on my <a href="https://audiencefirst.link/">next book, â€œAudience Firstâ€�</a>.</p><h2 id="as-of-right-now-what-are-your-stats">As of right now, what are your stats?</h2><p>Zero to Sold has sold almost 2500 copies in its first quarter on the market. </p><p>I donâ€™t track much more beyond that, as having sold a business recently makes this less important. What I do track is how engaged people are with my work, and I can report that with almost 9000 followers on Twitter, this is looking pretty good.</p><h2 id="what-was-the-inspiration-behind-zero-to-sold"><br>What was the inspiration behind Zero to Sold?</h2><p>When we sold the business and transitioned it over to the new owners, we quickly realized that all of a sudden, we had come to an abrupt halt after working 24/7 for years. Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </p><blockquote>Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </blockquote><p>Very quickly, I decided that I needed to turn our experience into something useful for the community that had taught and lifted me up over many years. Initially, I didnâ€™t think of writing a book, but just writing articles. At some point, however, it was very clear that all those topics I wrote about were connected, and a book would pull them all together.</p><h2 id="what-was-it-like-to-sell-feedbackpanda">What was it like to sell FeedbackPanda?</h2><p>Selling a business is incredibly exciting, and it is very scary. Most people donâ€™t regularly sell their livelihood, and the amounts of money involved are staggering. It was a wonderful experience, mostly because our acquirer SureSwift Capital were such a joy to work with. The sale, the transition, and onboarding our replacements were delightful activities. Iâ€™d definitely do it again.</p><h2 id="how-was-the-process-of-writing-zero-to-sold">How was the process of writing Zero to Sold?</h2><p>Many chapters were already written when I decided that I would write a book, as I had posted to my blog for many months at that point. The rest of them were written in an intense flurry of writing that happened over the course of two weeks.</p><p><strong>I already had a lot of validation from my blog audience, and I knew which topics they would want me to write about because I asked them.</strong> I asked on Twitter, I asked in the Newsletter, I asked on my podcast. I was confident that the things I had yet to write were interesting because people demanded content, and I knew that the things I had already written were well-received because the blog visitor numbers painted that picture.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-spread-the-word-of-the-book">How did you spread the word of the book? </h2><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A few people have been asking me why I sell a 500-page book for $9.99 when it could sell for 4x that.</p><p>I want Zero to Sold to be affordable AND contain everything I know about building businesses. I want as many people as possible to read the book. That's it. Money is secondary.</p></div>— Arvid Kahl (@arvidkahl) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1286377587757981696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p><strong>I utilized Twitter substantially for the promotion of Zero to Sold.</strong> On the very first day, I published a long Twitter thread with all sorts of links, insights into why I wrote the book, who it was for, and where to find it. I engaged with everyone who liked the post, thanked everyone who retweeted it, and took a lot of time to be present for my Twitter followers. Very quickly, sales took off, and I leveraged that too. I shared screenshots of climbing numbers, which themselves encouraged people to check out the book. </p><p>The next day, I launched on Product Hunt, and had Zero to Sold in the #1 spot for 18 hours. For the next few weeks, I shared a lot of sales figures, and I engaged with everyone who talked about the book on Twitter. I still do that today, and that is, in essence, the only marketing I do. I talk about the book, and I point at people who talk about it.</p><h2 id="did-it-ever-cross-your-mind-that-zero-to-sold-would-be-such-a-hit">Did it ever cross your mind that Zero to Sold would be such a hit?</h2><blockquote>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</blockquote><p>When I launched the book, I hoped to sell twenty books on day one, maybe 50. Within the first 24 hours, I sold 350 books, and 1000 within the first week. I never thought the book would be that successful, no.</p><p> But I do recognize that Zero to Sold was an opportunity for many of my followers to finally give something back. I had written valuable content for months, for free. Now here was a chance to say thank you. Many people took that opportunity and showed me their support.</p><h2 id="publishing-is-an-interesting-business-how-were-your-interactions-with-it-the-editing-process-getting-the-book-out-there-etc-">Publishing is an interesting business: how were your interactions with it? (the editing process, getting the book out there, etc.)</h2><p>Once I had finished my first draft, I immediately hired a copy editor from Reedsy and had them work on the book. I knew that I couldnâ€™t â€œjust ship itâ€� â€” after all, this is not a piece of software that can be easily deployed and updated. Once a book is in a bookshelf, it wonâ€™t change. So I had to make sure the quality of the book was high enough from the start. After the copy editing, I had a professional proofreader go through it again. </p><p>All in all, somewhere around 5000 things needed to be changed. I worked in those changes, made sure they still fit my vision, and then I was finally done. I used <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/how-i-self-published-zero-to-sold-a-bestselling-book-on-bootstrapping/">a number of tools</a> to create the print and digital versions from the same source manuscript, which I then uploaded to Amazon KDP and Gumroad, making the book available within a few days as a print-on-demand paperback, as a PDF, and for eReaders.</p><h2 id="would-you-change-anything-in-your-book-if-so-what-would-it-be">Would you change anything in your book? If so, what would it be?</h2><p>I would probably add even more anecdotes, because many people learn best from stories of other peopleâ€™s successes and failures. But the book is already 500 pages, any more and it would become a safety hazard. </p><p>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</p><h2 id="what-were-some-of-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-ve-faced-as-an-entrepreneur">What were some of the biggest challenges that you've faced as an entrepreneur?</h2><p><br>Personally, I found that I had the most trouble delegating. This resulted in us never hiring another customer service representative or engineer, both positions that could have helped me while we ran the business. </p><p>As a consequence, I developed severe stress and anxieties, stuff that I am still working on today. <strong>If you value your mental health, consider that finding other people that can help you is a net gain, not a loss.</strong> I write about this kind of self-delusion extensively in Zero to Sold, because I want founders to understand that they can easily fall prey to their own minds, and that theyâ€™re better off understanding the demons they might be facing on their own journey.</p><hr><h2 id="we-found-out-that-you-studied-political-science-and-computer-science-how-has-that-combination-shaped-your-way-of-thinking">We found out that you studied political science and computer science; how has that combination shaped your way of thinking?</h2><p>Computer science and political science both depend on a clear understanding of logic. No matter if youâ€™re looking through a codebase of a political institution, you will find infrastructure, decisions, policies, and consequences. Studying two fields that look at seemingly different topics with a similar underlying foundation has allowed me to work with multiple perspectives in mind at all times. Also, studying a social science teaches you quite quickly that â€œtruthâ€� is a construct, and that everything should be deeply and intentionally inspected before you act on it â€” just like this piece of advice ;)</p><h2 id="how-do-you-balance-the-hustle-and-wellness"><br>How do you balance the hustle and wellness?</h2><p><br>Digital detox vacations and no-screen time blocking have helped me. Taking long walks, best daily, also allows me to unwind and keep my mind â€œaired out.â€� I am always thinking about something work-related, so reading fiction can help pulling myself out of the constant state of working.</p><p>I am a great fan of the Pet Shop Boys. For some reason, their style of pop and dance music just makes me very happy. I often listen to their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/56Z44BHAMa9GUhHYRyyetP?si=Cz6tFZvdS0Ky1sswaiz_Ww">extensive discography</a> when I need to think.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="closing-question-what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-makers-out-there"><br>Closing question: What advice would you give to other makers out there?</h2><p>Read books. Listen to podcasts. Ask questions. Learn in public. Examine any piece of advice you get, understand where itâ€™s coming from and if it makes sense for you. Donâ€™t fall for promises of quick riches, building a sustainable business takes time. Forge relationships with your audience, understand that theyâ€™re not just your customers, they are the reason for your business to exist.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I found my old Eee PC 901 at the bottom of a drawer sitting and
collecting dust. It served me well a decade ago and I still have fond memories
of it, but by modern standard it's really obsolete as a laptop. With Intel Atom
N270 and 2GB DDR2 RAM at its heart, I'm not sure it'll win over even Raspberry
Pi 4. Yet it is in a good working condition, and I couldn't bring myself to
discard it into the trash bin.</p>
<p>At a peak of its popularity Eee PC family was very popular in the
hacking/modding community, so I went on to see if there's something cool I can
do with it. I've never really messed with hardware before, so even if it doesn't
work out, I'll learn something useful from it.</p>
<p>In this post I'll document interfaces that exist on Eee PC 901 motherboard and
present interest for modding. Kudos to the Eee PC community who reverse
engineered all of this, I'll try to cite original sources to the best of my
ability, but internet archeology is hard, so apologies if I misidentify any.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most useful sources were the ASUS original
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ASUS+P901+Rev1.3G+Schematic+Diagram.pdf">motherboard schematics</a>
and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=asus_p901_rev_1.3g_boardview.zip">component layout</a>,
which you can find with a little bit of googling. I also relied heavily on
postinga at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121129075421/http://forum.eeeuser.com/index.php?showforum=26">eeeuser.com</a>
(down and gone, but mostly available through web archive),
<a href="http://eee-pc.ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3:%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F">eee-pc.ru</a>
(which is also frequently down) and <a href="http://jkkmobile.com/">jkkmobile.com</a>. Some
specifics about supported protocol versions were found in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023163054/https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Intel_mobileatomn270singlecoredatasheet.pdf">Intel Atom N270 datasheet</a>
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023162941/https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/datasheet/i-o-controller-hub-7-datasheet.pdf">Intel ICH7-M datasheet</a>
(south bridge). I also found helpful notes at ivc.no
<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/Eee_PC_Internal_Upgrades">1</a>,
<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/Eee_PC_Research">2</a>, although they focus on
Eee PC <strong>7</strong>01.</p>
<p>Use this information at your own risk! I did my best to cross-check the information between sources, but I haven't tried any of this myself yet!</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>IDE (PATA) master + slave, up to 100 MB/s via <code>IDE1</code>, <code>IDE2</code> connectors (ASUS
proprietary <code>FLASH_CON</code>) and <code>IDE3</code> (ZIF-40).</li>
<li>2x SATA 2.0, up to 300 MB/s each via <code>IDE1</code> and <code>IDE2</code> connectors
(<code>FLASH_CON</code>).</li>
<li>2x PCI-E 1x 1.0a, up to 250 MB/s each via <code>3GCARD</code> and <code>MINICARD</code> connectors
(mini PCI-E).</li>
<li>8x USB 2.0, up to 60 MB/s. 3 external USB Type A, 2 internal via <code>IDE2</code> and
<code>3GCARD</code>, 2 internal motherboard connectors (<code>BLT_CON</code> and <code>CAMERA</code>).</li>
<li>Other stuff like internal audio, SPI, ELPC (<code>DEBUG_CON</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ide1-and-ide2-flash-con">IDE1 and IDE2 (FLASH_CON)</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: ASUS crammed all possible mass storage buses into a single proprietary
interface. It is incompatible with either mini PCI-E spec or mSATA, despite
sharing the mechanical socket.</strong></p>
<p>In Eee PC 901 they are used to connect the 5mm, 4 GB internal SSD (IDE1) and the
more easily accessible 7mm, 16 GB secondary SSD (IDE2). The same interface was
used for internal storage in most other models.</p>
<p>These two are the most notorious in the hacking community for the amount of
confusion and wasted money they are responsible for 😅 Mechanically they are
identical to mini PCI-E and mSATA interfaces, but aren't really compatible with
either. They are loosely inspired by mini PCI-E, but ASUS engineers liberally
rewired them to their own needs.</p>
<p>The complete pinout was

by eeeuser.com member <em>CyberKareca</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yellow, orange and light violet pads are parts of IDE/PATA bus, which is
shared between all IDE1-3 connectors (more on it later). <em>tie2</em> (eeeuser.com)
published instructions
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421072808/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?pid=183442#p183442">connecting CompactFlash to it</a>
(<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/eee/EeePC_Hack_withinCF_E_.pdf">pdf</a>) using the IDE bus.</li>
<li>The blue <code>USB_D±</code> pads are indeed the USB bus, which is about the only thing
compatible with mini PCI-E standard, apart from <code>GND</code>. Sadly only IDE2
connector has them functional on the 901 model.</li>
<li>Most notable are the light-blue pads, which carry a proper SATA data bus
signals. Unlike the IDE bus IDE1 and 2 have independent SATA buses, which
appear to be usable at the same time and independently from IDE. Eee-pc.ru
wiki has a nice instruction on
<a href="http://eee-pc.ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3:sata">connecting 2.5” SATA disks</a>
to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So <code>FLASH_CON</code> is more like “the ultimate mass storage interface” than mini
PCI-E. Unfortunately, they are most often referred to as ASUS mini PCI-E,
causing incredible confusion for people looking to upgrade EEE PC's slow SSDs,
but this is easily a whole separate post…</p>
<h3 id="ide3">IDE3</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A standard, slow and boring ZIF-40 PATA port on the same bus as IDE1
and 2.</strong></p>
<p>This is <code>FLASH_CON</code>'s little brother which only includes IDE/PATA bus organized
as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_insertion_force#Hard_disk_drives">ZIF-40 connector</a>.
The connector was soldered-on in 901's earlier batches, but in later revisions
was left as bare soldering pads. This connector format was popular with compact
1.8” drives prior to SATA, and there are still some offerings available. Pin
arrangement is basically the same as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA">40-pin PATA ribbon cable</a>.</p>
<p>jkkmobile published a guide for connecting an
<a href="http://www.jkkmobile.com/2008/07/how-to-add-more-storage-to-asus-eee-pc.html">hdd or CompactFlash</a>
to this slot, although these days it's far more practical to use SATA-based
solutions.</p>
<p>Because IDE1, IDE2 and IDE3 ports all use the same physical bus, only two can
actually have a device connected at the same time via <em>PATA</em> protocol. However,
as far as I can tell it should be possible to have two SATA devices connected to
IDE 1 and 2, and a PATA drive to IDE 3. Practicality of this approach is
questionable, however, side 1.8” PATA ZIF drives are slow and hard to come by.
Using <code>FLASH_CON</code> to mSATA adapters is a much easier way to get a fast and
high-capacity storage without any soldering.</p>
<h3 id="3gcard">3GCARD</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A regular mini PCI-E slot, requires soldering to make use of it in most
901s.</strong></p>
<p>This slot is not soldered-on in all Eee PC 901 versions except the “901 GO”
variant with a 3G modem onboard.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>FLASH_CON</code>, this is an actual mini PCI-E interface, compatible
mechanically and electrically. Unfortunately, in non-GO versions not only you
have to solder the socket on, but also
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110323015910/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?pid=684627#p684627">bridge a few connections</a>
on the motherboard to get USB and PCI-E lines functional (credit to the
eeeuser.com member <em>hoarkus</em>, who also managed to connect
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom_Crystal_HD">Broadcom Crystal HD</a> video
decoder to this slot). Internet has little information about the state of this
port in the “GO” version, but I expect it is more functional out of box.</p>
<p><em>jkkmobile</em> posted instructions for
<a href="http://www.jkkmobile.com/2008/09/how-to-internal-3g-hsdpa-on-asus-eee-pc.html">installing 3g modem into a non-GO 901</a>.
Notably, the lines leading to the SIM slot seem to be intact in all revisions,
which is very nice. Surprisingly, this is sort of compatible with the mini PCI-E
spec, which reserves pins 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 for connection with a SIM module,
although without specifying exact purposes of each pin.</p>
<p>Curiously, the schematics marks pins 39, 41 and 43 as related to GPS which, to
my knowledge, never shipped on 901 models. It appears ASUS engineers wanted to
have a 5v source available to the just in case, so <strong>(warning, untested!)</strong>
shorting this contact puts 5v onto pin 39:</p>

  
    
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Short these contacts to get +5v on 3GCARD pin 39. The place is top-left of the SD card reader in the topside of the motherboard.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    
  

<p>This could be handy if you are designing your own PCB to go into the slot or
want to connect a regular USB device trough this slot.</p>
<h3 id="minicard">MINICARD</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A functional mini PCI-E connector, but without the USB lines.</strong></p>
<p>I almost wrote this this is, for once, a standard-compliant mini PCI-E port, but
alas, the <code>USB_D±</code> pins are not connected, even though they should be by the
spec. But the rest of the interface is functional, including the PCI-E 1x line,
which is nice.</p>
<p>This slot is normally occupied by the WiFi adapter, which is kinda essential and
therefore didn't gain too much attention from the modder community. However,
there are loads of interesting things one could try and plug into a spare mini
PCI-E slot: high-performance network adapter, SATA controller or even external
GPU 🤪 Might be worth the hassle of replacing the stock WiFi adapter with a USB
one.</p>
<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: there are at least 4 internal USB lines one could use, but all require
some soldering.</strong></p>
<p>USB ports are bread and butter for connecting extra bells and whistles to Eee
PCs. Obviously, there are 3 external ports, which aren't very convenient for
internal mods. In addition there are a few more internal that could be
repurposed for various needs.</p>
<p>I already mentioned above that IDE2 and 3GCARD have USB data lines on pins 36
and 38, which aren't used by anything (at least in non-GO versions) and can be
repurposed without a sacrifice. You'll have to route 5v and GND from someplace
else, though.</p>
<p>Next there's BlueTooth adapter, which is probably the next-best trade for
something cool. It uses a 10-pin connector, most of which are used for
uninteresting stuff like toggling the radio on an off. For modding purposes the
more interesting pins are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 — <code>GND</code>.</li>
<li>2 — <code>USB_D+</code>.</li>
<li>3 — <code>USB_D-</code>.</li>
<li>8 — <code>+3v</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next option is webcam's connector, which has all the standard USB leads:
<code>GND</code>, <code>USB_D+</code>, <code>USB_D-</code> and <code>+5v</code>. They seem the be using
<code>SM04B-SRSS-TB(LFSN)</code> PCB header for it, so potentially you could connect
through it without soldering on the motherboard. Also this is the only internal
USB port with 5v on it.</p>
<p>Technically, there's also the SD card reader, which also has USB data lines, but
they are routed in a really inaccessible way, so it's better to leave it alone
😑</p>
<p>As a side note, it is possible to cram a USB hub board into Eee PC to get even
more ports, and I read reports of people doing it with 701 models.</p>
<h3 id="internal-audio">Internal audio</h3>
<p>I wasn't able to find reliable information, but <code>MIC</code> (internal microphone)
connector seems to be a digital protocol, probably
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a>. If you feel
adventurous, motherboard schematics is your friend.</p>
<p>Internal <code>SPEAKERS</code>, in opposite, are a straightforward analog stereo signal.</p>
<h3 id="spi">SPI</h3>
<p>SPI is a well-known interface that is used for things like recovering from
really bad BIOS update mishaps. The only relevant material for EEE PC 901 I
found was a detailed posting by eeeuser.com member <em>naviathan</em>, who managed to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100625213932/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=79049">re-flash BOIS using another linux machine</a>.
I really hope I won't need it 😅</p>
<h3 id="debug-con">DEBUG_CON</h3>
<p>Again, very little information about it but it appears to be a motherboard
self-diagnostics …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
			
<p>So, I’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/_jan_schulte_/status/1315482456649355265?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking with many software agency owners</a> lately. A common theme in these conversations was always <em>“How do I acquire new clients?”</em>, “Why are prospects not listening to me? When we talk about software development, software developers can relate. They want to work with us, but decision-makers don’t care.”</p>



<p>Can you relate to this? Have you seen this too?</p>



<p>I think it’s essential for you to as well to develop these new customers, right? But what should you do when decision-makers, the C-Level Suite, is not listening to you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why wouldn’t they want software development to be an essential topic in their organization?</p>



<p>Let’s examine this. Other Software Developers listen to you because you speak their language. You can relate to their challenges, how hard it is for them to deliver, how messy deployments are, and that it’s about time to establish more best practices across the team.</p>



<p>But still, why do C-Level folks not care about this? They benefit from that too! Correct. Indirectly, they benefit from more best practices, such as pair programming or code reviews. Indirectly? Software Developers have specific goals. To deliver the new release, fix bugs, and set up reliable workflows. All these goals pay into the overall mission of providing value for their end-users and ensuring its success.</p>



<p>On the other hand, C-Level folks have the same overarching mission, running a successful company, but their concrete goals are different. Whereas a Software developer may measure success based on metrics such as feature work completed in a sprint, or new bug reports per month, the CTO’s and CEO’s look at a different dashboard.</p>



<p>For them, metrics such as ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), decreased costs, and increased team efficiency without hiring new people are essential. That’s how their success is measured.</p>



<p>Now, my question for you is: How do your offerings relate to these metrics? If a CTO wants to decrease costs, how much money can you save them over a quarter, half a year, or a full year? How can you help a CTO to be more successful?</p>



<p>You need to take your current product or offering and tailor benefits for different personas to answer these questions:</p>



<ul><li>How does a developer benefit from your work?&nbsp;</li><li>How does your offering relate to business metrics?</li><li>How can you help CTO’s to influence their business metrics positively?</li></ul>



<p>Then, next time you conduct a discovery call or meeting with a prospect, ask for everybody’s position at the company so you can tailor your arguments and benefits toward their roles and concerns.</p>



<p>So you will demonstrate to your prospect that you understand them and their business as a whole.</p>



<p>Was this helpful? I’d love to hear from you how this strategy helped you in your business. If you need further support with crafting the right messages, get in touch via <a href="https://work-with-jan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://work-with-jan.com</a>! I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>With <a aria-label="#HacktoberFest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#HacktoberFest</a> being a thing, there has been an influx of devs desperately trying to contribute to their favorite Open-Source projects. Unfortunately, many of these pull requests have been a waste of time, with the maintainers ultimately unable to use the contributions. Maintainers don’t want to waste their time reviewing bad PRs, and contributors don’t want to waste their time writing code that will never make it into production.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some common pitfalls that developers fall prey to when working on an open-source project. As a side note, we recently open-sourced the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> front-end, so take a look<a href="https://github.com/qvault/webapp" rel="noopener"> at that</a> if you want to help out.</p>



<h2>1. Pull Requests Should Handle ONE Thing</h2>



<p>Don’t open a PR like this:</p>



<ul><li>Fixes bug #543</li><li>Adds new linting rules</li><li>Includes feature #456</li></ul>



<p>Your PR should do <em>one thing</em>. Small diffs decrease the cognitive load of the reviewer and make it easier to get your code into the main branch. If you have beef with multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.</p>



<h2>2. Don’t Break Consistency</h2>



<p>This one happens the most often to me in my own projects. Well-intentioned developers open pull requests with any of the following annoyances:</p>



<ul><li>Omitting semicolons in a project that prefers them</li><li>Using spaces in a project that has clearly been using tabs</li><li>Introducing snake_case in a camelCase repo</li></ul>



<p>When you contribute to an existing project, use the existing styling. No one gives two hoots about your preference on the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI" target="_blank" aria-label="tabs vs spaces (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tabs vs spaces</a>” debate in the context of this pull request.</p>



<p>If you think styling needs to change, see points #1 and #3.</p>



<h2>3. Don’t Start Work Without Approval</h2>



<p>If you hop into a Github repo and find something you don’t like, don’t immediately open a pull request. Follow these steps instead:</p>



<ul><li>Is there already an issue logged? If not, make one.</li><li>If there is an issue, reach out to the maintainers (just comment on the issue) and let them know you want to work on it, and give a quick overview of how you will address it.</li><li>Assuming you have their blessing, start work on your PR.</li></ul>



<p>This will help mitigate the creation of pointless PRs that will never be accepted on the basis of a flawed premise.</p>



<h2>4. Don’t Re-open Known Problems/Solutions</h2>



<p>Some codebases have thousands of open issues, take the <a aria-label="Go language (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/golang/go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Go language</a> project, or the <a aria-label="nocode repository (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nocode repository</a> as an example. No one wants to read your duplicate issue or review your duplicate pull request. Make sure there isn’t an existing open <em>or closed</em> issue for what you are trying to address.</p>



<h2>5. Squash Those Commits</h2>



<p>Not every project will require (or care) about <a aria-label="commit squashing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">commit squashing</a>. That said, there are no projects that require <em>not</em> squashing commits. To be on the safe side just give ’em a squash.</p>



<h2>6. Be Meaningful</h2>



<p>Rewording documentation and other frivolous changes make you look like <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">these assholes</a>. This particularly <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6075" target="_blank" aria-label="atrocious example (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">atrocious example</a> is not only scoped to pointless documentation changes but actually makes the documentation <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking to try my hand at IC decapsulation for years, and finally got
the time to do it. The process took plenty of trial and error, so this post will
document most of my failures and successes, and detail the methodologies used for
each attempt. These are most of the ICs I worked on throughout the process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/macro-all-manipulated-ics.jpg" alt="Most ICs I experimented on"></p>

<p>A typical chip is built as a silicon die, connected to its leads/contacts through
bonding wires, and encapsulated in resin for protection.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other ICs that use different designs and encapsulation
materials: mostly metal and plastics. But the epoxy-based design is extremely
common, so we’ll be focusing on it.</p>

<p>This picture of a DIP package -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DIP_package_sideview.PNG">courtesy of Wikipedia</a>-
explains it very well:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/3rd-party/DIP_package_sideview.png" alt="Generic IC diagram"></p>

<p>The decapsulation/decapping of Integrated Circuits, also known as “delidding”, is
nothing new.</p>

<p>It’s used in the industry to debug hardware issues, reverse engineer chips, verify
the authenticity of parts, and other tasks that require access to the underlying
circuitry.</p>

<p>That’s why there’s plenty of commercial services that will decapsulate your ICs
using expensive and dedicated equipment.
I’ve linked a couple of them in <a href="#resources">the bibliography</a>.
But, without having any idea how much they cost or how long they take, I can’t
imagine them being an option for the average hacker.</p>

<p>Hackers and smaller companies generally decap Integrated Circuits to identify
counterfeits, gain a very rudimentary understanding of the parts comprising them,
or just to share the pretty pictures of the silicon die.
For those cases, a DIY process is generally good enough.</p>

<p>Decapping/delidding has also been used by hackers for more fun purposes, such as
<a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=40">unsetting efuses from production hardware to extract and/or override their firmware</a>,
private keys, etc.
So there are cases where a commercial-level result can be worth it.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to try my hand at decapping ICs for years, for no other purpose
than to satiate my curiosity. I’ve finally had the time to get to it, so this
post will describe the methods I tried and the hurdles I encountered.</p>



<p>The biggest factor to decide which method is best for your project is whether
or not you need the chip to still work after it’s been decapsulated. That means
not destroying or disconnecting the die, bonding wires, external contact points,
etc. so you can still use the chip after the process is complete.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the most common options.</p>

<p>Destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.experimental-engineering.co.uk/2016/02/20/ic-decapping-the-process/">Burn the encapsulation to hell</a> using a blowtorch</li>
  <li><a href="http://jg.sn.sg/decap/">Full wet chemical decapsulation</a>: Bath the entire chip in acid to remove all encapsulation, leads, bonds, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selective wet chemical decapsulation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1707865">Rubber gaskets + acid yet for targetted decapping</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT1FStxAVz4">Manual acid deposition</a>:
Repeatedly apply drops of acid on the IC’s target area, and rinse the acid
residue and weakened encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://bseteq.com/decapsulation/plasma-decap/plaser-plasma-decapsulation-system/">Plasma etching</a>
uses expensive equipment to create plasma, make it react with the encapsulation,
and drain it away</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post we’re gonna focus on the manual acid deposition method, to achieve
non-destructive decapsulation at a reasonable cost.</p>



<p>First of all, let me preface this safety talk with an important disclaimer:
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING. My thing is firmware and electronics, not chemistry.</p>

<p>PLEASE, do not assume the safety measures discussed here are valid or enough to
protect yourself. Do your own research, follow any and all measures you deem
appropriate, and remain paranoid all along the process.</p>

<p>We’re dealing with very dangerous chemicals. If you decide to replicate the
experiments it’s at your own peril.</p>

<p>Here are more authoritative sources of safety information for a project like this.
Review as much of this info as you can, and take it with the seriousness it requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/safetynet/safe-use-of-nitric-acid">UCDavis docs on the safe use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/safety-centers-of-expertise-us/respiratory-protection/respirator-selection/">3M respiratory protection selection guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nitric-acid/default.html">CDC resources on the use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftACSEJ6DZA">NileRed’s “Chemistry is Dangerous” introduction to personal protection when working with chemicals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After doing enough research to feel comfortable with the risks involved, I settled
for following these measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run all experiments outside, with all nearby windows closed, and never accessing
the area without using PPE. I might invest in a fume hood in the future, either
commercial or DIY</li>
  <li>Wear chemical splash goggles. They should protect your eyes from droplets
coming from any direction. If they become uncomfortable or fog up, do not remove
them or pull them off your face in the working area</li>
  <li>Wear a respirator mask with filters that are appropriate for chemical fumes.
Preferably a full face mask, to avoid acid splashes</li>
  <li>Wear gloves that are appropriate for the acids you’re dealing with. Nitrile gloves
should NOT be used to work with nitric acid; especially fuming (98%+) nitric acid.
Long, thick neoprene-based gloves are best for Nitric, but make delicate tasks
difficult. I settled for wearing a thick neoprene glove on my non-dominant hand,
and a vinyl glove on my dominant hand for the more delicate work. When touching
any surface that’s hot or has been in touch with acid, I use the neoprene glove</li>
  <li>Expose as little of your skin as possible: Wear shoes, trousers (not shorts),
long sleeves… Preferably use a lab coat, so you can remove the acid-splashed
clothing without dragging it over your face</li>
  <li>Never mix chemicals without fully understanding the outcome to expect. Keep
different chemicals as far apart from each other as possible. Keep the smallest
possible amount of dangerous chemicals in the working area</li>
  <li>Be prepared for the worst:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep enough sodium bicarbonate at hand to neutralize acid spills and leftover acid.
Keep in mind that neutralizing acid with bicarb will give off heat, and the bubbling
could be dangerously vigorous for significant amounts. Expect the possibility of
a spill during the neutralization process</li>
      <li>Keep enough water at hand to dilute chemicals in case of spills, splashes, etc.</li>
      <li>Understand what are the recommended procedures in case of any given chemical
contacting your skin, eyes, etc. Eyes are generally the most sensitive to chemical
splashes, as they can be permanently damaged in seconds; they’re also the most
difficult to clean up, so be particularly careful with them and have a plan of
action in case the worst happens</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/ppe.jpg" alt="Picture of my PPE"></p>



<p>These describe failures and successes, and what I learned along the way.
Keep in mind that most resources I’ve found recommend using fuming nitric acid
(86%+).</p>

<p>I was not able to source fuming nitric acid, so I used concentrated nitric
(69%) instead. That could account for some of the problems I’m about to describe,
but worked fine once I found the most fitting methodology.</p>



<p>Chemicals I used during my experiments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Concentrated (69%) Nitric Acid</li>
  <li>100% Sodium bicarbonate - Bought on Amazon</li>
  <li>98% methanol - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Acetone - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Water - Either tap water or regular distilled water from a grocery store</li>
</ol>

<p>I also ran a couple of tests using Sulfuric Acid, both standalone and mixed with
the Nitric, but the results were not very promising. Probably because of the
encapsulation material used in my ICs. These are the acids I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/all-chemicals.jpg" alt="Both bottles of acid used during my experiments"></p>

<p>Necessary equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dremel
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve found <a href="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/dremel-diamond-pointy-bit.jpg">this off-brand pointy diamond bit</a>
to work great</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hot plate</li>
  <li>High-temperature and acid safe recipient
    <ul>
      <li>Tried using ceramic recipients and they worked well enough, but it was hard
to maintain a stable temperature outside using my hot plate</li>
      <li>Graphite ingot molds ended up being better at conducting heat (hence
maintaining a reasonably stable temperature outside) and providing easy access
to the IC inside</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plastic tweezers</li>
  <li>A syringe, or preferably an assortment of them</li>
</ol>

<p>Other very useful equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Erlenmeyer flask to keep a small amount of acid in a stable container</li>
  <li>Pipettes:
    <ul>
      <li>10ml pipette to transfer acid from its primary container to the flask</li>
      <li>1ml pipette to drop acid on the ICs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beakers:
    <ul>
      <li>A small one for acetone</li>
      <li>A large one for water, to rinse tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thermocouple to monitor the temperature of the hot plate and IC container</li>
  <li>Tongs to move the hot ceramic/graphite container</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic cleaner. Explained later</li>
</ol>

<p>This picture shows most of the equipment used for the most successful method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/ultrasonic-acetone-all-equipment.jpg" alt="All the equipment used for the most successful method"></p>

<h2 id="attempt-1-sand-down-the-epoxy-packaging">Attempt 1: Sand down the epoxy packaging</h2>

<p>This is how the project started. I just got a new microscope, met with a couple
of good friends, and we started looking at some random samples. Blood, dust, etc.</p>

<p>Then we decided to take a look at some random IC. We were not looking to
see anything useful or complete; just an overall image of the silicon die in
an IC, so I sanded down a microcontroller and we took a look. The result, as
expected, was absolute garbage:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/macro-sanded-pic.jpg" alt="Macro: Sanded down IC"></p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/micro-sanded-pic.jpg" alt="Micro: Sanded down silicon die"></p>

<p>Well, that went exactly as terribly as expected… Time to go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2-dremel--69-nitric-acid--gentle-acetone-bath">Attempt 2: Dremel + 69% Nitric Acid + Gentle acetone bath</h2>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drill a pocket on the top of the epoxy package so the acid does not spill over
to the leads.</li>
  <li>Place IC on a ceramic or graphite recipient, on top of the hot plate. Attach
a thermocouple to the recipient to monitor its temperature</li>
  <li>When the temperature is appropriate (around 100 degrees C), drop one or 2 drops
of acid in the epoxy pocket we just drilled. Wait until there is no more acid,
and continue to apply acid when that happens</li>
  <li>Every once in a while, grab the IC with plastic tweezers, dip it in acetone
and move it around to remove the reacted epoxy</li>

<p>In 2015 I wrote a paper called “<a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/allen_downey.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Millennials Ever Get Married?</a>” where I used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to estimate the age at first marriage for women in the U.S, broken down by decade of birth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I found that women born in the 1980s and 90s were getting married later than previous cohorts, and I generated projections that suggest they are on track to stay unmarried at substantially higher rates.</p>



<p>Here are the results from that paper, based on 58 488 women surveyed between 1983 to 2015:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-3-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each line represents a cohort grouped by decade of birth.  For example, the top line represents women born in the 1940s.</p>



<p>The colored segments show the fraction of women who had ever been married as a function of age.  For example, among women born in the 1940s, 82% had been married by age 25.  Among women born in the 1980s, only 41% had been married by the same age.</p>



<p>The gray lines show projections I generated by assuming that going forward each cohort would be subject to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#Hazard_function_and_cumulative_hazard_function">hazard function</a> of the previous cohort. This method is likely to overestimate marriage rates.</p>



<p>These results show two trends:</p>



<ul><li>Each cohort is getting married later than the previous cohort.</li><li>The fraction of women who never marry is increasing from one cohort to the next.  </li></ul>



<h3>New data</h3>



<p>Yesterday the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) released a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2017_2019_puf.htm" target="_blank">new batch of data from surveys conducted in 2017-2019</a>. &nbsp;So we can compare the predictions from 2015 with the new data, and generate updated predictions.</p>



<p>The following figure shows the predictions from the previous figure, which are based on data up to 2015, compared to the new curves based on data up to 2019, which includes 70 183 respondents.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2019, <br>compared to predictions based on data up to 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For women born in the 1980s, the fraction who have married is almost exactly as predicted.  For women born in the 1990s, it is substantially lower.  </p>



<h3>New projections</h3>



<p>The following figure shows projections based on data up to 2019.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2019,<br>with predictions based on data up to 2019.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The vertical dashed lines show the ages where we have the last reliable estimate for each cohort.  The following table summarizes the results at age 28:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 28</td><td>87%</td><td>80%</td><td>70%</td><td>63%</td><td>55%</td><td>31%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 28, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The percentage of women married by age 28 has dropped quickly from each cohort to the next, by about 11 percentage points per decade.  </p>



<p>The following table shows the same percentage at age 38; the last value, for women born in the 1990s, is a projection based on the data we have so far.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 38</td><td>92%</td><td>88%</td><td>85%</td><td>80%</td><td>68%</td><td><em>51%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 38, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect barely half of women born in the 1990s to be married before age 38.</p>



<p>Finally, here are the percentages of women married by age 48; the last two values are projections.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 48</td><td>&gt;93%</td><td>&gt;90%</td><td>88%</td><td>83%</td><td><em>72%</em></td><td><em>58%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 48, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect women born in the 1980s and 1990s to remain unmarried at rates substantially higher than previous generations.</p>



<p>Projections like these are based on the assumption that the future will be like the past, but of course, things change.  In particular:</p>



<ul><li>These data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. Marriage rates in 2020 will probably be lower than predicted, and the effect could continue into 2021 or beyond.</li><li>However, as economic conditions improve in the future, marriage rates might increase.</li></ul>



<p>We’ll find out when we get the next batch of data in October 2022.</p>

<p>A few months back, a controversy resurfaced in the world of tech. The controversy centered on the use of language and history at <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/problem-putting-worlds-code-github/">the world’s largest repository for open-source code</a>, GitHub. Developers from around the world had begun to reiterate their opposition to the default “master” branch convention GitHub used in its version control system. This month, after years of inaction, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-in-october-what-developers-need-to-know/">GitHub will officially change its default branch names from master to main</a>. To many, this change is long overdue. But to a significant number of people, the change is unnecessary. Because GitHub does not expressly use the word “slave” in its architecture, these developers argue, the use of master is anodyne. <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx">Message boards are still filled with commentators arguing this very point.</a> If the issue of master branches and version control systems confuses you, you’re not alone. In Part I (On Git, GitHub and Master-Slave) more context is given into what can be obscure subjects, providing an explanation as to what GitHub is and how the term “master” has been applied in version control systems.</p>

<p>For now, what can be said is that, despite <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">GitHub having decided to transition to other terminology</a>, a slim few in either party have gone so far as to write about the history of these words as applied to technology. If they had, they would have found that, as far as we know, master-slave language had only entered technological vernacular in the 20th century. Part II (Master-Slave in the 20th Century) elaborates on the best available research to be found on the history of master-slave terminology in the engineering and technological fields during the 20th century. Relying on keywords in patents, I review evidence into what might be the first modern use of master-slave terminology in the engineering context. I also explore which scientific fields began and continue to use “master-slave” terminology.</p>

<p>To truly understand how master-slave terminology could have emerged, requires a deeper exploration of history. For that reason, in Part III (<em>Dominus Machina</em>—The Scientific Revolution and Hierarchical Thinking) a more extensive review of the Scientific Revolution is made. Here I explore how socio-economic uncertainties during the 16th and 17th centuries laid the groundwork for a new hierarchical philosophy, promulgated by popular thinkers such as Sir Francis Bacon, in which man (in the gendered sense) had the divine right to dominate and enslave the earth for the purpose of progress and the accumulation of knowledge. This hierarchical thinking was adapted throughout the centuries to fit contemporaneous social beliefs. From racial hierarchies to anthropometry, phrenology, and Social Darwinism, dominance terminology and hierarchical thinking that emerged in the 17th century had become a tradition of the academic and technological sectors of the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>After reading this essay, I hope it becomes clear why master and master-slave terminology continues to be used in 2020. This post is not meant to rehash a debate about the use of master and master-slave branching. Frankly, it seems clear that the terms should never have been used. Neither is this post meant to characterize all hierarchical thinking as evil. Instead, the aim of this essay is to, respectfully, establish a fuller contextual history about the development of “master-slave” terminology in tech, and hierarchical thought in the sciences more generally. This is a difficult task because there is large portion of history to cover. In this essay, I concentrate on the roots of master-slave terminology in science which comes at the expense of more modern history. In the future, I hope to write more about our recent past.<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> More importantly, however, is that this topic matters deeply to many individuals—as it should. It is my hope that I have chosen my words respectfully and made my points accurately. To properly grasp the essence of this history, however, one must first understand the core service GitHub provides.</p>



<p>In the course of a program’s existence, developers often make many iterative changes to their code. Sometimes a change in the code will break the program, or a function, or a feature therein. In such cases, it is often helpful to have access to a previous, working version of the code in which to revert. For this and many other reasons,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> there exists the concept of <strong>version control</strong>—the recording and management of changes to code and documents.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> Since 2005 a primary tool for version control has been <strong>Git</strong>—a decentralized version control system (“Distributed Version Control”) in which the historical ledger of program alterations are retained by both remote and local servers. Soon after its open-source release, Git became the most used version control system in the world.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Helping in the ascent of Git was GitHub.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup> Established in 2008, GitHub provided developers using Git’s open-source software a means to host their code in remote repositories—libraries of files and documents—for free, while adding useful features like the ability to collaborate with other developers on the same projects. It also provided premium benefits to commercial ventures. Riding a wave of Big Data integration and open-source use throughout the 2010’s, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-15/github-said-to-seek-2-billion-valuation-in-latest-financing">by 2015 it was estimated that GitHub was worth $2 billion</a>. In 2018 the company was acquired by Microsoft for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/">$7.5 billion in Microsoft stock</a>.</p>



<p>In acquiring GitHub, however, Microsoft also inherited its customs. A key feature of Git, and of GitHub by proxy, is how information is stored. The initial “commit” of data to a repository creates a tree, or hierarchy, of information “snapshots” which are pointed to by a reference variable (called a HEAD). From this tree begins an initial development “branch” under which each new commit of information is stored. In Git, and GitHub, this first branch (there can be many branches) is by default given the name “master.” As the initial branch to each project, the “master branch” has to many become tied to the idea of storing their information hierarchically in GitHub.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup> And there’s the rub: for the common use of master to many people—especially people of color—evokes a shameful period in American history and breeds an atmosphere of intolerance and inequality <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">in an already unrepresentative field</a>.</p>

<p>So, is it true? Is the etymological root of master, in this context, oppressive in nature? Working against an anodyne interpretation of master is the common use of “master-slave” terminology in much of the technology sector—context that is often <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">conveniently omitted from justifications about the use of master.</a> For example, it does not take much research to discover that the creator of Git, Linus Torvalds, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">is known to have sourced the inspiration of Git from a commercial version-control system called BitKeeper</a>. BitKeeper <a href="https://github.com/bitkeeper-scm/bitkeeper/blob/master/doc/HOWTO.ask#L223">calls its branches and repositories masters and slaves</a>.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> True, there are no “slave” conventions used in Git or GitHub, but this does not indemnify either from their reliance upon the use of master—it simply implies that those who use the term are ignorant of its origin.</p>



<p>For some, this reasoning will fall short: yes, the root of master in Git may originate with the master-slave paradigm, but it is no longer used in this sense—so let’s move on. Commonly left out of this reasoning, however, is an answer to the following question: why use master-slave terminology at all? Why do GitHub, BitKeeper, or any other company for that matter rely on such terms? And, who started using such terminology? To this last question, some have sought an answer. It turns out the use of these specific terms seems to have emerged only in the quite recent past.</p>



<p>In 2007, a fascinating article was published out of the University of Michigan. The article, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236752849_Broken_Metaphor_The_Master-Slave_Analogy_in_Technical_Literature">“Broken Metaphor: The Master-Slave Analogy in Technical Literature”</a>, had a simple conceit: to explore the history of master-slave terminology by studying patents throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The article’s author, Ron Eglash, a professor of ethnomathematics, had a wider focus than <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-photo-preview-algorithmic-racial-bias/">current hot-button issues such as algorithmic bias</a>. Practitioners of the field of <strong>ethnomathematics</strong> like Eglash study the etymology and social interactivity between mathematics and culture throughout the world. In his article, Eglash was concerned not simply with the use of master-slave, but how the terms were generated.</p>



<p>As far as Eglash could tell, there were no references to master-slave terminology before the American Civil War. The earliest instance he could find occurred in a 1904 patent for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">sidereal clock</a>—a timekeeping system to locate celestial objects—by the astronomer David Gill in Cape Town, South Africa. According to the patent’s language, the clock “consists of two separate instruments: (a) a pendulum (swinging in a nearly airtight enclosure maintained at uniform temperature and pressure) and (b) the ‘slave clock’ with wheel train and dead-beat escapement.”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">8</a></sup> The association of master-slave terminology with South Africa may sound nefarious due to its history, but, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236752849_Broken_Metaphor_The_Master-Slave_Analogy_in_Technical_Literature">to Eglash, we should consider the following</a>:</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preface</h2>
<p>My goal for this article is to help you solve technical interview problems
similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate all subsets of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet of a given fixed length</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet (of any length)</li>
<li>Generate all permutations of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all combinations of a given length and a given set</li>
<li>Generate all balanced parentheses of a given length</li>
<li>Generate all binary trees with a given number of nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems fall under the category of "combinatorial generation" problems,
since you are asked to generate all the elements of a set of combinatorial
objects (subsets, strings, combinations, permutations, trees, graphs, etc.).</p>
<p>The topic of combinatorial generation is a rich field of study and here I do
not intend to do it any real justice. For rigorous and much more comprehensive
treatments of the subject I recommend Knuth's or Ruskey's books on the subject.
See the Further Reading section for references. Instead, I intend to provide
a bare minimum, approachable, and practical guide that will prepare you to
approach combinatorial generation problems you might encounter during coding
interviews, and to provide you with the basic tools and vocabulary needed to
analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.</p>
<p>I chose to write this post for several reasons. First, I noticed combinatorial
generation problems are commonly asked during coding interviews. I myself have
been asked variations of combinatorial generation problems on at least six or
seven coding interviews that I remember. I suspect their popularity as
interview questions has to do with the fact that most of the problems have
fairly simple and elegant solutions that are well within reach during a
45-minute coding interview. However, reaching any elegant solution requires
clarity of thought, good pattern recognition, a solid understanding of
recursion, as well as solid coding skills, in particular comfortable handling
of indexes, and general list or string manipulation. There are often many ways
of solving a problem, with different levels of space and time complexity
trade-off. All of this leads to a problem area that is well-suited for gauging
a candidates overall algorithmic thinking and coding aptitude.</p>
<p>Second, the topic is often not given proper treatment as part of most computer
science programs. Because of this, I noticed most candidates are somewhat
ill-prepared to solve problems in this space. While some students might have
encountered a few examples in the space as part of recursion or backtracking
topics, the problems are almost never given focused attention by themselves.
This article is meant to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Third, I believe the subject matter to be a fantastic playground for exploring
ideas and learning more about coding, combinatorics, algorithms, recursion, and
time and space complexity analysis, for reasons very similar to those making
the subject area a good fit for coding interview questions. As such,
combinatorial generation problems provide an excellent excuse to practice and
hone coding and algorithmic skills. This article is intended to be an
invitation to this playground, providing an approachable and gentle
introduction using very readable code in Python.</p>
<p>To make the post useful and practical, I start by providing a brief description
of two approaches to solving combinatorial generation problems, and then dive
into multiple examples, applying both approaches to each example and then
briefly discussing the time and space complexity of each solution. I also
provide many exercises as we progress to give you an opportunity to challenge
yourself and test your understanding of the material.</p>
<!-- I recommend you try to solve the example problems on your own before reading my -->
<!-- solutions, or at least go back and try to implement the solutions from memory -->
<!-- and based on your understanding afterwards, without looking at the source code -->
<!-- I provide. Ultimately, as Feynman said, you do not really understand it unless -->
<!-- you can create it yourself. -->

<div id="preliminaries">
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminaries</h2>
<div id="two-approaches-to-combinatorial-generation">
<h3>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Approaches To Combinatorial Generation</h3>
<p>In this post we will look at two approaches to solving combinatorial generation
problems. Let's consider both of them here briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Recursive</strong>: The problems you are likely to encounter during coding
interviews are very likely to have very simple recursive solutions. The
recursive solution is often based on simple observations about the recursive
structure of the combinatorial set you are generating. At times, the recursive
solution can be as simple as literally following the definition of the
combinatorial set. Combinatorial objects are often defined recursively, for
example, consider the definition of a binary tree. The recursive solutions
often suffer from exponential space usage (or exponential time, or both,
depending on implementation). However, they are often very very simple to
implement, requiring minimal code and are also readable and easy to understand.
As such, you should make sure you master the basic recursive solutions and
provide them as the first solution.  This way you will have at least one
working solution by the end of the interview (which will, in my experience of
interviewing candidates, set you apart from the majority of candidates).
Ideally, you should aim to provide a simple recursive solution in 5 to 10
minutes at most, leaving the majority of the rest of the interview time to
space and time complexity analysis and to provide the improved iterative
solution.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative</strong>: In the iterative approach, we move from one object to the next
by modifying the object in-place. A common iterative approach is to generate
all objects in lexicographic order. This approach has several benefits. First,
since the generation is done by modifying the input in-place, space complexity
is often constant or at least not exponential.  Second, it produces the objects
in lexicographic order, meaning the output objects are guaranteed to be in
sorted order. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as how to move from one
object to the next in lexicographic order, we can come up with a general
problem solving strategy that works for many problems. To quote Knuth,
"lexicographic order usually suggests the most convenient way to generate
combinatorial configurations" (The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 4,
section 7.2.1.3).</p>
<p>We will approach multiple example problems using both the above approaches and
analyze their time and space complexity. Hopefully by the end of the article,
both approaches will be second nature to you and provide systematic way of
approaching any combinatorial generation problem you might encounter.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-and-space-complexity-of-generation-algorithms">
<h3>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time And Space Complexity Of Generation Algorithms</h3>
<p>Time and space complexity analysis is slightly different for combinatorial
generation problems. In most cases, the output is exponential in size (or
infinite at times), and hence as a whole the program must run in exponential
time to generate all the objects (or run indefinitely until terminated
externally, in cases of generating infinite sets). Because of this, we will
often consider time needed to generate <em>each</em> object in the set (on average, or
worst case). Similarly, we will look at the maximum space needed by the program
at any point during its execution. For programs that need to run indefinitely
(i.e., ones that generate infinite sets), we look at how space usage grows as
the program keeps on running.</p>
<p>Similar to the two approaches to solving the problems, this more nuanced
approach to time and space complexity will also be made more clear by looking
at multiple examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-generate-means">
<h3>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What "Generate" Means</h3>
<p>It is important at this point to clarify what we mean by "generate". The
simplest way to generate the objects is to simply put all the output into a
list or in-memory collection of some sort and returned that collection.
However, we obviously can not improve space complexity to be better than the
size of the output set (which is often exponential), if we want to keep all the
generated objects in memory at once. Therefore, for the purposes of problems
like this, "generate" can mean any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the resulting objects all in a list and return the list.</li>
<li>Print a representation of each object to standard output.</li>
<li>Yield each object using a generator.</li>
<li>Visit each object by calling a provided <tt>visit</tt> function with the object
passed as the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, when we try to avoid unnecessary (and often exponential)
memory usage, we will use a simple generator pattern and yield each resulting
object instead of placing them in an in-memory collection. You read about
Python's generators in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">PEP 255</a>.
As the name of the pattern suggests, Python generators are very well-suited for
combinatorial generation.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-order">
<h3>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output Order</h3>
<p>A good clarifying question to ask for combinatorial generation problems is
whether there is an expectation on the order of the output objects. You might
learn that the output order does not matter, or the interviewer might ask the
output to be in lexicographic (i.e., dictionary) order. Rarely, you might also
come across a problem that asks for an order that minimizes the difference
between two subsequent objects. This order is often referred to as Gray order,
named after Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray. I hope to write a follow-up to
this post at some point to go over some examples of Gray order generation. For
now, in our basic recursive solutions we tend to not worry about the order of
the output, and just ensure every object is generated exactly once. For our
second approach, we, by definition of the approach, only generate objects in
lexicographic order.</p>

<div id="fixed-length-strings-given-an-alphabet">
<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed Length Strings Given An Alphabet</h2>
<div id="problem-definition">
<h3>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem Definition</h3>
<p>Let's start by looking at a simple problem: given an alphabet <tt>A</tt> which is
guaranteed to be a non-empty list of distinct single character strings, and a
non-negative integer <tt>n</tt>, generate all strings of length <tt>n</tt>. For
example, given <tt>A = ['0', '1', '2']</tt> and <tt>n = 2</tt> we expect the output to be:</p>

<p>To make sure the question is clear, let's look at another example. Given <tt>A =
['a', 'b']</tt> and <tt>n = 3</tt> we expect the output to be:</p>

  <h2>Does remote work mean reduced cost or increased risk? Here are some arguments about employees being ready to take a pay cut to continue working remotely. </h2>
  
  <p><img src="https://remote-tools-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Contract+negotiation.png" width="100%" max-width="700px" alt="Pay cut to work remotely"></p><p>Let me start by asking you a question. Say, your employer is ready to offer you the perk of permanent remote work but asks you to take a pay cut (5-20%), would you take it?
</p>
<p>Hanadi <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely">sparked this discussion</a> by sharing an interesting stat that 45% of UK employees are indeed ready to take a pay cut to continue working remotely.</p>

<p>Let's first look at some of the arguments for the proposal.</p><br>

<h2>1) Remote working = reduced costs. So, your net take home pay is still the same.</h2>

<p>Employers argue that remote working results in:</p>

<ul><li>Reduced transportation expenses</li>
<li>Less money spent on meals or outings with co-workers</li>
<li>Tax concessions given you have a home office</li>
<li>Reduced miscellaneous expenses like dry cleaning, wardrobe etc.</li></ul>
<p>So effectively your take-home pay is still the same or even higher.</p>
<br>
<h3>Counter</h3>
<p>
- Companies also save significant costs when employees work remotely. So looking at just reduced expenses for employees is a narrow, one-sided view.
</p>
<p>- On the contrary, individuals now have to pay extra for setting up their home office, additional bills, backup connections, co-working passes etc. So employers should in fact seriously consider reimbursing these expenses rather than thinking of a salary cut.</p>

<br><h2>2) Remote work = increased risk. The risk &amp; lack of trust is built into the pay cut and subsequent lower salary</h2>

<p>Jordan made this argument that <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_nezpjo">a remote hire comes with added risk</a>. When you hire someone who doesn't meet your standard but works in office, there's still a possibility to manage or correct that since it's easier to have constant informal contact. The bigger risk with remote working is hence built into the salary.</p>
<br>
<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>- While the argument of additional risk might be accurate, proposing a lower salary doesn't solve the root problem.</p>

<p>- Instead companies could do either of the two:</p>
<ul><li>Don't compromise on hiring. Hire only the best remotely. While companies like GitLab, Doist etc. have been doing this for years, the same may not be possible for smaller startups.
 </li>
<li>Karthik &amp; Jordan <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_fcx9cy">suggested a compromise on the same thread</a> where you negotiate a lower pay with the candidate for an initial probationary period. You also commit to a pay raise after the initial period.</li></ul>
<br>
<h3>For companies, pay cut for remote work could be a serious disadvantage</h3>

<p>Boris accurately pointed that it's <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_9wee3g">hard to convince people to switch jobs by going down in salary</a>. On the contrary, people expect at least 10-20% raise to change jobs.</p>

<p>Now, if you decide to cut down the pay of your existing employees for offering the perk of remote work, it will likely result in unhappy employees and start showing negative effects in their work.</p>

<p>Companies are seeing this all wrong when they think of lower pay in return for the benefit of working remotely. Sure it's a perk for employees but that shouldn't mean a compromise elsewhere. Instead companies should push employees to bring out the best version of themselves &amp; perform even better now that employees have this additional freedom.</p>

<p>Microsoft's new remote work policy actually gets this right. Read <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/r7pmum/simple_is_powerful">more about it here</a>.</p>

<p>I am sure you would have something to add to these arguments. <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely">Head over to this thread</a> to share your thoughts.</p>

<title>The Myth of RAM, part I</title>
# The Myth of RAM, part I
<p id="date">April 21, 2014</p>


## Preface
This article is the first of four in a series, in which I argue that thinking of a memory access as _O(1)_ is generally a bad idea, and we should instead think of them as taking _O(√N)_ time. In part one I lay out a hand-wavy argument based on a benchmark. In [part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html) I build up a mathematical argument based in theoretical physics, and in [part III](2014_04_29_myth_of_ram_3.html) I investigate some implications. [Part IV](2015_02_09_myth_of_ram_4.html) is a FAQ in which I answers some common questions and misunderstandings.

(This preface was added on August 29, 2016)


## Intro
If you have studied computing science, then you know how to do [complexity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms#Run-time_analysis). You'll know that the time complexity for iterating through a linked list is _O(N)_, binary search is _O(log(N))_ and a hash table lookup is _O(1)_. What if I told you that all of the above is not just misleading, but wrong? What if I told you that the time it takes to iterate through a linked list is actually _O(N√N)_ and hash lookups are _O(√N)_?

Don't believe me? By the end of this series of articles you will. I will show you that accessing memory is not a _O(1)_ operation but _O(√N)_. This is a result that holds up both in theory and practice. Let’s start with the latter:



## Measuring it
First of all, let's get our definitions straight. [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) can be applied to many things, from memory usage to instructions executed. For the purpose of this series of articles I'll be using the _O(f(N))_ to mean that _f(N)_ is an upper bound (worst case) of the *time* it takes to accomplish a task accessing _N_ bytes of memory (or, equivalently, _N_ number of equally sized elements). That I use Big O to analyze _time_ and not _operations_ is important. As we'll see, the CPU spends a lot of time waiting for memory. Personally, I do not care what the CPU does while I wait for it – I only care about how long something takes, hence the definition above.

Another clarification: the "RAM" in the title is meant to refer to random memory accesses in general, not to a specific type of memory. In this installment I measure the time it takes to access a piece of memory be it in cache, in DRAM, or in swap. In Part II I will extend this even further – but I'm getting ahead of myself.

[Here’s a simple program](https://github.com/emilk/ram_bench) that iterates through a linked list of length _N_, ranging from 64 elements up to about 420 million elements. Each node consists of a 64 bit pointer and 64 bits of dummy data. The nodes of the linked list are jumbled around in memory so that each memory access is random. I measure iterating through the same list a few times, and then plot the time taken per element. This means that we should get a flat plot if random memory access is _O(1)_. This is what we actually get:

![The cost of accessing one node in a linked list of a given size. Accessing a random element in a 100MB list is approximately 100 times slower than accessing an element in a 10kB list.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/1_data.png)

Note that this is a log-log graph, so the differences are actually pretty huge. We go from about one nanosecond per element all they way up to a microsecond! But why? The answer, of course, is caching. The system memory (RAM) is actually pretty slow and far away and so to compensate the clever computer designers have added a hierarchy of faster, closer and more expensive caches to speed things up. My computer has three levels called L1, L2, L3 of 32 kiB, 256 kiB and 4 MiB each. I have 8 GiB of RAM, but when I ran my experiment I only had about 6 GiB free – so in the last runs there was some swapping to disk (an SSD). Here’s the same plot again but with my RAM and cache sizes added as vertical lines:

![The vertical lines corresponds to L1=32kiB, L2=256kiB, L3=4MiB and 6 GiB of free RAM.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/2_caches.png)

This graph should really drive home the importance of cache:s – each cache is many times faster than the previous one. This is the reality of modern CPU architectures, be it on smartphones, laptops or mainframes. But what is the pattern? Can we fit some simple equation to the plot? It turns out we can! If you look at the plot you'll see that between 10kB and 1MB there is a roughly a 10x slowdown. Between 1 MB and 100 MB there is another 10x slowdown – and again between 100 MB and 10 GB! It seems like that for each 100-fold increase in memory usage we get a 10-fold slow-down. Let's superimpose that on the graph:

![The blue line is _O(√N)_.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/3_fit.png)

The blue line corresponds to a _O(√N)_ cost of each memory access. Seems like a pretty good fit, no? Of course this is on my machine, and it may look quite different on yours. Still, the equation is very simple to remember, so maybe we could use it as a rule of thumb.

You may now wonder what will happen once we hit the right side of the graph. Will it keep climbing, or plateauing? Well, it would plateau for a while until we could no longer fit the memory on SSD and would need to go to HDD, then a disk server, then a data-center far away etc. Each such jump would create a new plateau, but the upwards trend of the latency, I will argue, would continue. The reason I did not run my experiment further is simply lack of time and lack of access to a big data-center.

"But", I hear you say, "empiricism is no way to establish a Big-O bound!". It certainly isn't! Could there perhaps be a theoretical limit to the latency of a memory access? The plot thickens in [The Myth of RAM, part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html).

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

    <blockquote>
  <p>If at first you don’t succeed, call it version 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RuboCop’s development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947">the first
commit</a>
on April 21, 2012. That’s a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we’ve racked up some
impressive numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9905</strong> commits</li>
  <li><strong>152</strong> releases</li>
  <li>around <strong>3500</strong> closed issues</li>
  <li>almost <strong>5000</strong> merged pull requests</li>
  <li>over <strong>120 million</strong> downloads</li>
  <li>over <strong>200</strong> publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)</li>
  <li>over <strong>700</strong> contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there’s a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that’d be me. But wait, there’s more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq">RuboCop HQ organization</a> that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions</li>
  <li>Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-rails</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-performance</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-ast</code>)</li>
  <li>Created new extensions focused on Rake (<code>rubocop-rake</code>) and Minitest (<code>rubocop-minitest</code>)</li>
  <li>Made significant improvements to RuboCop’s code formatting capabilities</li>
  <li>Reworked the cop API</li>
  <li>Switched to safe-only cops by default</li>
  <li>Introduced the notion of “pending” cops</li>
  <li>Created a brand new <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">documentation site</a></li>
  <li>Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">https://rubystyle.guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing eluded us, though - a “stable” RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it’s almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
“pending” are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.</p>

<p>The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we’re finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling of new cops</li>
  <li>changes to the default cop configuration</li>
  <li>breaking API changes</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html">I first spoke</a>
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?</p>

<p>Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It’s not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for “we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision”.  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop’s team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn’t easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn’t stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.</p>

<p>I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I’d immediately respond to it, now I can’t
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can’t keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I’ll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it’s
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I’ve just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.</p>

<p>I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop’s core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jonas054">Jonas Arvidsson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama">Yuji Nakayama</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/edzhelyov">Evgeni Dzhelyov</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/drenmi">Ted Johansson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pocke">Masataka Kuwabara</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koic">Koichi Ito</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/darhazer">Maxim Krizhanovski</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bquorning">Benjamin Quorning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcandre">Marc-André Lafortune</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You rock, guys!</p>

<p>Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It’s a long story for another day and another article.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like <code>rubocop-rails</code>, <code>rubocop-performance</code> and <code>rubocop-minitest</code>.</p>

<p>Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!</p>

<p>Some closing notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned above, recently we’ve extracted RuboCop’s AST-related logic to the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast">rubocop-ast</a> gem, that’s going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">parser</a>’s API. I’d love to see more tools using it, as I think we really managed to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune. By the way, he released <code>rubocop-ast</code> 1.0 today! We have some cause for double celebration!</li>
  <li>The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html">upgrade notes</a> if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.</li>
  <li>We’ve made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> for all the details.</li>
  <li><code>rubocop-rspec</code> is currently not compatible with RuboCop 1.0, but we’re working on this. You can follow the progress on that front <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/issues/1051">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<p>I feel a bit sorry for disappointing everyone who hoped we’d make it
to RuboCop 0.99, before cutting RuboCop 1.0. We did our best and we
had a great 0.x run, but we ran out of things to do.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> :-) On the bright side - now
I can finally say that I’ve got 99 problems (and 200 open issues), but cutting RuboCop 1.0 ain’t one.</p>

<p>Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we’ll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Koichi recently covered in great details our long journey to RuboCop 1.0 in his presentation <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/koic/road-to-rubocop-1-dot-0">Road to RuboCop 1.0</a> at RubyKaigi 2020. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those of you who’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of RuboCop 1.0 and all the challenges we had to solve along the way!</p>

<p>Ilograph is written in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> because of the productivity and safety benefits it provides over standard Javascript. Over time, however, it has proven valuable in an unexpected, and big, way. Typescript has gone beyond being just the language Ilograph is written in; here are four ways it has actually influenced Ilograph’s very design.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework">REWORK</a>, the founders of 37Signals (now called Basecamp) describe products that are “at-home good”. Such products, they say, are not merely easy to pick up and use; they go beyond “quick wins” and provide the kind of long-term benefits sought out by professionals.</p>

<p>Typescript is at-home good. As a superset of Javascript, it is, by definition, harder to learn than Javascript. There is also an up-front configuration cost, and annotating types in code requires keystrokes that Javascript does not. However, once developers get it “home” and really begin using it, the <a href="https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/getting-started/why-typescript">long-term payoffs</a> are enormous. Professional developers seek out these kinds of trade-offs. They do not (or at least should not) want “easy”, because “easy” doesn’t scale.</p>

<p>Using this as inspiration, Ilograph’s primary goal is to be “at-home good”. It is geared towards pros and designed to scale. For example, it does not use drag-and-drop; instead, users define <a href="https://www.ilograph.com/docs/editing/idl/">diagrams using code</a>. Drag-and-drop is easy to learn, but it doesn’t scale as well as code (rearranging boxes and fiddling with arrows and font sizes gradually becomes a nightmare).</p>

<p>Other features, like multi-perspective diagrams and resource inheritance allow advanced users to express things that simpler drag-and-drop tools do not. This is one of Ilograph’s “big bets”; it caters to a smaller pool of advanced users, but it is better tailored to their needs.</p>

<h5 id="influence-2-starting-with-a-model">Influence #2: Starting with a Model</h5>

<p>The eponymous feature of Typescript is that it allows developers to declare their data types in code. Using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html">interfaces</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html">types</a>, developers define what their data types look like, typically before writing the functional code that uses those types. The data types and functional code then usually evolve together over the course of development. Javascript, by contrast, does not support this and data types are implicit (or, at best, checked only at runtime).</p>

<p>Together, all of the explicitly-declared types in a Typescript program form a <strong>model</strong>. This model is the foundation of the codebase; the functional code depends on this model, but not vice-versa.</p>

    <img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/iloTs/diagram.png" alt="Ilograph diagrams aren&amp;rsquo;t type-checked per se, but they are checked against a shared model"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Ilograph diagrams aren’t type-checked per se, but they are checked against a shared model</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Using this as inspiration, Ilograph diagrams also start with a <a href="https://www.ilograph.com/docs/editing/resources/">model</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Users declare what resources <strong>are</strong> before declaring how they are related (in <a href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.Ilograph/Request">Relational perspectives</a>) and their behaviors (in <a href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.Ilograph/Get%2520Diagram">Sequence perspectives</a>). Like in Typescript, users give resources both a name and a type (in the form of a subtitle and/or icon) since both are important. This explicitness not only improves developer and viewer understanding, but also improves developer tooling.</p>

<h5 id="influence-3-the-developer-experience">Influence #3: The Developer Experience</h5>

<p>Typescript may be harder to <em>learn</em> than Javascript (see above), but its design enables tooling that makes it easier to work with. The most prominent example is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript">autocomplete</a>, which offers more precise suggestions and catches more errors when using Typescript compared to Javascript. This instant feedback gives the developer “micro wins” and helps keep them in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/iloTs/autocomplete.png" alt="Autocomplete"></p>

<p>For the same reasons, Ilograph has an integrated editor with auto-complete that leverages the diagram model. More critically, Ilograph diagrams are laid out automatically, freeing the designer from having to manually place elements, arrows and so on.</p>

<p>In all of these cases, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load</a> on the developer/designer is reduced. Whether programming or diagramming, the more the computer helps with the small things (syntax errors, diagram layout), the more the user can focus on the high-level goals they are trying to achieve.</p>

<h5 id="influence-4-built-to-change-and-built-to-last-a-paradox">Influence #4: Built-To-Change <em>and</em> Built-To-Last, a Paradox</h5>

<p>Ilograph currently has about 15,000 lines of Typescript code. I’d estimate that at least that many lines of code have been deleted or rewritten over its lifespan (4 years). Almost everything about the original app, including its appearance, editing experience, and even nomenclature are drastically different today.</p>

<p>That may sound like waste, but it’s actually a sign of a healthy app that is adapting to feedback and shifting priorities. The world changes, after all, and we must change along with it.</p>

<p>I can say with 100% confidence that Ilograph would not exist without Typescript; it has made making so many changes possible. Without these changes, Ilograph would have been abandoned long ago. That is the paradox: things that are built-to-change last. Things that aren’t die out.</p>

<p>This might be the biggest influence Typescript has had on Ilograph. Like Typescript applications, Ilograph diagrams are easy to change. Making diagrams easy to change means that they are more likely to be kept up-to-date and relevant, and are more likely to provide long-term value.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to reverse a video using FFmpeg because FFmpeg has a built-in <code>reverse</code> filter that can do this job for both audio and video! Let’s learn how in this tutorial and some gotcha’s that you should avoid. </p>



<h2>Reverse a Video using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Here it is! A simple one-liner that takes your video and reverses it. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p>And if you want to reverse the audio and video, all you gotta do is use this command.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe <code><code><code>-i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse -af areverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></code></code></pre>



<p>It’s as simple as that. </p>



<p>I used it on the Parkjoy sequence downloaded from <a aria-label="xiph (opens in a new tab)" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xiph</a>. Note, that the original video is in <code>y4m</code> format and I first transcoded it to H.264/AVC using <code>crf=1</code> and then added timestamps for this fun experiment. </p>



<p>If you want to learn how to add timestamps to your video using the <code>drawtext</code> filter, then <a href="https://ottverse.com/ffmpeg-drawtext-filter-dynamic-overlays-timecode-scrolling-text-credits/">read this tutorial on OTTVerse.com</a>. </p>



<p>Here is the original sequence </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236838" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<p>And here is the reversed sequence – fun right? </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236943" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<h2>Caution for Large Files</h2>



<p>The problem with the <code>reverse</code> filter is that it loads the sequence into memory and if you try this on large sequences, you could very easily run out of memory. </p>



<p>The solution for this is to split your video into small pieces or segments, reverse each of them, and join them in the reverse order (yea, remember that!). </p>



<p>If you don’t know how to cut a video into small pieces, check out our <a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="tutorial on trimming or cutting videos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial on trimming or cutting videos</a>. </p>

                    <p>A while ago when I got some Raspberry Pi's, I had a ton of issues with power. I bought a YZXStudio USB power meter/analyzer and a USB load tester, and tested every charger and cable I owned. I found a TON of bad cables which I threw out</p><p>Most of the pictures here are actually from 2017, but I never made any posts about them. So if you see I have no USB-C, thats why</p><p>This isn't much of a review, but just a post to show you what you can do</p><p>Here I'm testing an Anker charger, this thing is great and never drops below 5v at all. You can see the load tester plugged into the analyzer</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here is an example of a good USB cable, also an Anker cable.

The answer is pretty obvious. Open Source rules the world and is a thriving example of how communities can collaborate to build incredible quality products in the open. Such values as transparency, quality, security, and collaboration have been Mudita’s core values from day one. There’s simply no other way for us to release software as to be transparent and open about it. There are many Open Source enthusiasts at Mudita and without Open Source community, we would never be able to make the company happen in the first place.</p><p>Our community has only reassured us that they value the principles of open software - here’s just a few of the quotes from the <a href="https://forum.mudita.com/t/open-source-muditaos/648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MuditaOS - Open Source topic on our forum</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Not going full FOSS (copyleft licenses) with all the community-based advantages (R&amp;D, promotion, bug fixing, trust on privacy, possible leading OS, etc.) would definitely be a huge and sad mistake for this well-thought project. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Another great aspect would be allowing people to exchange code with Mudita on tools like GitHub. Open source community could even help you in making the product better and better, meet more individual needs, help in debugging, and the most important, allow us to stay free. - darkponay</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>As far as I am concerned, Mudita is not here to build up yet another technological jail; it’s about providing by default a benevolent, useful and non-attention-seeking framework - a caring philosophy, not another mind’s prison. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>There are also those who believe that non-free software is inherently unethical and I think that’s a respectable point of view, especially when it comes to a device as necessary for daily life as a cellphone. - Matt_McArthur</em></p></blockquote><p>In terms of licensing, we decided to go for <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0)</a>. This is a strong copyleft license which obliges anyone who introduces changes to the code or uses the code for their own purposes in any form to make the complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, to be available in the open under the same license.</p><h3>Join the MuditaOS Developer Preview</h3><p>The MuditaOS code will be publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/mudita/MuditaOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> on the day we officially launch Mudita Pure and start shipping our phones to backers and customers. Before we go all out, we would like to invite our community for a Developer Preview of the code and documentation.</p><p>While you’re reading this blog post, we’re preparing the necessary infrastructure, guidelines, and spaces for the MuditaOS community to grow. We would love all Mudita community Open Source enthusiasts to <a href="https://choosemindfully.typeform.com/to/dx9opXx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for the Developer Preview.</a> The number of places is limited - so register while you can. After you apply with your email you’ll receive a message explaining the next step.</p><p>During the Developer Preview, we’ll be asking you for feedback regarding our Open Source infrastructure, documentation, guides, etc. so that we can act on and be well prepared for the “Go live with Open Source” day.</p><p>What’s worth mentioning is that <strong>we'll award 10 of the most active Open Source contributors with a free Mudita Pure phone</strong> as soon as we'll be able to ship them. We reserve the freedom to subjectively decide which 10 community members were the most valuable contributors during the Developer Preview period. Contributions include documentation changes, bug fixes, and helping our team on creating and delivering features.

We want our whole community to celebrate the fact that we are going Open Source. This is why <strong>we have added an </strong><code><strong>opensource</strong></code><strong> -5% discount code</strong> available to use until the end of October inside our online store, on top of the existing discounts.</p><p>We hope that you’re as excited as we are about starting this Open Source journey! We look forward to working with you on the best possible operating system for Mudita Pure.</p><div><section><h3>Comments <span>(<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></h3><span>No comments here.

<blockquote><p><strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) offers a philosophy for operating reliable distributed systems, with admirable principles and practices. However, in only a few years SRE cargo culting has emerged at a level to rival DevOps cargo culting in the 2010s.&nbsp;<p>What is SRE as a Cult, and how does it intersect with DevOps as a Cult? Why is SRE so difficult to apply to enterprise organisations with IT as a A Cost Centre? Why is an emphasis on operability more important to IT performance than SRE?</p></strong></p></blockquote>



<h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A successful Digital transformation is predicated on a transition from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-cost-centre/">IT as a Cost Centre</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-business-differentiator/">IT as a Business Differentiator</a>. An IT cost centre creates segregated Delivery and Operations teams, trapped in an endless conflict between speed and reliability. Delivery wants to maximise deployments, to increase speed. Operations wants to minimise deployments, to increase reliability. This results in low performance IT, and has negative consequences for profitability, market share, and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9F83WM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Accelerate</em></a>, Dr Nicole Forsgren <em>et al</em> demonstrates speed and reliability are not a zero sum game. Investing in both Continuous Delivery and Operability will produce a high performance IT capability that can uncover new product revenue streams. For instance, transforming production support from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-ops-runs-it/">You Build It Ops Run It</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-you-run-it/">You Build It You Run It</a> will unlock daily deployments, and have a positive impact on service reliability. User satisfaction, revenue protection, and brand reputation will all be improved.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Philosophy</h3>



<p>In 2004, Ben Treynor Sloss started an initiative called SRE within Google. He later described SRE as a software engineering approach to IT operations, with developers automating work historically owned outside Google by sysadmins. SRE key concepts include:</p>



<ul><li>Availability levels.</li><li>Service Level Objectives.</li><li>Error budgets.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-sre-run-it">You Build It SRE Run It</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Availability levels are known by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability" target="_blank">nines of availability</a>. 99.0% is two nines, 99.999% is five nines. 100% availability is unachievable, as less reliable user devices will limit the user experience. 100% is also undesirable, as maximising availability limits speed of feature delivery and increases operational costs. In the seminal book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/" target="_blank"><em>Site Reliability Engineering</em></a>, Betsey Byers <em>et al</em> observe that ‘an additional nine of reliability requires an order of magnitude more engineering effort’. At any availability level, an amount of unplanned downtime needs to be tolerated, in order to invest in feature delivery.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a published target range of measurements, which sets user expectations on an aspect of service performance. A product manager chooses SLOs, based on their own risk tolerance. They have to balance the engineering cost of meeting an SLO with user needs, the revenue potential of the service, and competitor offerings. An availability SLO could be a median request success rate of 99.9% in 24 hours, with measurements collected every minute for 24 hours as a Service Level Indicator (SLI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>An error budget is a quarterly amount of tolerable, unplanned downtime for a service. It is used to mitigate any inter-team conflicts between product teams and SRE teams, as found in You Build It Ops Run It. It is calculated as 100% minus the chosen nines of availability. For example, an availability level of 99.9% equates to an error budget of 0.01% unsuccessful requests. 0.002% of failing requests in a week would consume 20% of the error budget, and leave 80% for the quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It is a conditional production support method, where a team of SREs support a service for a product team. All product teams do You Build It You Run It by default, and there are strict entry and exit criteria for an SRE team. A service must have a critical level of user traffic, some elevated SLOs, and pass a readiness review. The SREs will take over on-call, and ensure SLOs are consistently met. The product team can launch new features if the service is within its error budget. If not, they cannot deploy until any errors are resolved. If the error budget is repeatedly blown, the SRE team can hand on-call back to the product team, who revert to You Build It You Run It.</p>



<p>This is <strong>SRE as a Philosophy</strong>. The biggest gift from SRE is a framework for quantifying availability targets and engineering effort, based on product revenue. SRE has also promoted ideas such as measuring partial availability, monitoring the golden signals of a service, building SLO alerts and SLI dashboards from the same telemetry data, and reducing operational toil where possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>In the 2010s, the DevOps philosophy of collaboration was bastardised by <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/aim-for-operability-not-devops-as-a-cult/">DevOps as a Cult</a>. The DevOps cargo cult is ubiquitous, and wrong. Its beliefs are:</p>



<ol><li>The divide between Delivery and Operations teams is <em>always</em> the constraint in IT performance.&nbsp;</li><li>DevOps automation tools, DevOps engineers, DevOps teams, and/or DevOps certifications are <em>always</em> solutions to that problem.</li></ol>



<p>In a similar vein, the SRE philosophy has been corrupted by <strong>SRE as a Cult</strong>. The SRE cargo cult is based on the same flawed premise, and espouses SRE error budgets, SRE engineers, SRE teams, and SRE certifications as a panacea. Examples include Patrick Hill stating in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/devops/sre" target="_blank">Love DevOps? Wait until you meet SRE</a> that ‘SRE removes the conjecture and debate over what can be launched and when’, and the DevOps Institute offering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://devopsinstitute.com/certifications/sre-foundation/" target="_blank">SRE certification</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SRE as a Cult ignores the central question facing the SRE philosophy – its applicability to IT as a Cost Centre. SRE originated from talented, opinionated software engineers in a single, unique organisation. Google has IT as a Business Differentiator as a core tenet. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22" target="_blank"><em>A Typology of Organisational Cultures</em></a> by Ron Westrum, its organisational culture can be described as generative. <em>Accelerate</em> found a generative culture is predictive of high performance IT, and less employee burnout.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>There are fundamental challenges with applying SRE to an IT as a Cost Centre organisation with a bureaucratic or pathological culture. Product, Delivery, and Operations teams will be hindered by orthogonal incentives, funding pressures, and silo rivalries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Availability levels are a leading indicator of cross-organisation support for SRE. When failure leads to scapegoating or justice:</p>



<ul><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not agree 100% reliability is unachievable.</li><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not accept an additional nine of reliability means an order of magnitude more engineering effort.&nbsp;</li><li>Heads of Delivery/Operations might not consent to availability levels being owned by product managers.</li></ul>



<p>Service Level Objectives are based on the risk tolerances of product managers. When responsibilities are shirked or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>Product managers might decline to take on responsibility for service availability.</li><li>Product managers will need help from Delivery teams to uncover user expectations, calculate service revenue potential, and check competitor availability levels.</li><li>Sysadmins might object to developers wiring automated, fine-grained measurements into their own production alerts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Error budgets depend on shared agreements between different teams, without resorting to the inter-team battles of You Build It Ops Run It. When cooperation is modest or low:</p>



<ul><li>Product manager/developers/sysadmins might disagree on availability levels and the maths behind &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; error budgets.</li><li>Heads of Product/Development might not accept a block on deployments when an error budget is 0%.</li><li>A Head of Operations might not accept deployments at all hours when an error budget is above 0%.</li><li>Product managers/developers might accuse sysadmins of blocking deployments unnecessarily</li><li>Sysadmins might accuse product managers/developers of jeopardising reliability</li><li>A Head of Operations might arbitrarily block production deployments</li><li>A Head of Development might escalate a block on production deployments</li><li>A Head of Product might override a block on production deployments</li></ul>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It means a central developer team supporting services with high availability levels and critical user traffic, while other developer teams support their own services under You Build It You Run It. It is worlds apart from You Build It Ops Run It. When bridging is merely tolerated or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>A Head of Operations might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their opex budget</li><li>A Head of Development might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their capex budget</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to afford months of software engineering training for their sysadmins on an opex budget</li><li>Sysadmins might not want to undergo training, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Developers might not want to do on-call for their services, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Delivery teams will find it hard to collaborate with an Operations SRE team on errors and incident management</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to transfer an unreliable service back to the original Delivery team, if it was disbanded when its capex funding ended&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In <em>Site Reliability Engineering</em>, Ben Treynor Sloss identifies SRE recruitment as a significant challenge for Google. Developers are needed that excel in both software engineering and systems administration, which is rare. He counters this with the argument that an SRE team is cheaper than an Operations team, as the headcount is reduced by task automation. Recruitment challenges will be exacerbated in IT as a Cost Centre organisations, due to much smaller recruitment budgets. The touted headcount benefit is absurd, as salary rates are invariably higher for developers than sysadmins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aim for Operability, not SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>Continuous Delivery requires operational excellence. Reliable production services will minimise operational rework, and increase the throughput of feature delivery. There are many pathways to Operability, and SRE is only one of those pathways. SRE as a Cult will promote the world …</p></div></div>

<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>

<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

<p>This output is saying that a floating point multiplication operation is performed and the answer is returned. We can even look at the assembly</p>

<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>What happens when we don't have type stability? Let's inspect this code:</p>

<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

<p>

Tagged in: <a href="https://try.popho.be/tag_vpn.html">vpn</a></p><p>I’ve had enough of paying for 1Gbps fiber connection and only using 100Mbps because of using my server at <a href="https://kimsufi.com/">Kimsufi</a> as my main gate to the internet.</p>
<p>The goal is now to use my VPN connection to protect my websurf only (no webmaster needs to get my home IP). The rest is more or less not-as-private, and will be using my ISP’s (high bandwidth) connection (games, GPG-signed updates). This usage differs from <a href="https://wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution">other examples that make seldom use of the <em>physical realm</em></a>: here we will use the physical connection by default, and “containing” specific applications.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://try.popho.be/images/vpn-netns-objective.svg" alt="Our objective, see the digraph’s source at sourcehut">
</figure>
<p>You should probably be up to speed with <a href="https://wireguard.com/">what WireGuard is</a> and how it works: see e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://try.popho.be/wg.html">a previous entry</a>.</p>

<p>Create an empty <code>netns</code> and populate it with <code>lo</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ip netns add vpn
ip -n vpn link set lo up</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wg1</code> interface’s “place of birth” is the physical realm. Thus, we first need to create <code>wg1</code> in the unnamed namespace before moving it to the <code>vpn</code> netspace. This is needed because <code>wg1</code> will send (encrypted) packets to the server through a real interface. If we create <code>wg1</code> in the <code>vpn</code> namespace, WireGuard won’t know how to reach the outside world (including the WireGuard server).</p>
<pre><code>ip link add wg1 type wireguard
ip link set wg1 netns vpn</code></pre>
<p>Then we use <code>wg(8)</code> and <code>ip(8)</code> to setup our VPN link</p>
<pre><code>ip netns exec vpn wg setconf wg1 /etc/wireguard/wg1.conf
ip -n vpn a add 10.X.Y.PPP/24 dev wg1
ip -n vpn a add aaaa::ffff/64 dev wg1
ip -n vpn link set wg1 up
ip -n vpn route add default dev wg1
ip -n vpn -6 route add default dev wg1</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget to put a <code>resolv.conf(5)</code> file in <code>/etc/netns/vpn</code> as written in <code>ip-netns(8)</code>’ manpage. Now, testing time:</p>
<pre><code>for v in 4 6; do
 printf '%s' "default IPv$v: " ; curl -s$v https://icanhazip.com
 printf '%s' "VPN IPv$v:     " ; ip netns exec vpn curl -s$v https://icanhazip.com
done</code></pre>
<p>It is not yet possible to use <code>systemd.networkd(5)</code> to set everything up correctly, though there seems to be <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/14915">ongoing work on that front</a>; let’s hope it gets a bit more attention than <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/13673">my own bug report to systemd</a>.</p>

<pre><code>% ip netns exec vpn ping -c1 try.popho.be
setting the network namespace "vpn" failed: Operation not permitted</code></pre>
<p><code>ip netns</code> can’t run as user. I can’t be bothered to install and configure <code>sudo</code> properly, so we’ll rely on yet another piece of software instead: <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/"><code>firejail(1)</code></a></p>
<pre><code>% firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn firefox</code></pre>
<p><code>firejail</code> does its job, but this is a pain to type each time. Instead, we’ll wrap firefox in a short script.</p>
<p>We put <code>run-with-vpn</code> in one of the first items of <code>$PATH</code> (in <code>~/bin</code> for example):</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# Aptly linking this script allows us to run any program in a network namespace
# Removing the first item of PATH revokes the precedence of our script, and we
# SHOULD end up using firejail on the REAL binary we target.
# We suppose that firejail does NOT reside next to our script, but further away
# in $PATH

if [ -e /var/run/netns/vpn ] ; then # Network NameSpace exists
  if command -v firejail &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ; then
    PATH=${PATH#*:} firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn "$(basename $0)" "$@" &amp;
  fi
else
  notify-send "NO VPN" "$(basename $0) is running with NO VPN"
  PATH=${PATH#*:} "$(basename $0)" "$@" &amp;
fi</code></pre>
<p>Now, we create a symlink <code>firefox</code> to <code>run-with-vpn</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% cd ~/bin
% ln -s run-with-vpn firefox
% command -v firefox
/home/moviuro/bin/firefox
% sh -x "$(!!)"
+ '[' -e /var/run/netns/vpn ']'
+ command -v firejail
++ basename /home/moviuro/Documents/setup/bin/firefox
+ PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/home/moviuro/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl
+ firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn firefox</code></pre>
<p>With this, we can simply launch <code>firefox</code> from our shell or <code>rofi</code>, and it’ll be run in our VPN NetNS.</p>

<p>The software that runs in a seperate NetNS can’t possibly leak your other addresses (so, that’s cool if you use any modern browser shipping <em>far too many</em> “features” such as: WebRTC…).</p>
<p>My desktop now has one IP that will only do websurf: TCP/80 and 443, UDP 443 and 53; I can filter even more what is allowed outbound in <code>pf</code>.</p>
<p>My machine is no longer blocked by my server’s <code>pf</code> if it tries to initiate connection to known-bad IP addresses (C&amp;C, SpamHaus’ <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/">DROP list</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>I achieved what I set out to do, however I’m a bit dissatisfied about having two VPN interfaces (<code>wg0</code> and <code>wg1</code>) connecting to the same VPN on the same machine, and the tooling is far from perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wg0</code> is just a usual WireGuard interface, <em>without</em> <code>AllowedIPs=0.0.0.0/0</code>; this one allows me to reach some services such as my IRC bouncer or, as shown below, my <a href="https://try.popho.be/byeads.html">lying DNS server</a>;</li>
<li><code>wg1</code> is a WireGuard interface that we have to create by hand, half configure with <code>wg(8)</code>, half with <code>ip(8)</code>;</li>
<li><code>systemd</code> in its race to assimilate everything under the sun, still doesn’t support some features that I needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>On November 20, 2019, at FINOS' flagship conference, the <a href="https://opensourcestrategyforum.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Strategy Forum</a>, FINOS Platinum member <a href="https://developer.gs.com/docs/products/" rel="nofollow">Goldman Sachs</a> announced <a href="https://www.finos.org/press/goldman-announces-pure-alloy-contribution" rel="nofollow">its intention</a> to open source two closely related products into FINOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its internally developed logical modeling language, referred to within the bank as "PURE", and</li>
<li>A workbench of tools, including a visual modeling platform, collectively referred to as "Alloy", created and used within Goldman Sachs to build, design, and execute PURE models</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">PURE language</a>, together with four modules - <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">Studio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">SDLC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">Engine</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">Shared</a> - were open sourced into FINOS on October 19, 2020. Concurrent to their open sourcing, they were collectively given a new, unified name - "Legend". The choice of the Legend name reflects how for Goldman Sachs the language and platform have been a guide - a legend - for the bank's data strategy.</p>

<p>A shared, external instance of Legend deployed on AWS within FINOS' infrastructure is available at <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">https://legend.finos.org/studio</a>. The primary purpose of this instance is to provide a shared modeling environment for the FINOS community and its projects. An additional purpose of this instance is to provide a place where people can try out Legend for themselves, check out its tools and features, and see what a Legend model looks like. This instance of Legend was the same instance that was used by the pilot group to model in Phase 1 (see <a href="#Roadmap">Roadmap</a> section below for more info on our phases).</p>

You will need a GitHub account and, if want to be able to create and edit models, be covered by a <a href="https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements#ContributionComplianceRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement" rel="nofollow">Contributor License Agreement</a> with FINOS (otherwise a read-only account will be created).</p>
<p>Note that the features available in the shared, external Legend instance within FINOS infrastructure largely map to the five modules open sourced to date. Features that are not yet available include model-to-database mappings and the execution of queries as services. As more modules are open sourced, more features will be activated in the shared instance.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/finos/alloy/issues/143">Coming Soon</a>; Information on running and installing your own instance of Legend, locallly, on premise, or in a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, OpenShift, Google, etc.)</p>

<h2>GitHub and GitLab</h2>
<p>The Legend platform and project makes use of both GitHub and GitLab.</p>
<h3>GitHub</h3>
<ul>
<li>GitHub, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/finos/">FINOS GitHub organization</a>, is the distributed source and version control management system used for Legend code.
<ul>
<li>The Legend GitHub repos, like all FINOS repos, are configured to make use of the FINOS <a href="https://odp.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Developer Platform</a> tooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GitHub infrastructure is what's used to do Legend builds (e.g., of <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.finos.legend" rel="nofollow">Legend JARS, which are then distributed through Maven Central</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>GitLab</h3>
<ul>
<li>GitLab is used for source control of models "under the hood" within the Legend SDLC module. As such the models, written in the Legend language, are stored in GitLab repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repositores</h2>
<h3>Code Repositories (GitHub)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/finos/legend">This repository (finos/legend)</a> is the parent repository for the project. It is used principally for overall Legend documentation and issue tracking. The code itself for the 5 modules open sourced thusfar can be found in the following 5 child repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">Shared Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">https://github.com/finos/legend-shared</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">SDLC Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">Studio Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">https://github.com/finos/legend-studio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">Engine Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">https://github.com/finos/legend-engine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">Legend Language</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">https://github.com/finos/legend-pure</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Module Specific Issues</h4>
<p>Module specific issues are opened, maintained, and prioritized within the modules specific issue list (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues">https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues</a> for Legend Studio). Issues can be aggregated from multiple reposistories as needed through <a href="https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects">FINOS organization level GitHub kanban boards("Projects")</a>.</p>
<h3>Model Repositories (GitLab)</h3>
<p>Legend models developed on <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">the external shared instance</a>, including those built during the Phase 1 pilot described below, are themselves open sourced code and available in the following GitLab repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>FX Options extensions to the CDM: <a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/cdm" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/cdm</a></li>
<li>Commodities Reference Data: <a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/commonrefdata" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/commonrefdata</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note on model access in GitLab</strong> Currently to access (and fork, etc.) these GitLab model repositories directly, you will need an account on the Legend shared instance (an account is also required to model and access these models through the Studio UI). An account may be requested through the account request form at the bottom of <a href="https://www.finos.org/legend" rel="nofollow">https://www.finos.org/legend</a>. In the future we plan to <a href="https://github.com/finos/alloy/issues/177">migrate these model repositories</a> to public repos on GitLab.com, after which an account will no longer be needed to access and contain the repositories that contain the models.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to get involved with Legend and contribute to it, see the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file or the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/docs/getting-started/contribute-to-legend" rel="nofollow">Contribute section of the docs site</a>.</p>

<p>(Coming Soon)</p>

<h2>Phase 0 (October 2019 - January 2020) - COMPLETED</h2>
<ul>
<li>Announced the intention to open source PURE/Alloy (now named Legend) at the <a href="https://opensourcestrategyforum.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Strategy Forum</a></li>
<li>Deployed an <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/legend.finos.org/studio">external instance of Legend</a> to AWS within FINOS infrastructure, initially for use in Phase 1 (see below) for pilot participants to use to do shared modeling.</li>
<li>Commenced internal code evaluation and preparation for open sourcing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 1 (January 2020 - September 2020) - COMPLETED</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opened the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/legend.finos.org/studio">external instance of Legend</a> Studio deployed in Phase 0 to a pilot group of financial institutions, composed of FINOS members plus several other institutions that expressed an interest in participating in the pilot, for them together with Goldman Sachs and FINOS to evaluate the use of Legend to do shared, collaborative modeling. In this release, Studio supported a limited set of functionality, including the creation of data models, model-to-model mappings, constraints and derivations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the pilot phase, modelers collaborated on the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">Legend external instance</a> to build shared models. Modeling occurred in two work streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/meeting-minutes/fx-options-wg">An FX workstream of the the pilot group</a> extended and expanded the FX Option model of the Common Domain Model (CDM), developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The Averaging Model developed during the pilot has since been approved by the ISDA Architecture Review Committee and <a href="https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/releases/all.html" rel="nofollow">released in the CDM (see 2.82.8)</a>.</li>
<li>The pilot group also created a <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/meeting-minutes/commodities-ref-data-wg">Commodity Reference Data workstream</a>, to work on commodities data, especially in the context of a Fixed vs Float swap, including defining a payout model to be proposed into the CDM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other areas that the pilot group have discussed as potential areas to model together in Legend include Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data as well as potentially continuing some of the work started by the <a href="https://fo.finos.org/docs/objects/rfq" rel="nofollow">FINOS Financial Objects program on RFQ</a> in the context of interest rate swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performed code readiness work to extract Legend code from GS infrastructure, and sufficiently abstract and generalize code base as needed. Revised code base to reflect new name (note that some references to old "PURE" and "Alloy" name still exist). GS Engineering, together with FINOS and Linux Foundation DevOps teams, performed code scanning and remediations. Moved Goldman Sachs's daily production builds of Legend to FINOS infrastructure and public GitHub repos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 2 (October 2020 - December 2020)</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 2020.10.19 made underlying code bases to five Legend modules available as open source under an Apache 2.0 license</li>
<li>Announced new name (Legend) and rebranded</li>
<li>Identify "good first issues" for developers new to Legend</li>
<li>Begin accepting pull requests of code from external (non-GS) developers.</li>
<li>Conduct office hours for external developers interested in getting involved with Legend</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 3 (Q1 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make additional functionality available in Studio, including relational execution, support for flat data sources (e.g., csv) and automated code generation (e.g., JSON schema, Protobuf, AVRO).</li>
<li>Transition shared model repositories from hosted GitLab instance (gitlab.legend.finos.org) to gitlab.com.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 4 (Q3 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Cube UI for user-friendly tabular data exploration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 5 (Q4 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Query UI to search and access modeled data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 6 (Q4 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Services UI. This will allow managing of production data services (APIs) for repeatable and controlled data access.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Legend Documentation Site (legend.finos.org)</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">documentation site</a> is built using Docusaurus based on the markdown files in the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/docs"><code>docs</code></a> folder.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend">This Repository - GitHub.com (github.com/finos/legend)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/github.com/finos/legend">This repository (github.com/finos/legend)</a> hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underling files for the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Legend Documentation site</a> (composed in markdown file format and stored in the <code>docs/</code> folder)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/issues">shared issues list</a> used for task management to track project activity around documentation, deployments, and the overall effort associated with open sourcing Legend</li>
<li>These issues are organized in various kanban boards, including the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/5">overall project kanban</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">FINOS Hosted GitLab Repository (gitlab.legend.finos.org)</a></h2>
<p>A separate <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/gitlab.legend.finos.org">hosted Gitlab repository, gitlab.legend.finos.org</a> hosts shared models that were developed by the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/forum/#!forum/legend-pilot" rel="nofollow">Legend project pilot team</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation" rel="nofollow">gitlab.com (https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation)</a> [Not Yet Used]</h2>
<p>In the future we intend to migrate the models repositories from the hosted GitLab repository to <a href="https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation</a>. For now, this is unused but will eventually be the long-term home for public models built using Legend.</p>

This type of content is followed by demo/product tour pages and by pricing pages.</p><p>The next ones are the how-to posts and feature landing pages, which are targetting specific pain points. However, the industry articles — despite the good click-through rates, aren’t generating conversions yet.</p><p>How about the informational content types — guides, what is, strategy/thought leadership, best practices articles?</p><p>These aren’t performing well, so for this particular startup, it makes no sense to invest time into creating more top-of-the-funnel content, unless their only focus is getting more page views.</p><p>The top-of-the-funnel, informational content is, indeed, generating more views than the other types:</p><p><img alt="Sessions &amp; pages session per funnel" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/wqg266fbc5en/7i2dCLqPkOVO2YlooK9Cnl/45625e480ddc5194e13b085a067d5955/Sessions___pages_session_per_funnel.png"><img alt="Pages session and conversion rates per funnel" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/wqg266fbc5en/5zH4LJ3OWuUO8TnbK8UYAl/490622fc6c1cfba44ede5b73c0424b62/Pages_session_and_conversion_rates_per_funnel.png"></p><p>What’s interesting to see is that middle-of-the-funnel content, which is the best performing for this client, gets the most pages/session (average numbers in the graphics), as well as the best conversion rate.</p><p>So if this startup wants to increase their chances of converting more users, they could focus more on MOFU content.</p><p>Also, as a growth hacking experiment, they could optimize the bottom-of-the-funnel content to encourage users to visit more pages/session and see if this helps drive conversions up as well.</p><p>Of course, these numbers will vary depending on the amount of content produced, the niche, the type of SaaS, and whether it’s a B2B or B2C product.</p><p>Still, you can take these insights into consideration when planning your content calendar and deciding the types of content to invest more time in.</p><blockquote><p>If you own an early-stage SaaS startup and need some <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/content-strategy/">guidance with your content strategy</a>, or you'd like to benefit from a similar <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/content-audit/">content audit</a>, <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/contact/">get in touch with our team</a>!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Social media are now one of the <strong>most used tools for customer service</strong>, but how can you use them professionally and effectively for your brand?</p>



<p>At first, there was the phone. It was the only way people could contact customer care to report a problem or ask for a piece of information.</p>



<p>Then, the Internet came, and emails became the most famous tool. Years later, social media sprang, and <strong>customer service started to act on social platforms</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you already use them for your customer service?</p>



<p>If yes, we hope those tips and tricks will help you make it even better.</p>



<p>If not, keep reading to become the king of social media customer service!</p>




<h2>
<span id="What_is_social_media_customer_service,_and_why_you_need_one"></span>What is social media customer service, and why you need one?<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Social media customer service <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means</a> “using social channels to provide efficient and effective customer service and support. Customers expect to be able to reach out to brands on social channels for help—and get a quick reply.”</p>



<p>It sounds simple – all you need is a computer, your customers’ comments, and someone that answers them.</p>



<p>Social media customer service keywords should be <strong>“efficient support” and “quick reply”.</strong> They also are the most important and challenging elements to reach.</p>



<p>Reality is a bit more complicated than that. You have the chance to build a stable relationship with customers and provide them with real value.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7KBLRL8oQEVX_QldOYPtMT9PFsPJxJyYsaq0TAbHyVvMdarVk8g2ANSa24ZbQ3esYcJ2kFf8jR5RiBZY2ItkVmsclIrxW51pDj9_yCpzwbmI4FJhCyFt6XCwPMWSQrJIV3Emqp0c" width="602" height="452"></p>



<p>As you may be confused by the difference between <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/06/12/a-better-buyer-persona-how-ai-can-improve-your-marketing-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persona and person</a>, you may also ask: is there any difference between social customer service and customer care? The question is legit because often the two terms are confused.</p>



<p>They are pretty close, but they are more cousins than brothers. The main difference between them is proactivity.</p>



<p>Usually, customer service tends to be a <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-customer-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passive strategy</a>, while customer care – especially social media – is a proactive one.</p>



<p>Customer service enters the scene when people ask for it, usually after meeting the brand and purchasing their products.</p>



<p>The response is precise and quick, but customers have to ask it when they need it.</p>



<p>On the other hand, customer care is <strong>way more active on a daily basis to meet customers’ needs.</strong> For example, having self-service helps corners offer a personalized experience, and it even starts before the customer’s purchase.</p>



<p>Let’s discover the three main tips to have outstanding social media customer service.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Be_where_your_customers_are"></span><strong>Be where your customers are</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>First of all, today, people expect to have exceptional customer service, especially on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If it doesn’t happen, they move away.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Where does the interaction have to happen? <strong>Everywhere!</strong> Multi-touch customer services are pretty usual now, including significant social networks.</p>



<p>There is no phone anymore to contact a company – customers can reach their favorite brands on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. As Hootsuite points out, “64% of people would rather message than call a business” and “social media is the preferred customer support channel for those under 25, with 32.3% of them saying it’s their top choice”.</p>



<p>If you already haven’t, you better start looking for a social media manager or community manager!</p>



<h3>
<span id="Develop_listening_customer%E2%80%99s_needs"></span><strong>Develop listening customer’s needs</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>When you decide to implement a social media customer service, the first question you need to ask is on which platforms you want to focus on. Even if you would like to be social on Earth to be sure, it would be impossible and useless.</p>



<p>It would be impossible because you wouldn’t probably have enough time and resources to do it.</p>



<p>It would be useless because your target is unlikely to be on every social media platform existent – you only have to<strong> pick the ones in which your audience is</strong>. Most of the time, you can find your target audience on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>



<p>Once you have chosen your platforms – with the help of <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/target-market-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">target analysis</a>, for example – it is time to<a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/06/22/keep-your-ears-open-how-social-listening-helps-you-to-understand-your-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> start listening</a>.</p>



<p>If you have an online presence already – and if you haven’t, what are you waiting for? -l<strong>isten to what your audience says about you</strong>, managing their voice scattered along with the different places where they are</p>



<p>Once you have collected enough data, you can proceed with <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/10/07/sentiment-analysis-the-success-for-brand-reputation-lies-in-language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment analysis</a>.</p>



<p>Do they discuss your brand? Are the words flattering or not? Is there a flaw or a negative comment that appears more often than the others? Are there technical problems that your brand still hasn’t solved? How many feedbacks did you receive, and of which quality? Are there recurrent questions that you could solve with a FAQ section on your website?</p>



<p>You need to pull out all this data. If you are going to do it manually, you are going to have a hard life.</p>



<p>By using customer journey analytics systems like <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostwriter AI </a>you can do it in the space of minutes.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ocZr3jinFDLWkTt0qHA0walxONTS-Gp3SYA8vCCTxMHaNoxYIXl3gBPz7_uWdVArJ5MsA7Rvzfj79ZsXPMMvgT9uaY0KAWPfICupfHnQ61nnP6zKU8C861d8jmLJt0TfIBhqEszj" width="602" height="299"></p>



<p>All of this will help you <strong>understand where you should focus</strong> your attention and time to make the user experience more exciting and appealing.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Create_a_bond"></span><strong>Create a bond&nbsp;</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>It is easy to understand: the more someone takes care of you, the more you tend to create a bond with them. With customers and customer service, it is the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the chance to <strong>create a bond and a relationship on social media </strong>with your customers based on muted trust.</p>



<p>If a customer has a problem with their favorite brand, a serious one, this already is quite tragic for the brand itself. The risk is to crack the faith the clients have in you.</p>



<p>Things get even worse when the brand is so self-centered that it merely disappears or sends pre-written emails without a spark of personalization or care.</p>



<p>And trust us – <strong>customers can feel it.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, if the brand shows that the customer is essential, if it shows care and attention, if it asks the problem and tries to solve it in the best way possible, you can be sure that people will remember this. If we remember the adverse events, what can be better than solving a problem for our customers and having their loyalty renewed?</p>



<h2>
<span id="Best_practices_for_a_social_media_customer_service_strategy"></span>Best practices for a social media customer service strategy<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s see together <strong>five tips and tricks</strong>, or best practices, for you to make your social media customer service shine like a diamond!</p>



<h3>
<span id="Provide_the_right_service_on_each_channel"></span><strong>Provide the right service on each channel</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Not all social media platforms are the same, and this is true also when brands use them as part of their customer service strategy.</p>



<p>Even if customers use social media in a very sparse way, you need to <strong>know everyone’s rules </strong>before answering to comments and messages.</p>



<p>It does not mean just remembering that Twitter has a defined number of characters you can use. It has more to do on the kind of platform you are using and the different tones of voices you can choose between.</p>



<p>Naturally, the rule you need to remember is that <strong>no social network allows you to lose your professionalism</strong>. Always behave like the professional worker you are, without trying, i.e., to make people laugh.</p>



<p>That said, on Facebook, you can send a link in the comment and create contact with the clients’ needs.</p>



<p>You can use some specific keywords on Twitter to expand your audience and solve more than one person’s problems.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Create_a_set_of_guidelines"></span><strong>Create a set of guidelines</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Even games have rules to follow, so it is natural that a brand that deals with customers has them, too.</p>



<p>They are essential for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, they give you <strong>a trace to follow in every circumstance</strong>: an angry customer, a troll, a specific request, a flame that ignited under a controversial post.</p>



<p>Moreover, it defines the brand and makes it recognizable in every aspect, platform, and moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, one thing you may decide is the tone of voice. In which way am I going to answer the questions of my audience? A classic and professional one, an ironic one, a serious one?</p>



<h3>
<span id="Be_proactive_in_providing_a_better_service"></span><strong>Be proactive in providing a better service.</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Do not only wait for customers to ask you something – <strong>be proactive and anticipate them!</strong></p>



<p>Do they often ask you specific questions? Use it at your advantage!</p>



<p>You can create an FAQ. lists, educational pieces content, freebies to make people know your product better.</p>



<p>Use your customers’ doubts to create useful resources and better service!</p>



<h3>
<span id="Answer_every_single_question_%E2%80%93_and_as_quickly_as_you_can!"></span><strong>Answer every single question – and as quickly as you can!</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>The first rule of customer service is to answer every single question fast and with high accuracy. <strong>Time-response rate counts!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do not forget any questions, even if they are repetitive. They look insignificant because customers will remember it, and other people will see it, for instance, on your public Facebook page.</p>



<p>Always be friendly to the customers and, if you promised to send more information, don’t forget to do it.</p>



<p>Ah, and always remember, <strong>be quick – have we already said that?</strong></p>



<h3>
<span id="Take_care_of_your_customers%E2%80%99_privacy_know_when_to_answer_in_public_and_when_not"></span><strong>Take care of your customers’ privacy: know when to answer in public and when not.</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Not all the questions are the same.</p>



<p>There may be a frequent question made by an aggressive person, a very technical one, or something too personal – you’ll never know.</p>



<p>If the questions are generic, you can quickly answer them in public, adding links and whatever it takes to make the customer experience more comfortable.</p>



<p>However, if there are more delicate questions, complaints, or aggressive talking, the best thing you can do is <strong>answer in privat</strong>e. Not everything has to be public, and, sometimes, you can better handle a problem with a client when there are only the two of you involved.</p>



<p>Have you ever used these tricks? How did it go?</p>



<h2>
<span id="Conclusions"></span>Conclusions<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Social media platforms are one of the most known places where people can connect with brands.</p>



<p>Thanks to social media, you can <strong>analyze your customers</strong>, what they are discussing, and what they think about your brand.</p>



<p>In this way, you can provide better service by knowing what they need and desire.</p>



<p>Always remember to <strong>be polite and adapt the communication</strong> to the right channel!</p>

<p>One of the reasons I started writing is to learn more. The Feynman technique was an inspiration for this.</p>



<h2><strong>The Feynman Technique</strong></h2>



<p>Richard Feynman was a theoretical Physicist. He won a Nobel prize for his contributions to quantum thermodynamics. In other words, he was a genius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a few minutes, listen to the genius here.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36GT2zI8lVA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Feynman always made sure he had a deeper understanding of concepts, before teaching it to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>There are four steps in the Feynman technique</strong></p>



<ol><li>Pick a topic</li><li>Understand the basics. Write what you understood as if you are teaching a 6th-grade student. Use simple language.</li><li>Look at your notes. Identify what you do not know yet. For example, if you are using jargon, you probably did not understand something. Go back to your source of learning and improve your understanding.</li><li>Review and repeat.</li></ol>



<p>We tend to hide complexities under jargon. In a business meeting or a job interview, a lot of jargon is often a red flag.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate test of your knowledge is when you can convey it to someone else.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Why write?</strong></h2>



<p>Writing is step two and three of the Feynman technique. This is where I try to convey what I understood to others. I make sure to write about the new topics I learn.</p>



<p>But there are more reasons for this.</p>



<ol><li>You share what you learn. It might help others. Even if it only helps one person, it is a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/positive-sum-game">positive-sum game</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>You will have a deeper understanding of what you learned.&nbsp;</li><li>It improves your language proficiency</li><li>It adds to your resume</li></ol>



<p>The last two reasons are a byproduct of continuous writing. It can be immensely helpful in building a great career. In a world that is more global than ever, communication skills and command over English can be the difference between the good and the great.</p>



<p>I have had people reach out to me after reading my blog post. Thanking, appreciating, and criticizing what I write. It makes my day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Learn slowly</strong></p>



<p>I’m a fan of slow learning. When I learn a concept, I try to understand it and apply it in my life the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently I read about second-order thinking and the inverse mental model. I spent a few days with it. I tried applying those in my daily life and work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More on that, in a different blog post.</p>



<p>The point is when you write, you learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>That’s it. There is nothing fancy here. It is a simple technique you can apply in your life to learn more things quicker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus, share what you learn. Be the light the world needs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante!

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

		<p><em>(*) in software development</em><br><em>(**) during almost 20 years of professional journey</em></p><hr><p>Career development ain't easy. There's no single path - equally right for everyone. It's highly contextual, dependent on individual strengths, advantages ... and aspirations. And of course, there's the luck factor - you can amplify an opportunity once you face it but only if you face any ...</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe that some universal learnings could be applied by literally everyone. I've assembled my personal (highly subjective) list ... only to find out that it has quickly got out of control, growing to 10, 15, 20, and even more items. It was hard to question any of them, but I intend to keep a crispy, crystal-clear message - hence the decision to reduce the list to ONLY SIX most important advice.</p><p>First of all:</p><blockquote>1. No-one will manage your career for you; this responsibility is yours and yours only!</blockquote><p>That sounds more than obvious, yet 90% of people ignore that. For some reason, they naively hope their current employer will take care of their future - identify the most promising career direction, push them to develop necessary skills, make sure the work performed spurs the individual growth, etc. That MAY be the case if you're lucky enough to encounter a pristine leader who prioritizes people over KPIs, but ... it occurs very rarely.</p><blockquote>2. There's no (personal) development w/o challenges and goals - everyone needs some stretching and pressure.</blockquote><p>I agree that <strong>it's not the target but the journey</strong> that truly elevates us to the higher levels. But that journey has to have a meaning - we need a direction, an azimuth, and a goal within reach — a goal that is both worthwhile and achievable (according to our own judgment). Pushing tasks through (like a conveyor belt) w/o a broader context and fulfilling milestones quickly gets tedious, repetitive, and ... demotivating.</p><blockquote>3. Successful people "attract" the interesting work - the best way to boost your career is to prove to be effective &amp; reliable (adjust your level to current capabilities, it's OK to start small); stick to successful people first and become one (in time) as well.</blockquote><p>What matters, in the end, is not how well you know Azure or Node.js (sheer skills make you an efficient, expensive TOOL), but whether you're effective (<strong>you get the stuff done</strong>) or not. Engineers who focus on achieving "technical successes" (but rarely add any meaningful business value) tend to be very happy with themselves, though once they disappear from the team - its causative power (counterintuitively) increases. Once you get recognized as effective, you'll act like a magnet to the most attractive opportunities, the best people, and the most exciting technical challenges.</p><p>Get involved, take ownership, lead the way and don't be afraid to take (controlled) risks!</p><blockquote>4. We're all defined by the sum of our unique experiences. Nothing compares (in terms of learning speed &amp; intensity) to the actual battle scars we've acquired in the wild while learning craft the hard way.</blockquote><p>To get more experience (/skills /proficiencies), you need to face new experiences (/situations /challenges /endeavors) - if your work environment is static (conditions don't change) and you've stopped "learning by doing" - you're stuck and wasting time. Employers do realize that and try to "bribe" you with "horizontal promotions", privileges or extrinsic (material) motivators - such a <strong>"golden cage"</strong> is one of the most dangerous career traps. Do you know the difference between "10 years of XP" and "10 x 1 year of XP"? That's exactly the point.</p><blockquote>5. The proper career development model is 'E-shaped person': a versatile generalist with few, diversified areas of specialized expertise.</blockquote><p>Strong engineering foundations, based upon professional curiosity and traditional mental models (we all stand upon the shoulders of giants) are very important, but to make a difference, one should bring some unique flavor (attractive specialty) to the table. However, the tech develops so quickly and in such an unpredictable manner that betting on a single horse is simply too risky. That's why I suggest hedging your specialty: always have a plan B (pro-actively, not re-actively).</p><p>Treat it as the most important investment, <strong>the investment in yourself</strong>. If well made, it can upgrade your career from slow, linear growth to the accelerated, exponential one. </p><blockquote>6. Being a successful software engineer is far less about coding than it seems.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> intensively for more than 4years,
mainly on the servers I administrate. It’s a really powerful &amp; stable (one of the most) OS, with a <em>TONS</em> of package available
trough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">APT</a>.</p>
<p>Debian has helped me in a lot of ways, and I wanted to bring something in return, even the little help I could offer.
So, one year ago I have emailed a friend who is also a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper">DD</a>, to ask him if he’s
willing to become my mentor to help me contribute to Debian. One year ago,
I’ve started, with his help, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/">new maintainer process</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this isn’t a technical guide at ALL, it’s more my opinions &amp; impressions on the Debian maintainer
experience.</p>

<p>You can contribute to Debian in a lot of ways: from translating, submitting bug reports / patches (bugfixes),
help newcomers on forums, help package &amp; maintain software, etc (<a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/help">full list of wanted contributions</a>). It only depends on
your skills, your free time &amp; what you like to do.</p>
<p>I personally wanted to get involved into packaging (TL;DR: help get software into the Debian archive,
so that end-users can install them with apt).</p>

<h2 id="21-learn-how-to-make-a-package-from-scratch">2.1. Learn how to make a package from scratch<a href="#21-learn-how-to-make-a-package-from-scratch" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first step is to learn how to make a package from scratch, so that you can understand exactly how it works,
and therefore be able to investigate future errors. I have used the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro?action=show&amp;redirect=IntroDebianPackaging">following documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I personally have spent 2 weeks reading the documentation, setting up a VM, and trial by errors. I have learned a lot of
things that would help me a lot in the future.</p>
<p>For me, learning to make a package from scratch is a <em>really</em> important step, since it will be the core of your work
as a maintainer. Nowadays, a lot of the package process is automated, especially with the <em>dh-make</em> tools. Therefore,
a lot of stuff is going on under the hood, and not knowing how packaging work will make you struggle when encountering
errors / fixing packaging related bugs.</p>
<h2 id="22-learn-what-to-package">2.2. Learn what to package<a href="#22-learn-what-to-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Once you know how to package stuff, you have to choose what you’re gonna do with this new skill.
Once again, several options are available:</p>
<h3 id="221-create-a-new-package">2.2.1. Create a new package<a href="#221-create-a-new-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This option may be the most interesting, especially if you already have a
software in mind, but you’re gonna ask you a some questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this package will fit in the archive? (copyright, usefulness, etc…)</li>
<li>Do I have enough skills to package this software?</li>
<li>Do I have enough free time?</li>
<li>Doesn’t this package already exist?</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of doubt, always ask somewhere for help. You can use <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/IRC">IRC</a>, <a href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/">mailing list</a>, etc.</p>
<h3 id="222-help-maintain-existing-package">2.2.2. Help maintain existing package<a href="#222-help-maintain-existing-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>There’s a lot of package in <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfh">RFH</a> (request for help). These packages already have
a maintainer, but seeking for help, meaning that he may be willing to help you update / fix bugs on the package, as
well as upload it on the archive for you.</p>
<p>RFH packages are really great since you’ll help an existing maintainer, learn from him, be able to ask questions,
and the maintainer may be willing to advocate you to become a Debian maintainer in the future (see below for more details).</p>
<h3 id="223-take-over-abandoned-package">2.2.3. Take over abandoned package<a href="#223-take-over-abandoned-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Sometimes, maintainer may not have enough time for their packages, and will mark a package <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa">RFA</a> (request for adoption).
These package are basically abandoned, looking for adoption. The maintainer may help you in taking over the maintenance.</p>

<p>When your package is finished (successfully built + tested) you can’t just upload it on the Debian archive. Only DD &amp; <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">DM</a>
can do that.</p>
<p>You’ll have to ask someone with upload rights to review it &amp; upload it for you (this is called sponsoring).</p>
<p>To ease package reviewing you can use <a href="https://mentors.debian.net/">mentors</a> and/or email the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/">debian-mentors</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>Once your first package is on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable">unstable</a>, you will be a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SponsoredMaintainer">Sponsored maintainer</a>!</p>

<p>Once you start mastering the art of packaging, you may candidate to become a Debian Maintainer (DM).</p>
<p>DM are people with a restricted upload rights on the archive. DD can grant them upload rights for specific packages,
so that they will be able to upload without sponsoring.</p>
<p>To become a DM you must go through the <a href="https://nm.debian.org/">new-member process</a>, there’s several steps required such
as getting your PGP uid signed by a DD (to enable trust), being advocated by a DD, agreeing to the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">SC</a>/<a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>/<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.</p>
<p>After completing all steps, your application will stay pending for 4days+ (to allow any objections to be made)
and finally the keyring maintainers will add your key to the Debian keyring, making you a Debian maintainer.</p>

<p>Contributing to such a big &amp; distributed open source project taught me a lot of things, from technical skills such as packaging,
reviewing / submitting patches, arguing about them, reporting bugs, …
To social skills such as asynchronous communication (only email &amp; IRC based) all
around the world, working with a lot of different mindset, culture, <strong>being patient</strong>, humble, etc…</p>
<p>This experience helped me to be a better software developer &amp; human being.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the whole Debian community who is always really helpful &amp; especially Alexandre Viau, my mentor,
who has greatly helped me &amp; pushed me to become a Debian maintainer.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<![CDATA[What ORMs Have Taught Me: Just Learn SQL (2014)]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

We gave the entire backstory in our piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-is-dead-long-live-truenas-core/">FreeNAS is Dead Long Live TrueNAS CORE</a>. With the TrueNAS Core 12.0 release, that brand swap is now done and iXsystems now have a unified platform for both its “free” and enterprise offerings.<span id="more-47847"></span></p>
<h2>TrueNAS 12 Release Key Features</h2>
<p>Many of STH’s readers are going to wait a few weeks to upgrade given the company’s history with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-corral-canned-development-essentially-halted-now/">releases</a>. At the same time, the release is very easy to do for a current system. Under System -&gt; Update, you will see a Train dropdown. You want to select the TrueNAS-12.0-STABLE release train. Then Download Updates.</p>

<p>On our first test system we updated this took a few clicks and a few minutes until we were running TrueNAS core.</p>
<p>For the high-level updates on the new release, here are the key new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ZFS Native Crypto</b>&nbsp;– Per-dataset encryption and support for encrypted replication to untrusted targets.</li>
<li><b>2 Factor Authentication</b>&nbsp;– Allows using Applications such as “Google Authenticator” to provide an extra level of security before logging into the UI or SSH access.</li>
<li><b>KMIP Support</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS Enterprise now adds the ability to interface with KMIP servers for the storage and retrieval of passwords and encryption keys.</li>
<li><b>Performance Improvements</b>&nbsp;– Virtually every area of the platform has been updated and includes some major performance improvements, including SMB, iSCSI, ZFS and more.</li>
<li><b>API Keys</b>&nbsp;– All of TrueNAS can be configured with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/additional-topics/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrueNAS API v2.0</a>&nbsp;and now supports API keys for remote access. The v1.0 API is no longer supported.</li>
<li><b>Fusion Pools</b> – Allows creating pools with all-flash vdevs that store metadata and small-block IO. This provides flash-like performance on all metadata operations, but with the cost-effectiveness of spinning disk for storage blocks.</li>
<li><b>VPN Support</b>&nbsp;– Support for TrueNAS acting as both an OpenVPN Server and Client, depending on your VPN needs.</li>
<li><b>TrueCommand Cloud Integration</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS 12.0 systems can be connected directly to a TrueCommand Cloud account for scaled monitoring and management of your TrueNAS systems</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more on the official <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/intro/release-notes/tn-12_0-release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Now that our systems are moving to TrueNAS Core, FreeNAS is gone.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>You may not have seen this, but STH has actually had a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guides/top-hardware-components-for-truenas-core-servers/">Top Hardware Components for TrueNAS Core Servers</a> for some time. If you are thinking of building a TrueNAS Core server, check that out.</p>
<p>The bigger item looming is TrueNAS Scale. We covered how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ixsystems-starts-de-emphasizing-freebsd-for-truenas-scale-out-project/">iXsystems Starts De-emphasizing FreeBSD for TrueNAS Scale-Out Project</a>. While retiring the “FreeNAS” brand that aligned closely with “FreeBSD” the TrueNAS Scale platform we see as a clear future. With the ability to scale from a single node system like TrueNAS Core into a multi-node cluster, like Proxmox VE already can, the TrueNAS Scale Linux-based solution is where the company is headed longer term. Unifying FreeNAS and the TrueNAS Enterprise line helps the company move in this direction. For now, we do not recommend TrueNAS Scale because it is still an Alpha product, but it is certainly the one to watch.</p>
<p>At your readiness, it is time to do a few clicks, change the release train, and have a beer/ bourbon, or scotch to toast to FreeNAS retirement as the system reboots.</p>

                <h3>Test Automation</h3>
                <p>In today’s delivery methods like Agile and Continuous Delivery, every software dependent business is
                    focused to release quality software products often and faster than ever before.</p>
                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to
                    market the software.</p><br>
            </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Aren’t manual tests really enough?</h3>
                <p>Not considering today’s software delivery needs.</p>
                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

                <h3>Let’s look at a few benefits of Test Automation:</h3>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i></i>

                        <strong>
                            Test Automation speeds up the testing process</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once created, automated tests can be run over and again at no additional cost and can increase
                        the pace of executing tests in different versions of device, browser and OS combinations. This
                        reduces the testing time in each cycle.</p>
                </li>


                <li>

                            Test Automation increases Test Coverage</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>As the tests are automated you can choose to execute some or all of the tests to cover the
                        affected areas. You don't need to compromise on the coverage due to a lack of time towards the
                        end of the cycle.</p>
                    <p>Execute multiple complex tests across different OS/Device/Browser combinations and with different
                        Test Data sets that help increase the test coverage.</p>

                        <strong>Test Automation improves Accuracy</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Test Automation tools execute a set of scripted steps systematically and record the results every
                        time they are executed. The accuracy of results are more in less time compared to Manual
                        testing.</p>
                </li>


                <li>

                            Test Automation allows for faster delivery of products</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the test script is developed, the tests can be re-executed any number of times, anytime.
                        This allows the Functional testers to do exploratory testing and to check for the usability of
                        the product. Test Automation allows for a speedy delivery of better quality products into the
                        market.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>▾ node_modules/

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>In one particular context.</p>


<p>A while back, a colleague wanted to make a major change in the design of a system, the sort of change that was going to take a year or more, and many tens of person-years of effort. They asked me how to justify the project. This post is part of the email reply I sent. The advice is in context of technical leadership work at a big company, but perhaps it may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right solution?</strong></p>

<p>I like to pay attention to ways I can easily fool myself. One of those ways is an <em>availability heuristic</em> applied to big problems. I see a big problem that needs a big solution, and am strongly biased to believe that the first big solution that presents itself is the right one. It takes intentional effort to figure out whether the big solution is, indeed, a solution to the big problem. Bold action, after all, isn't a solution itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, in one of his more exuberant or desperate moods, Pa would go out in the veld and sprinkle brandy on the daisies to make them drunk so that they wouldn't feel the pain of shriveling up and dying. (André Brink)</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I am so easily fooled in this way, I like to write my reasoning down. Two pages of prose normally does it, building an argument as to why this is the right solution to the problem. Almost every time, this exposes flaws in my reasoning, opportunities to find more data, or other solutions to explore. Thinking in my head doesn't have this effect for me, but writing does. Or, rather, the exercise of writing and reading does.</p>

<p>The first step is to write a succinct description of the problem, and what it means for the problem to be solved. Sometimes those are quantitative goals. Speeds and feeds. Sometimes, they are concrete goals. A product launch, or a document. Sometimes, it's something more qualitative and harder to explain. Thinking about the problem bears a great deal of fruit.</p>

<p>Then, the solution. The usual questions apply here, including cost, viability, scope and complexity. Most important is engaging with the problem statement. It's easy to make the exercise useless if you disconnect the problem statement from the solution.</p>

<p>It is important you feel comfortable with the outcome of this exercise, because losing faith in your own work is a sure way to have it fail. Confidence is one valuable outcome. Another one is a simpler solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right problem?</strong></p>

<p>An elegant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all, at least in that it might fool people into thinking that the true problem has been solved, and to stop trying. You need to deeply understand the problem you are solving. Rarely, this will be an exercise only in technology or engineering. More commonly, large problems will span business, finance, engineering, management and more. You probably don't understand all of these things. Be sure to seek the help of people who do.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I think I understand multiple perspectives on a problem, I like to write them down and run them by the people who explained the problem to me. They'll be able to point out where you're still wrong. Perhaps you're confusing your net and operational margins, or your hiring targets make no sense, or your customers see a different problem from you. This requires that the people you consult trust you, and you trust them. Fortunately, non-engineers in engineering organizations are always looking out for allies and friends. Most are, like engineers, only too excited to explain their work.</p>

<p><strong>Engage with the doubters, but don't let them get you down</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you (Tom Lehrer)</p></blockquote>

<p>You will never convince everybody of your point of view. By now, you have two powerful tools to help convince people: A clear statement of the problem that considers multiple points-of-view, and a clear statement of the solution. Some people will read those and be convinced. Others would never be convinced, because their objections lie beyond the scope of your thinking. A third group will have real, honest, feedback about the problem and proposed solution. That feedback is gold that should be mined. Unfortunately, separating the golden nuggets of feedback from the pyrite nuggets of doubt isn't easy.</p>

<p>The doubters will get you down. Perhaps they think the problem doesn't exist, or that the solution is impractical. Perhaps they think you aren't the person to do it. Perhaps they think the same resources should be spent on a different problem, or a different solution. You'll repeat, repeat, and repeat. Get used to it. I'm still not used to it, but you should be.</p>

<p>Again, writing is a tool I reach for. "Today, I'm doubting my solution because..." Sometimes that doubt will be something more about you than the project. That's OK. Sometime it'll be about the project, and will identify a real problem. Often, it'll just point to one of those unknown unknowns that all projects have.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the stakeholders where they are</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, you're going to need to convince somebody to let you do the work. That's good, because doing big things requires time, people and money. You don't want to be working somewhere that's willing to waste time, people or money. If they're willing to waste time on your ill-conceived schemes, they'll be willing to waste your time on somebody else's ill-conceived schemes.</p>

<blockquote><p>May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. (C.S. Lewis)</p></blockquote>

<p>The best advice I've received about convincing stakeholders is to write for them, not you. Try to predict what questions they are going to ask, what concerns they will have, and what objections they will bring up and have answers for those in the text. That doesn't mean you should be defensive. Don't aim only to flatter. Instead, tailor your approach. It can help to have the advice of people who've been through this journey before.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph may seem to you like <em>politics</em>, you may have a distaste for politics, or believe you can escape it by moving to a different business. It is. You may. You can't.</p>

<p>Leadership willing to engage with your ideas and challenge you on them is a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Build a team</strong></p>

<p>You need to build two teams. Your local team is the team of engineers who are going to help you write, review, test, deploy, operate, and so on. These people are critical to your success, not because they are the fingers to your brain, but because the details are at least as important as the big picture. Get into some details yourself. Don't get into every detail. You can't.</p>

<p>Your extended team is a group of experts, managers, customer-facing folks, product managers, lawyers, designers and so on. Some of these people won't be engaged day-to-day. You need to find them, get them involved, and draw on them when you need help. You're not an expert in everything, but expertise in everything will be needed. Getting these people excited about your project, and bought into its success, is important.</p>

<p>Finally, find yourself a small group of people you trust, and ask them to keep you honest. Check in with them, to make sure your ideas still make sense. Share the documents you wrote with them.</p>

<p><strong>Be willing to adapt</strong></p>

<p>You will learn, at some point into doing your big project, that your solution is bullshit. You completely misunderstood the problem. You may feel like this leaves you back at the beginning, where you started. It doesn't. Instead, you've stepped up your level of expertise. Most likely, you can adapt that carefully-considered solution to the new problem, but you might need to throw it out entirely. Again, write it down. Be specific. What have you learned, and what did it teach you? Look for things you can recover, and don't throw things out prematurely.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>



<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/List.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="viewing-assembly-with-disassemble">Viewing Assembly With <code>disassemble</code></h3>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:
nrf_cli.c:
3511	{
3512	    if (nrf_cli_build_in_cmd_common_executed(p_cli, (argc != 1), NULL, 0))
   0x0002969c &lt;+0&gt;:	ldr	r3, [r0, #8]
   0x0002969e &lt;+2&gt;:	ldr.w	r2, [r3, #316]	; 0x13c

nrf_cli.h:
604	    return p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;internal.flag.show_help;
   0x000296a2 &lt;+6&gt;:	lsls	r2, r2, #30
   0x000296a4 &lt;+8&gt;:	bmi.n	0x296b8 &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+28&gt;

nrf_cli.c:
3391	    if (arg_cnt_nok)
   0x000296a6 &lt;+10&gt;:	cmp	r1, #1
   0x000296a8 &lt;+12&gt;:	bne.n	0x296bc &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+32&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Machine-Code.html">Reference</a></p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2
r1             0x7530              30000

          <p><span>Published on: <time datetime="2020-10-05">October 5, 2020</time></span></p><p>I recently completed a major overhaul of <a href="https://github.com/nickbabcock/jomini">a Javascript library of mine</a>. This overhaul replaced a pure JS parser (generated by <a href="https://github.com/zaach/jison">jison</a>) with one that delegated parsing to <a href="https://github.com/rakaly/jomini">an implementation written in Rust</a> compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly (Wasm)</a>. I want to share my journey, as overall it’s been positive and I expect that other JS libraries could benefit from this approach.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The parser in question turns a proprietary format that is akin to JSON and looks like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">tag=AAA
name="Jåhkåmåhkke"
core=BBB
buildings={ 1 2 }
core=CCC
</code></pre></div><p>and returns a plain javascript object</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">{
  tag: "AAA",
  name: "Jåhkåmåhkke",
  core: ["BBB", "CCC"],
  buildings: [1, 2]
}
</code></pre></div><p>So what were the pain points of the original JS implementation?</p>
<h2 id="original-motivation">Original Motivation</h2>
<p>Soon after releasing the JS library I stopped actively developing it. The files that I want to parse are millions of lines long which could result in tens of millions of JS values (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and dates). Parsing and allocating this many objects was taxing enough that back in 2015 I found no way to practically run it – the memory pressure caused nodejs to run out of heap space and when the code didn’t crash, the time required to parse said files would easily reach 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2020, I wrote this parser in Rust. The results have been fantastic: zero-copy parsing at 1 GB/s.</p>
<p>But speed wasn’t the only contributing factor. In fact, I firmly believe that someone could design a performant (but maybe not as performant) of an API around this format in pure JS. The other big motivating factor is accuracy and consistency. In no way do I own or control this proprietary format, so new syntax is stumbled upon all the time. Most recently data like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">levels = { 10 0=1 0=2 }
color = hex { eeeeee }
color = rgb { 0 100 150 }
</code></pre></div><p>So when I doubled down to cover all known syntax in Rust, I couldn’t imagine duplicating that effort for other languages and then keeping the parsing logic in sync. The Rust parser has been battle proven in multiple projects and I don’t want to start from scratch for a new language. To me, it seems preferable to have one implementation and bind others to it. Considering I’ve written this parser in C#, F#, JS, and most recently Rust – anything that cuts down on maintenance work is desirable.</p>
<p>My mind shifted to the JS implementation. Rust can compile to Wasm and both nodejs and browsers can execute Wasm, so rewriting the JS parser to delegate to Wasm seemed like the first step in determining how feasible it is to have all logic contained in Rust.</p>
<p>I should note that .NET languages can utilize Wasmtime to run Wasm, but this is not as mature. I wanted to start prototyping Wasm on the most mature platforms. Part of this process was to test if Wasm is too immature for a given ecosystem. In a fledgling Wasm ecosystem one could still be able to dip down to interoperating with native libraries (though native libraries have their own tradeoffs).</p>
<h2 id="rust-wasm-and-the-js-wrapper">Rust Wasm and the JS Wrapper</h2>
<p>This won’t be a tutorial on Rust and tools (<a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/">wasm-bindgen</a> and <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/">wasm-pack</a>). I suggest reading their respective books and tutorials.</p>
<p>My view is that one should always write a JS wrapper for the Wasm that exposes the Rust code as idiomatically as possible instead of making the Wasm a separate NPM package. To me, an idiomatic design means the loading and compiling of Wasm is entirely user driven. For instance, I have users create instances through a static <code>initialize</code> function that transparently handles the wasm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>import</span> <span>init</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>the_wasm</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js_bg.wasm"</span>;

<span>let</span> <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Jomini</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span>() {}

  <span>/* snip member functions that use wasm functions */</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>initialize</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> () <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span><span>initialized</span>) {
      <span>// @ts-ignore
</span><span></span>      <span>await</span> <span>init</span>(<span>the_wasm</span>());
      <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Jomini</span>();
  };
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that the wasm is cached on subsequent <code>initialize</code> invocations. Small Wasm bundles can still incur a non-negligible performance tax (50 kb compiles in 20ms), so cache them.</p>
<p>And in case you are curious about performance, it’s great! The Wasm implementation can parse a 1.3 million line file in 160ms. Considering parsing it in Rust takes 70ms, I think this is a great outcome. What might come as a bit of a performance shock is that deserializing the parsed data to a JS object takes over 6 seconds! I find this incredible – object creation can be more expensive than parsing. Expensive object creation isn’t restricted to JS either, <a href="https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson#-benchmarks">python is also afflicted</a>. We can fix this with a bit of ingenuity.</p>
<h2 id="wasm-lifetimes">Wasm Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The parser is zero-copy, but as shown it can be too expensive to serialize the parsed data to a JS object. The solution is to do less work: have the user specify the data they are interested in ahead of time using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON pointer</a> syntax. The below example extracts the player and then extracts the <code>prestige</code> field from the player’s country.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> } <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(
  <span>buffer</span>,
  { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> },
  (<span>query</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>"/player"</span>);
    <span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>`/countries/</span><span>${</span><span>player</span><span>}</span><span>/prestige`</span>);
    <span>return</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> };
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>The alternative would be doing the same operations but on the decoded object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>save</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(<span>buffer</span>, { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> });
<span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>player</span>;
<span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>countries</span>[<span>player</span>].<span>prestige</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Querying for just the interesting bits completes 40x faster (6.3s vs 0.16s) and uses about half the memory.</p>
<p>How this query API is accomplished with a zero-copy parser (a struct that has a lifetime to the underlying data) is a bit tricky, as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/423">wasm-bindgen doesn’t let one expose a struct with a lifetime</a>. The solution looks as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Query</span> {
    _backing_data: Vec<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    tape: <span>TextTape</span><span>&lt;</span>'static<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p>This struct works as desired through a two pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We transmute away the lifetime of <code>tape</code> to static so that we can store it in a wasm-bindgen compatible struct. This is the only <code>unsafe</code> operation – and it has to be unsafe as we’re exposing this to JS and Rust can’t borrow check JS usage.</li>
<li>It’s important to own the data that was parsed so that our referenced data isn’t reclaimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also why the API is exposed in a callback, so that the user extracts the data they are interested in and at the end of the callback, <code>Query</code> is freed (a method generated by wasm-bindgen on exposed structs) for the user so they don’t have to worry about manual memory management. This goes back to ensuring that users have an idiomatic API at their disposal.</p>
<h2 id="bundling">Bundling</h2>
<p>This will be the most opinionated section here. I prefer projects with a small number of dev dependencies and a minimal amount of configuration.</p>
<p>Here’s the build step from <code>package.json</code>: we manually call wasm-pack and remove any previous invocations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"wasm-pack build -t web --out-dir ../src/pkg crate &amp;&amp; rm -rf dist/ &amp;&amp; rollup -c"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And the rollup config is also simplistic</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>import</span> { <span>wasm</span> } <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-wasm"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-typescript"</span>;

<span>const</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>=</span> (<span>fmt</span>) =&gt; ({
  <span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/index.ts"</span>,
  <span>output</span><span>:</span> {
    <span>dir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>,
    <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>fmt</span>,
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"jomini"</span>,
  },
  <span>plugins</span><span>:</span> [
    <span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> }),
    <span>typescript</span>({ <span>outDir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> }),
  ],
});

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> [<span>rolls</span>(<span>"cjs"</span>), <span>rolls</span>(<span>"es"</span>)];
</code></pre></div><p>Rollup is used as it’s the best tool to generate both CommonJS and ES modules. CommonJS for the nodejs folks and ES modules for those using bundlers that can take advantage of tree shaking to remove unused code. The tree shaking is partially limited by the support code that the Wasm bundle executes on load (ie: setting up heap), but this shouldn’t be too restrictive especially if the main API of a library uses Wasm. Make sure that your <code>package.json</code> contains the appropriate references to the modules and types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"main"</span>: <span>"./dist/cjs/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"module"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"types"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/lib/index.d.ts"</span>,
  <span>"files"</span>: [<span>"dist"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>For those curious, I’ve eschewed the <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust"><code>@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust</code></a> package as sometimes introducing a middleman doesn’t significantly cut down on code and it introduces another layer to debug when things go wrong.</p>
<p>It’s easy to miss in the config snippet, but the below function inlines our Wasm as a base64 encoded string if our Wasm is less than 100kb (an arbitrarily chosen number that is larger than our bundle)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> })
</code></pre></div><p>The Wasm itself is still compiled asynchronously. If we omitted <code>maxFileSize</code>, then the Wasm file would be generated as a complementary file. An additional file that has to be fetched is not desirable, as it would be surprising behavior for clients who may not be aware of all the implications from direct or transitive dependencies (ie: they may need a build system that understands Wasm if they are deploying to the web). By inlining as base64 we make the Wasm an implementation detail (for node 12+ and the vast majority of browser users). Yes, base64 does cause the Wasm bundle to grow ~33% but this is offset by two factors: compression, so the cost of transferring across the network is less than 33%, and the Wasm bundles generated by Rust tend to be small. As long as one stays cognizant of file sizes this shouldn’t be an issue. For me, the generated Wasm bundle is 54 KB and <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=jomini@0.3.3">bundlephobia lists the total bundle size (JS + inlined base64 Wasm) as 33.4 KB after minification and compression</a>, which is smaller than <code>react-dom</code> (35.6 KB). In my opinion this price is easily justified. If the Wasm bundle is significantly larger, I suspect the likelihood of clients being aware of their dependency implications increases, so one can opt to supply the Wasm bundle as a separate file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>In March, as Covid-19 began sending office workers home across the globe, Facebook realized it had a serious problem. The company relies on a vast army of <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-international-content-moderators/">content moderators</a><strong> </strong>— often low-paid contractors — who are responsible for removing everything from nudity to hate speech and terrorism content. Their work is often sensitive and, therefore, can’t be done outside a formal office. As the world went into lockdown, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/March-18-2020-Press-Call-Transcript.pdf">said</a> during a press call that the social network would lean more on full-time staffers and artificial intelligence to police its platforms.</p>



<p>But, he noted, some of this work would “still be done by teams in person.” One of those teams is located thousands of miles away from the company’s California headquarters in Hyderabad, India, where, as of last year, <a href="https://www.medianama.com/2019/08/223-facebook-contractor-genpact-doubles-minimum-salaries-for-content-moderators-in-india-report/">1,600 Facebook moderators</a> were employed by a third-party contractor called Genpact. This summer, even as Covid-19 cases were surging in India, Genpact moderators said they felt pressured by their employer to come back to the office. While most of Facebook’s full-time employees remain safe at home, these workers have been forced to choose between their health and their livelihoods: stemming the tide of the most unsavory and disturbing posts on the internet.</p>



<p><em>Rest of World </em>spoke with four current and former Genpact employees, all of whom asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the company. They said moderators were asked — in some cases as early as July — to return to the office to tackle sensitive content, including posts involving child exploitation, suicide, and other matter that could lead to real-world harm. Two moderators said that Genpact pressured workers to show up at Facebook’s office in HITEC City, a corporate district home to some of India’s biggest tech companies. Two moderators also reported that Genpact is continuing to shift more employees to work on Facebook content.</p>



<p>In a statement, Genpact said it couldn’t comment on specific relationships with clients, but it asserted that moderators are being asked to come into the office on only a volunteer basis. “To make this manageable, safe, and clear, employees need to sign a weekly form that asks them to voluntarily agree to this,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook also asserted that moderators are working in person only if they choose the option and that most are still doing their jobs from home. “Our focus for reopening any office is on how it can be done in a way that keeps our reviewers safe,” a spokesperson for Facebook said in a statement. “To do this we are putting strict health and safety measures in place, making sure they’re followed, and addressing and disclosing any confirmed cases of illness.”</p>



<p>With few opportunities for other work, the moderators who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> said they still felt like they had no choice but to show up in person. A senior moderator said that Genpact employees were also informed they could lose their jobs if they didn’t come to the office. “The operations team told them these are important orders,” said the moderator. “There’s a threatening factor behind [it].”</p>



<p>“People are forced to go to work, even if they are not happy to,” they added. Genpact denied that it incentivizes anyone to work in person. The company emphasized that coming into the office “is voluntary, and we remind each employee that their decision has no impact on benefits, pay, or status.” </p>



<p>In the middle of a pandemic and subsequent recession, it’s not clear where the Genpact moderators would go if they lost their jobs. “During Covid times, many companies are holding off on new recruitments,” said R. Chandra Sekharam, a commissioner with the Labour Department of Telangana, the Indian state where Hyderabad is located.</p>



<p>In March, an IT company that shares an office building with Facebook made a grim announcement: one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Fears of contracting Covid-19 soon swept the city. Hostel owners and other landlords in Hyderabad, afraid that tenants working in large offices would bring the virus home with them, began evicting people who work in business process outsourcing (BPO) and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to two Genpact moderators, that included some of their colleagues working for Facebook. When they reached out to Genpact asking for help finding a new place to live, one employee said the plea fell on deaf ears. “There’s no help being given by the company,” they told <em>Rest of World</em>. Genpact denied the claim and said it worked with authorities to stop evictions and offered some people alternative housing.</p>





<p>Just two days after that first case of Covid-19 was announced, Genpact employees were asked to return to work in Facebook’s office, according to one moderator who was called back. In May, the<em> </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/18/facebook-google-work-from-home/"><em>Washington Post</em></a><em> </em>reported that Facebook had offered extra pay to moderators in the U.S. who voluntarily agreed to return to work. The Genpact workers told <em>Rest of World</em> that no such bonus was extended to them in India.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the moderators said that their salaries, which amount to less than $2 an hour, were supplemented by food benefits, received either in the form of in-office meals or through a prepaid meal card. One moderator described the perk as coming directly from Facebook. But when Genpact employees were sent home during India’s Covid-19 lockdown, the benefit disappeared. During an internal Facebook meeting leaked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"><em>The Verge</em></a><em> </em>in September, Zuckerberg fielded a question from a staffer at the company’s California headquarters, who complained about the lack of free snacks available while they worked from home. But for reviewers in India, meal benefits were more than just a cushy perk: They were a crucial supplement to their low incomes. (Genpact says that it is continuing to provide packed meals and snacks for on-site workers.)</p>

<p>Moderators who have returned to Facebook’s office in Hyderabad say they are unhappy but also afraid of losing their jobs. “Calling people in [to work] in such situations is completely unprofessional,” one former moderator told <em>Rest of World</em>. That person left Genpact after being sent home in March but remains in contact with former coworkers. “Genpact is doing it because there aren’t any jobs, and people are getting laid off. So people are too scared to actually say anything. And I think that’s what Genpact is taking advantage of.”</p>



<p>Contractors, unlike Facebook’s full-time employees, have almost no leverage to demand changes to their working conditions, says Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. Despite accounting for a core part of Facebook’s business, contract moderators “are viewed as replaceable cogs in a machine,” he says.</p>



<p>Facebook has also been criticized for its treatment of domestic content moderators. In May, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/854998616/in-settlement-facebook-to-pay-52-million-to-content-moderators-with-ptsd">$52 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit filed by reviewers in the U.S., who alleged the traumatic nature of their work led to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Facebook admitted no wrongdoing, but as part of the settlement, the company vowed to improve labor conditions. Yet contractors have continued to report problems, particularly during the pandemic. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"><em>The Verge</em></a> reported that Facebook moderators at the third-party firm Accenture said they were ordered to report to their offices in Austin, Texas, without any explanation or extra pay. (Facebook said the work done by the Austin team can’t be done from home.)</p>



<p>Mithun Roy, a managing consultant at the outsourcing firm Avaya, says that companies like Genpact can charge more for employees who work directly from a client’s office than from an outsourcing site. When clients like Facebook request a firm’s services, Roy says they have to be as detailed as possible, including disclosing where the work will be performed. According to Roy, a yearlong contract from a client like Facebook can be worth millions of dollars.</p>



<p>“Management doesn’t want to miss this opportunity,” the senior Genpact moderator told<em> Rest of World</em>. That person said the company has been pushing moderators to work on-site at Facebook’s Hyderabad office even as Covid-19 cases have skyrocketed in the city, in order to gain an advantage over competitors less comfortable sending workers in person. “Even after the pandemic ends, this could [mean] new workstreams for us,” the senior moderator said.</p>



<p>Genpact and Facebook aren’t the only entities pushing contractors in Hyderabad to return to normal. The city’s economy is increasingly reliant on business from multinational tech companies. It’s been home to Microsoft’s regional headquarters since 1998, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/amazon-hyderabad-india.html">the largest Amazon office</a> in the world opened there last year. As the pandemic progressed, and many workers left the city for their hometowns, officials began fearing that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/lay-offs-loom-over-it-sector-in-hyderabad-telangana-govt-urges-centre-to-act-11588317514170.html">Hyderabad’s tech industry would soon experience massive layoffs</a>.</p>

During India’s lockdown and subsequent reopening, IT companies were considered “essential” by the government, allowing them to skirt certain coronavirus regulations placed on other businesses. According to a state minister in Hyderabad, this designation predates the pandemic: It’s meant as a guarantee to multinational companies that their outsourced workforces won’t be disrupted.</p>



<p>Activists and health care workers <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/COVID-19-Telangana-Govt-Grossly-Under-Reporting-Cases-Activists">have warned</a> that the state of Telangana “vastly” underreported cases of Covid-19 and deaths related to the virus.

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

For the first time now, researchers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (also known as “KIT”) in Germany have succeeded in developing a computer system that outperforms humans in recognizing spontaneously spoken language with minimum latency.&nbsp;</p><p>This is reported on the Internet platform <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=NDU0NGNmMDY0ZjgyZTUxNGVhNDA1Y2FlYTg2MTFmODhjYmE1NzRiMCxmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603543067">ArXiv.org</a>.</p><p>“When people talk to each other, there are stops, stutterings, hesitations, such as “er” or “hmmm”, laughs and coughs,” says Alex Waibel, Professor for Informatics at KIT. “Often, words are pronounced unclearly.” This makes it difficult even for people to make accurate notes of a conversation. “And so far, this has been even more difficult for AI,” adds the speech recognition expert. KIT scientists and staff of KITES, a start-up company from KIT, have now programmed a computer system that executes this task better than humans and quicker than other systems.</p><p>Waibel already developed an automatic live translator that directly translates university lectures from German or English into the languages spoken by foreign students. This “Lecture Translator” has been used in the lecture halls of KIT since 2012. “Recognition of spontaneous speech is the most important component of this system,” Waibel explains, “as errors and delays in recognition make the translation incomprehensible. On conversational speech, the human error rate amounts to about 5.5%. Our system now reaches 5.0%.” Apart from precision, however, the speed of the system to produce output is just as important so students can follow the lecture live. The researchers have now succeeded in reducing this latency to one second. This is the smallest reported latency reached by a speech recognition system of this quality to date, says Waibel.</p><p>Error rate and latency are measured using the standardized and internationally recognized, scientific “switchboard-benchmark” test. This benchmark (defined by US NIST) is widely used by international AI researchers in their competition to build a machine that comes close to humans in recognizing spontaneous speech under comparable conditions, or even outperforming them.</p><p>According to Waibel, fast, high accuracy speech recognition is an essential step for further downstream processing. It enables dialog, translation, and other AI modules to provide better voice based interaction with machines.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kit.edu%2Fkit%2Fenglish%2Fpi_2020_095_ai-outperforms-humans-in-speech-recognition.php&amp;t=NDRjNTA2NWExNjA1ZjBjNGMwMTMwOWIzODUzNDExNTI3MmVkZDk0ZCxmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603543067">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b> “Super-Human Performance in Online Low-latency Recognition of Conversational Speech”,&nbsp;ArXiv.org.<br></p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=NDU0NGNmMDY0ZjgyZTUxNGVhNDA1Y2FlYTg2MTFmODhjYmE1NzRiMCxmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603543067">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03449</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632109737244311552/nuance-va-speech-recognition">VA expands telehealth services with speech recognition cloud platform</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago I added <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-clarifies-jamstack-remarks#comment-344626">this comment in WPTavern</a>, on an article where WordPress founder's Matt Mullenweg clarifies his earlier remarks that the Jamstack is "a regression for the vast majority of the people adopting it".</p><p>Since I like owing my own content, I reproduce it here in my own blog.</p><hr><p>I think Matt’s brutal honesty is welcome, because most information out there about the Jamstack praises it. However, it also comes from developers using these modern new tools, evaluating their own convenience and satisfaction. As Matt points out, that doesn’t mean it makes it easier for the end user to use the software, which is what WordPress is good at.</p><p>I actually like the Jamstack, but because of how complex it is, it’s rather limiting, even to support some otherwise basic functionality.</p><p>The definitive example is comments, which should be at the core websites building communities. WordPress is extremely good at supporting comments in the site. The Jamstack is sooooo bad at it. In all these many years, nobody has been able to solve comments for the Jamstack, which for me evidences that it is inherently unsuitable to support this feature.</p><p>All attempts so far have been workarounds, not solutions. Eg:</p><ul><li>Netlify forms: no hierarchy, so can post a comment but not a response (unless adding some meta to the comment body? how ugly is that?)</li><li>Storing comments in a GitHub repo: it takes a long time to merge the PR with the comment</li></ul><p>Also, all these solutions are overtly complicated. Do I need to set-up a webhook to trigger a new build just to add a comment? And then, maybe cache the new comment in the client’s LocalStorage for if the user refreshes the page immediately, before the new build is finished? Seriously?</p><p>And then, they don’t provide the killer feature: to send notifications of the new comment to all parties involved in the discussion. That’s how communities get built, and websites become successful. Speed is a factor. But more important than speed, it is dynamic functionality to support communities. The website may look fancy, but it may well become a ghost town.</p><p>(Btw, as an exercise, you can research which websites started as WordPress and then migrated to the Jamstack, and check how many comments they had then vs now… the numbers will, most likely, be waaaaaaay down)</p><p>Another way is to not pre-render the comments, but render them dynamically after fetching it with an API. Yes, this solution works, but then you still have WordPress (or some other CMS) in the back-end to store the comments :P</p><p>The final option is to use 3rd parties such as Disqus to handle this functionality for you. Then, I will be sharing my users’ data with the 3rd party, and they may use it who knows how, and for the benefit of who (most likely, not my users’). Since I care about privacy, that’s a big no for me.</p><p>As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it.</p><p>I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community! So, as Matt says, there are things the Jamstack can handle. But certainly not everything. And possibly, not the one(s) that enable your your website to become successful.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Network programming is something that can be tricky in every programming language. Fortunately all network programming makes use of BSD sockets, a paradigm that almost universal in all modern operating systems and programming languages.</p><p>In this article, I'll show you how you can program sockets in Lisp using the SBCL implementation. You see, the Common Lisp specification has no specification for socket programming. So every Lisp compiler is free to specify it's own implementation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a first version of this article and only focusses on writing a Lisp server. I'll update this article later to include a Lisp client.</p><div id="general-flow-for-sockets">
<h2>General flow for sockets</h2>
<p>All systems making use of network sockets follow a similar flow. The flow does differ between client and server implementations.</p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>create a socket</strong> and set the desired <strong>socket options</strong>. Next you have to <strong>bind</strong> the socket to a specific address. An <em>address</em> in socket programming is a combination of an IP address and a port number. After the socket is bound to an address, the server can listen to incoming connections of clients.</p>
</div><div id="writing-a-lisp-server">
<h2>Writing a Lisp server</h2>
<p>Let's start by writing a simple server in Lisp. Note that this code won't work just yet, follow along.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>#(</span><span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>

        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen</span> <span>server</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First we define two parameters, <strong>address</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. The <strong>address</strong> parameter is a vector respresenting the <em>IP address 0.0.0.0</em>. The <strong>port</strong> parameter is the integer 8080. Binding our socket to this address will let it listen on all IP addresses of the computer we run this program on.</p>
<p>In the <em>start-server</em> function we first create a socket by creating an instance of <em>inet-socket</em>. Next we set the options and then bind it to the address. Finally we start listening on the socket.</p>
<p>Next we have to accept any client connections and handle those connections. For our example we will create a server that will echo everything a client sends and then close the connection.</p>
<p>Let's update our <em>start-server</em> function to accept connections and pass the connection to a handler function. To make reading from the socket a bit easier, I've added a helper function <em>read-from-connection</em>.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>As you can see we had to do some processing of the data received from the socket. Our function <em>read-from-connection</em> reads up to 1024 bytes from the connection. Lisp has to <em>allocate</em> an entire buffer of that length, but only a certain number of bytes are received. So we simple return the part of the buffer equal to the length of the data written.</p>
<p>In the <em>handle-connection</em> function, we read data from the connection using our helper function. Then we simply send that data back to the connection by using the <strong>socket-send</strong> function, and finally close our socket by making use of the <strong>socket-close</strong> function.</p>
<p>To connect to our server you can use the telnet command on your computer:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>michael@winston:~<span>|</span>⇒  telnet <span>127</span>.0.0.1 <span>9000</span>
Trying <span>127</span>.0.0.1...
Connected to <span>127</span>.0.0.1.
Escape character is <span>'^]'</span>.
Lisp is amazing!
Lisp is amazing!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see the telnet commands establishes a connection. We then enter something ("Lisp is amazing!" in my example) and press enter. The server immediately echos back what we sent it and closes the connection.</p>
<p>The complete example up untill now can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">simple echo server</a> file.</p>
<div id="handling-multiple-client-connections">
<h3>Handling multiple client connections</h3>
<p>Our design has one important flaw. Because of the way our server handles connections, only one connection can be handled by our server at a time.</p>
<p>You can test this out by connecting two telnet sessions to our server, just connect but don't send anything just yet. If you send a string to our server on the second telnet session, you won't get an immediate reply. The connection will stay open, without a response, untill the first session is finished. Send something through the first telnet session and you'll notice the second session will get a response and close after the first session does.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the flow of our server, you'll see that our loop that accepts connections is 'kept busy' by our <em>handle-connection</em> function. We can't accept new connections while our <em>handle-connection</em> function hasn't finished. In this particular case, the impact is negligible: since we simple read, send and then close the connection we will quickly return to the loop accepting connections. But image if our connection handler would keep the connection alive and read multiple times from a connection? Bad design!</p>
<p>Luckily, we can easily fix this by starting a new thread for each connection and handle the connection in the new thread.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>sb-thread:make-thread</span>
        <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>; Handle our connection in this lambda, which is run in a new thread</span>
            <span>(</span><span>loop</span>
                <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
                    <span>; Do something with the data received</span>
                    <span>))</span>
            <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>))))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We changed our <em>handle-connection</em> function to make a new thread. That thread will spin off from the main server thread and continue on its own. While the thread is running it's own loop in this case, the server is free to accept new connections that will be handled by threads of their own.</p>
<p>If you test our server with two telnet session like we did before, you'll notice our server now responds as expected. The fact that one client was connected first, but hasn't finished yet, makes no difference when handling a second client.</p>
<p>The full example can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">threaded echo server</a> file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><code><span>io_uring</span></code> is a new asynchronous I/O API for Linux created by Jens Axboe from Facebook. It aims at providing an API without the limitations of the current <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> family of system calls, which we discussed in the previous section. Given that users of asynchronous programming models choose it in the first place for performance reasons, it makes sense to have an API that has very low performance overheads. We shall see how <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves this in subsequent sections.</p><div id="the-io-uring-interface">
<h2>The io_uring interface<a href="#the-io-uring-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The very name io_uring comes from the fact that the interfaces uses ring buffers as the main interface for kernel-user space communication. While there are system calls involved, they are kept to a minimum and there is a polling mode you can use to reduce the need to make system calls as much as possible.</p>

<div id="the-mental-model">
<h3>The mental model<a href="#the-mental-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mental model you need to construct in order to use <code><span>io_uring</span></code> to build programs that process I/O asynchronously is fairly simple.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are 2 ring buffers, one for submission of requests (submission queue or SQ) and the other that informs you about completion of those requests (completion queue or CQ).</p></li>
<li><p>These ring buffers are shared between kernel and user space. You set these up with <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_setup.html#c.io_uring_setup" title="io_uring_setup"><code><span>io_uring_setup()</span></code></a> and then mapping them into user space with 2 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls.</p></li>
<li><p>You tell io_uring what you need to get done (read or write a file, accept client connections, etc), which you describe as part of a submission queue entry (SQE) and add it to the tail of the submission ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You then tell the kernel via the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> system call that you’ve added an SQE to the submission queue ring buffer. You can add multiple SQEs before making the system call as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> can also wait for a number of requests to be processed by the kernel before it returns so you know you’re ready to read off the completion queue for results.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel processes requests submitted and adds completion queue events (CQEs) to the tail of the completion queue ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You read CQEs off the head of the completion queue ring buffer. There is one CQE corresponding to each SQE and it contains the status of that particular request.</p></li>
<li><p>You continue adding SQEs and reaping CQEs as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>polling mode available</span></a>, in which the kernel polls for new entries in the submission queue. This avoids the system call overhead of calling <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> every time you submit entries for processing.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div><div id="io-uring-performance">
<h2>io_uring performance<a href="#io-uring-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because of the shared ring buffers between the kernel and user space, io_uring can be a zero-copy system. Copying bytes around becomes necessary when system calls that transfer data between kernel and user space are involved. But since the bulk of the communication in <code><span>io_uring</span></code> is via buffers shared between the kernel and user space, this huge performance overhead is completely avoided. While system calls (and we’re used to making them a lot) may not seem like a significant overhead, in high performance applications, making a lot of them will begin to matter. Also, system calls are not as cheap as they used to be. Throw in workarounds the operating system has in place to deal with <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Specter and Meltdown</a>, we are talking non-trivial overheads. So, avoiding system calls as much as possible is a fantastic idea in high-performance applications indeed.</p>
<p>While using synchronous programming interfaces or even when using asynchronous programming interfaces under Linux, there is at least one system call involved in the submission of each request. In <code><span>io_uring</span></code>, you can add several requests, simply by adding multiple SQEs each describing the I/O operation you want and make a single call to io_uring_enter. For starers, that’s a win right there. But it gets better.</p>
<p>You can have the kernel poll and pick up your SQEs for processing as you add them to the submission queue. This avoids the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> call you need to make to tell the kernel to pick up SQEs. For high-performance applications, this means even lesser system call overheads. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>the submission queue polling tutorial</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p>With some clever use of shared ring buffers, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> performance is really memory-bound, since in polling mode, we can do away with system calls altogether. It is important to remember that performance benchmarking is a relative process with some kind of a common point of reference. According to the <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring paper</a>, on a reference machine, in polling mode, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> managed to clock 1.7M 4k IOPS, while <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> manages 608k. Although much more than double, this isn’t a fair comparison since <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> doesn’t feature a polled mode. But even when polled mode is disabled, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> hits 1.2M IOPS, close to double that of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a>.</p>
<p>To check the raw throughput of the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface, there is a no-op request type. With this, on the reference machine, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves 20M messages per second. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-liburing/submission.html#c.io_uring_prep_nop" title="io_uring_prep_nop"><code><span>io_uring_prep_nop()</span></code></a> for more details.</p>
</div><div id="an-example-using-the-low-level-api">
<h2>An example using the low-level API<a href="#an-example-using-the-low-level-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing a small program that reads files and prints them on to the console, like how the Unix <code><span>cat</span></code> utility does might be a good starting point to get your hands wet with the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API. Please see the next chapter for one such example.</p>
</div><div id="just-use-liburing">
<h2>Just use liburing<a href="#just-use-liburing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While being acquainted with the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API is most certainly a good thing, in real, serious programs you probably want to use the higher-level interface provided by liburing. Programs like <a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> already use it. If liburing never existed, you’d have built some abstraction layer over the low-lever <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface. liburing does that for you and it is a well thought-out interface as well. In short, you should probably put in some effort to understand how the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface works, but by default you should really be using <code><span>liburing</span></code> in your programs.</p>
<p>While there is a reference section here for it, there are some examples based on <code><span>liburing</span></code> we’ll see in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL has become a widely adopted standard over the past few years. However, not everyone is taking advantage of the full capabilities of the standard. In this article, I’ll demonstrate methods for creating more expressive schemas that better fit your data needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start by defining an example scenario. We’re building a forum application, which will have several types of users:</p><ul role="list"><li>Standard users that post and read content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Moderators that oversee forum postings and police activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Administrators that manage the operations of the forum. For example, dealing with technical issues, assigning moderators, and more.</li></ul><p>What might a schema for such a site look like? Let’s start off with a barebones schema. This example will be using a Node Express and GraphQL project. I’ll assume you already know how to do that, but I will include the entire project code at the bottom of the article later. Create a typeDefs.ts file like this. Notice that we’re using TypeScript, since the type annotations help make the code more clear.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
import { gql } from "apollo-server-express"; 
 
const typeDefs = gql` 
  type StandardUser { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
 
export default typeDefs; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>You’ll notice that we have the three user types, and an additional type called Category, which represents the group that our posts will go into. However it’s clear there is repetition across our fields (e.g. id, username). It’s in fact possible to pull out a “base type” from each of the three user related types. Let’s attempt to do this by updating this schema using Interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Interfaces&nbsp;</h3><p>An interface is just a skeleton of sorts. It’s a contract that declares rules, in this case specific fields, however it has no implementation and therefore cannot return data. Only types can. However since it does provide structure, we are using Interfaces to define base fields and then have our types implement those Interfaces. For example, if we update our typeDefs with Interfaces it could look like this.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
const typeDefs = gql` 
  interface Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
  } 
 
  interface User implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  interface Rating { 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type StandardUser implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator implements Identifiable &amp; User { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>If we start at the top, you’ll see our first interface is called Identifiable. Since all of the entities in our data model have a unique ID, this interface will be the base for all of our entities. Next, we see that the User interface implements the Identifiable interface. Notice how User has both the id field and its own field called userName. When a type or interface implements an interface, they must implement all of its fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next up we have another interface called Rating. Since two of our types StandardUser and Moderator use the stars field, but Administrator does not, we have this interface so that only the types that use the stars field can implement it – otherwise, the User models can skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we finally have our actual types StandardUser, Moderator, and Administrator, where each one implements only the interfaces it needs by using an &amp; symbol to denote more than one interface being implemented. Then lastly the Category type.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see this set of types and hierarchies is quite reminiscent of most modern programming languages, for example TypeScript.</p><p>We now have a reasonable schema model. Let’s try querying it. Update the typeDefs variable by adding this Query.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
type Query { 
    getAllUsers: [User!] 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>As you can see, we’ve added a function that retrieves all of our site’s users, but returns them as an array of Users. Let’s now write our resolver and see if this will work. First create your resolver file like the following:</p><div><pre><code>
import { IResolvers } from "apollo-server-express"; 
import { getAllUsers, User } from "../dataService"; 
import { GqlContext } from "./GqlContext"; 
 
const resolvers: IResolvers = { 
  Query: { 
    getAllUsers: async ( 
      parent, 
      args: null, 
      ctx: GqlContext, 
      info: any 
	): Promise<array<user>&gt; =&gt; { 
      return getAllUsers(); 
	}, 
  }, 
}; 
 
export default resolvers; 
</array<user></code>
</pre></div><p>Our resolver’s only action is to call our getAllUsers function in order to retrieve the actual data. You’ll notice that our getAllUsers resolver is returning an array of User Interfaces. This should be a bit suspicious, but for now let’s just see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must implement the getAllUsers function in code. But to make this article simpler and focus on GraphQL we’ll create a function that returns hard coded values. Create a file called dataService.ts and add this code.</p><div><pre><code>
import { v4 } from "uuid"; 
 
export interface Identifiable { 
  id: string; 
} 
 
export interface User extends Identifiable { 
  userName: string; 
} 
 
export interface Rating { 
  stars: number; 
} 
 
export class StandardUser implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Moderator implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number, 
    public categories: [Category] 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Administrator implements User { 
  constructor(public id: string, public userName: string) {} 
} 
 
export class Category implements Identifiable { 
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {} 
} 
 
export function getAllUsers() { 
  const users: Array<user> = []; 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "dave", 4)); 
  users.push(new Moderator(v4(), "ruth", 5, [new Category(v4(), "Cooking")])); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "jane", 5)); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "tom", 1)); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "linda")); 
  users.push( 
    new Moderator(v4(), "tom", 2, [new Category(v4(), "Programming")]) 
  ); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "betty")); 
 
  return users; 
} 
</user></code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>Our dataService contains all of our TypeScript types that mirror our GraphQL schemas, as well as the getAllUsers function that returns a list of objects that inherit from our User Interface. As you can see, getAllUsers all types of Users, including StandardUsers and Administrators, but since they all implement the User interface (i.e. User is the parent type for all of them), the function’s return type is set as an array of User types. Now let’s try querying it!</p><h3>Querying and Fragments</h3><p>Open your GraphQL playground by opening your browser to the GraphQL server URL, which would be something like http://localhost:&lt;port number&gt;/graphql. Then add this Query as shown.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
query { 
    getAllUsers { 
  	... on User { 
        id 
        userName 
  	} 
	} 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>This is our Query for getAllUsers, but instead of fields we see three periods. What we’re seeing with the “…” is called an inline Fragment. This tells the GraphQL service which type of data we are looking for. In this case we indicate that we want the Interface User and its fields of id and userName.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s try and run this Query, but when we do we get this error shown.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-b158e79301e4-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def7201d623778ea438_PIIAWDJ_AhMP0A-vvcjwUNoHCg_WvzU_ih_MejA2hzeijfi7RI3lHvNq5pXadUM2JbGzIVoT0Ny2XqAveRkYRh7ow7xWHMnBfFIIkg6g0iXm9uHKclOT1FdRUyMomCxlR0xJr80.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.6 First query error&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>What does this error mean? If we look back at our definition of GraphQL Interfaces we said they only have declarations, but no implementations. Therefore, we need to replace the interface with an implementation of the interface, the type, that does return data. Let’s see how to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Update the resolvers variable by adding this code.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
User: { 
    __resolveType(obj: any, ctx: GqlContext, info: any) { 
      if (obj.categories) { 
        return "Moderator"; 
  	} else if (obj.stars) { 
        return "StandardUser"; 
  	} 
 
      return "Administrator"; 
	}, 
  }, 
</code>
</pre></div><p>By defining the User Interface in our resolvers we are telling GraphQL that when it encounters the User in a Query it should instead return one of the specific types listed.

                <p>We’re uncovering the Armory Agent for Kubernetes: a more flexible, scalable, and secure way for Spinnaker to interact with your Kubernetes infrastructure.</p>

<p>Spinnaker monitors your Kubernetes infrastructure constantly so it can display the infrastructure to users, know how to version your services, and more. Spinnaker reaches out to each cluster, retrieves all the Kubernetes objects it is configured to, computes various relationships, and stores the result in its cache.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png"></p>
<p>While powerful, this unobtrusive discovery mechanism has given rise two types of issues when handling a larger number (100s or 1000s) of Kubernetes clusters: <strong>performance and account management</strong>.</p>
<h2>Caching Performance</h2>
<p>With a large number of clusters, performance can be degraded as the same data is retrieved over and over – even when nothing has changed. Spinnaker repeats the process for each cluster and each namespace<sup>1</sup>. The Agent takes a different approach, listening to changes at the cluster level and streaming them back to Spinnaker. Changes to your infrastructure – whether Spinnaker initiated or not – show up in “real time” in Spinnaker’s cache, all over a single TCP connection per cluster.</p>
<h2>Using the Cache</h2>
<p>The Agent also comes with an optimized storage that allows some nice performance improvements – made possible by adopting Kubernetes and RDBMS-specific storage.</p>
<p>Below are some examples we saw during the development of the agent:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png" alt="" width="768" height="663" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-360x311.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics.png 912w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png"></p>
<h2>Account Management</h2>
<p>In its <a href="#agent-mode">Agent mode</a>, the Agent simplifies Kubernetes account management within Spinnaker. Instead of a centralized account management model, where all of your Kubernetes service accounts and credentials are stored within Spinnaker, the Agent sits within each Kubernetes cluster and manages accounts from there. This enables individual teams to manage credentials and permissions for their respective clusters, and allows you to add or delete new accounts on the fly without restarting Spinnaker.</p>
<h2>Added Bonus: Enhanced Security</h2>
<p>The Agent provides an added bonus by enhancing security. It allows you to keep your Kubernetes API servers private from Spinnaker, and restricts the information leaving the cluster to only what Spinnaker needs to operate. Individual teams can also easily rotate or remove Kubernetes configs as needed.</p>


<p>The Agent acts as Spinnaker’s gateway to Kubernetes. It comes in two parts: a lightweight Golang program that gives you a lot of deployment flexibility – we’ll get back to that shortly – and a plugin to Spinnaker. Let’s set it up in our Spinnaker installation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png"></p>
<p>Installing the Agent is straightforward, especially if you already use the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/installation/operator/">Spinnaker Operator</a>. Follow the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-agent/armory-agent-quick/">quick start</a>, and deploy:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plugin to Clouddriver: this will be what the Agent will connect to. A new (gRPC) port will be open.</li>
<li>a <code>Service</code> that points to Clouddriver’s gRPC port.</li>
<li>a <code>Deployment</code> of the Agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above configuration, you’d just define accounts in the Agent – not in Clouddriver anymore. With a simple bit of yaml, a HELM chart, or a kustomize template, teams can inject the Agent&nbsp; into newly provisioned Kubernetes clusters and immediately make them a software deployment targets. Like other parts of Spinnaker, the Agent fully implements secret management so you can store your <code>kubeconfig</code> files in one of the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/secrets/#supported-secret-engines">supported secret engines</a> or just provision them via the method of your choice as Kubernetes secrets.</p>
<p>The Agent will also detect configuration changes and reload the list of accounts immediately. So we could keep updating agent accounts in a separate <code>configMap</code>.<br>
<a name="agent-mode"></a></p>

<p>The great thing with cloud providers – or with a dose of infrastructure automation – is that it’s easy to spin up new Kubernetes clusters. We see application teams more and more in charge of their own infrastructure. In this context, deploying with Spinnaker often becomes a game of cat and mouse to get your cluster information into the hands of the ops team.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of tooling developed over the years. What if we could skip that step? Behold! That’s why it’s called Armory Agent for Kubernetes</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png" alt="" width="768" height="411" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-1024x548.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-360x193.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Agent-mode-768x411.png"><em>“for” Kubernetes is because lawyers and trademark.</em></p>
<p>In this mode, the Agent is installed in the deployment target cluster by the provisioning tool (e.g. Terraform) – alongside your monitoring and logging infrastructure – or separately via scripts.</p>
<p>The Agent is also configured with Spinnaker’s endpoint and the proper authentication (mTLS, JWT, …). When it starts, it will register to Spinnaker and the account will automatically be available for caching and deployment.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the cluster is deleted – or if you just uninstall the Agent, the account will be removed from Spinnaker after a grace period.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud/">Armory Cloud</a>, Armory’s new SaaS offering. It is a big reason we doubled down on the Agent. With the Agent and the model above, Armory can help you deploy to your infrastructure (public or private), does not need any credentials, and can be revoked at anytime by customers.</p>
<p>A different strategy is to manage groups of clusters. This can be useful in an environment where the control plane does not have direct access to your cluster but cluster information is still centralized. But it can also be helpful to group clusters geographically close, belonging to the same business unit, or with a similar network topology.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png" alt="" width="768" height="417" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-1024x557.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-360x196.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-1536x835.png 1536w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/agent-infra-mode-768x417.png"></p>

<p>If you’re interested, please <a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-spinnaker-as-a-service/">reach out</a>. We’re in early release and now is your time to help shape the deployment service of your dreams.</p>

<p>The Agent is currently in Early Release and is being used by select Armory customers. We’re encouraged with our early results and are iterating quickly. The Agent is compatible with Armory Spinnaker as well as open source Spinnaker, so please <a href="https://www.armory.io/contact-us/">reach out</a> if you want to take it for a spin. Also, join us for a <a href="https://spinnakersummit2020.sched.com/event/fND7"><span>lunch &amp; learn</span></a><span> about the Agent on 11/4 during the </span><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/"><span>Spinnaker Summit and Gardening Days.</span></a></p>
<p><em>Footnotes:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Fortunately, Spinnaker is highly instrumented and if you know what metrics to watch for, there is surely a knob to turn to correct it. Note that there is an effort currently underway to improve the situation and we expect Spinnaker caching performance to greatly improve over the next few releases!</em></p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is very common that we want to compute an integral for some $f(x)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[I = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx\]

</p><p>However, in some circumstances, the analytical result of the expected value might not be derived easily if $f(x)$ is very complex.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to compute an integral approximately using Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="law-of-large-numbers">Law of Large Numbers</h4>

<p>Law of large numbers states that for random variable $X$ with $\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu$ and $\mathbb{Var}[X] = \sigma^2$ and we also have a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, the sample average random variable</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\]

</p><p>converges to $\mu$</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_{n} \rightarrow \mu, \text{ when } n \rightarrow \infty\]

</p><p>This means that for any random variable, if the number of random samples is sufficiently large, the average of random samples from the i.i.d random variables will be sure to be the population mean $\mu$.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>, except that the law of large numbers did not tell the distribution of sample average random variable will become a Gaussian distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</p>



<p>Therefore, to estimate $\mathbb{E}[X]$, we prepare $n$ random samples $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ from i.i.d random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, and $n$ is sufficiently large.</p><p>

\[\mathbb{E}[X] \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\]

</p><h3 id="riemann-integral-and-riemann-sum">Riemann Integral and Riemann Sum</h3>

<h4 id="riemann-integral">Riemann Integral</h4>

<p>Riemann integral is actually the definition of the definite integral.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = \lim_{||\Delta x|| \rightarrow 0}^{} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>

<h4 id="riemann-sum">Riemann Sum</h4>

<p>Following Riemann integral, Riemann sum provides a way to compute the definite integral approximately.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>



<p>As a special case of Riemann sum, suppose the volume of $\Omega$ is $V$, where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We evenly divided the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, then $\Delta x_i = \frac{V}{n}$. We further set $x_i^{\ast} = x_i$. We have the Riemann sum</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \frac{V}{n} \\
&amp;= \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The advantage of Monte Carlo integration over Riemann sum is that for some $\Omega$ it is easier to do random sampling in $\Omega$ than evenly diving $\Omega$.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-integration">Monte Carlo Integration</h3>

<p>Monte Carlo integration is somewhat similar to Riemann sum. However, instead of evenly dividing the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, we randomly sample $x_i$ from $\Omega$. The expression of the formula remains almost the same as the special case of Riemann sum we discussed above though.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>and $x_i$ is a random sample of $X_i$ which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables defined in $\Omega$ that follows <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>By definition, we have the expected value for an arbitrary function.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We set $p(x) = \frac{1}{V}$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} \frac{1}{V} f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{V} \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = V \mathbb{E}[f(X)]\]

</p><p>According to the law of large numbers, since $f(X)$ is a random variable, $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ could be computed approximately by sampling. That is to say, we have $n$ i.i.d random variables, $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, and we randomly sample $f(x_1), f(x_2), \cdots, f(x_n)$ for $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, respectively. To do such sampling for $f(X_i)$, we sample $x_i$ for $X_i$ uniformly from $\Omega$, following by computing $f(x_i)$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;= V \mathbb{E}[f(X)] \\
&amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Here we would take a look at the applications of Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h4 id="compute-pi-approximately">Compute $\pi$ Approximately</h4>

<p>To be honest, I have totally forgotten how $\pi$ is formally computed. However, with some prior knowledge about $\pi$ and circle, we could compute $\pi$ approximately.</p>



<p>We define a circle whose center is located at $(0,0)$ with a radius of $r = 1$. Formally, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. With our prior knowledge, we know the area of this circle is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
S &amp;= \pi r^2 \\
&amp;= \pi
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, to compute $\pi$ approximately, we just have to compute the area of the circle approximately.</p>



<p>We define $\Omega = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and a function $f(x, y)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x, y) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{else}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
I &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy \\
&amp;= S \times 1 \\
&amp;= S \\
&amp;= \pi \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that the integral $I$ is actually the volume of a cylinder which equals to $\pi$, instead of the area of the circle.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\pi = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy\]

</p><p>To compute the integral approximately, we could either use Riemann sum or Monte Carlo integration. Here we use Monte Carlo integration to compute the integral.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
V &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} dx dy \\
&amp;= 4
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could then write a compute program to help us finish the following sampling tasks.</p>
