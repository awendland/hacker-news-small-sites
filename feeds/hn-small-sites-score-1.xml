<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Early ventures don't start with optimization. You begin with a big, bold bet that whatever you’re going to make will cause a revolution. Your product goes through several iterations, entirely transforming throughout the process. You test the strength of a founder's dream.</p><p>Products at this stage are simple, characterized by one 'killer' feature. Often the product doesn't have the chance to fulfill the advertised value and that's okay. The goal at this stage is to validate the appetite of the users: attract them, disappoint them, and leave them hungry for more.</p><p>Product development in this context is chaotic. No roadmap, mostly negative feedback, no clear sense of progress, and definitely no certainty when the next pivot will come. No one knows how the product will look in a month. It's the 'build things that don't scale' phase, taking shortcuts that somewhat work and dealing with most problems later.</p><p>This is where your headlight comes in: product analytics. You use product analytics to drill down what works and what doesn't. Product analytics also tell you if people are actually using your product: you choose a 'North Star' metric that guides your company in the right direction and tells you if your efforts are bearing fruit.</p><p>Then, the company moves on to the next phase. The road ahead becomes clear, product development becomes more linear, and the product itself stabilizes. It's all about doing more of the same thing. You start to build things that scale. It's the beginning of the optimization phase.</p><p>Your roadmap is clearer, traffic grows, the product becomes more and more complex and dynamic. A variety of variables start to influence the way your product performs: marketing, sales, product development, customer success, support, business development, partnerships, promotions, etc.</p><p>You realize all of a sudden the data that helped you find your feet is overwhelming you. You're swimming in data from more and more sources about how your user-base is growing, how people are interacting with your brand and your product. As your data stack grows larger and your dashboards multiply, you start getting the feeling that you’re missing something vital.</p><p>In this fast-growing deluge of data, a missing piece comes into play: product observability. Product observability keeps track of user behavior all the time, at the finest level of granularity to the highest level of abstraction.</p><p>There are many reasons why people change their behavior. Adjustments to the product, holidays, a new offering from a competitor, changing habits, etc. Product observability is capable of spotting those changes and flagging the issue as a problem or, perhaps, an opportunity. Product observability analyzes all your data all the time, noticing the finest-grained changes to overarching trends.</p><p>Product observability is proactive. Product observability informs you that something needs your attention due to a change in user behavior. Or, you learn that what you're doing is working really well and you need to double-down on your efforts. You get details on the origin of the changes and the impact it could have on your business.</p><p>Once you've reached the market with your product, you already know that you're creating value for people. But now the question becomes how much value can you capture? And for how many users? Product observability optimizes your product's ability to create value by automatically giving you feedback on what you need to fix and keep on doing.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying proactive analytics, sign up for Lantern's early access program <a href="https://lantern.so/">here</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to our newsletter</p><div><div><p>Thank you!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Some people are not satisfied with a webcam from their notebook or an old webcam
they bought many years ago.</p>
<p>My brother decided he wants to try streaming. Some people can just do a thing
and other people want to research all the bits and pieces beforehand. Our chat
history is comparable in length to all my other chats combined, so I learned a
lot of it as well. The craft is full with small details and inconveniences.</p>
<p>He found that there are basically no good webcams. A lot of the time an image
quality is meh, and the rare presence of 4k is usually not better than 1080p,
because resolution is not quality. Some camera apparently does upscaling from
1080p to 4k in its driver, indicated by poor quality and high CPU load. He also
has a really good camera, Fujifilm X-T1. It can't be used as a webcam when
connected to a USB port. Usually it's possible to buy an HDMI-to-USB converter,
but his camera can't output a live stream into HDMI, only a recorded video.</p>
<p>So we had an idea — maybe it is possible to create a good webcam
ourselves. Would anybody care? Well, it’s almost 2021 now, streaming is still on
the rise, pandemic is going strong and video meetings are everywhere. People are
willing to spend some money, as indicated by countless videos on YouTube
regarding the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start with defining what is a good webcam.</p>
<p>A good webcam, in my opinion, is a device that provides a decent sound quality,
at least on par with recent MacBooks, and an image quality on par with top
smartphones, such as iPhone 11/12, Huawei P40 Pro, etc. As smartphones have a
good image quality, then we could probably manufacture a webcam from smartphone
parts that are cheap and easily available. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>If you’ve read at least a couple of articles on the topic of video production,
you will know that to make quality content from the technical standpoint you
need three things, in that particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's discuss these properties and later how to manufacture it.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound<a href="#sound" aria-label="Anchor link for: sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If you have a recent MacBook, it provides a decent sound quality with its
three-mic array. I haven't researched it and don’t know much about other
notebooks' audio quality. If you have a desktop PC, you have to have some
external mic anyway.</p>
<p>If the web camera has shitty audio quality, you’ll have to buy additional
gear. When I researched the topic, one of the recently released webcams
(available from October 2020) with RRP of $180 was producing a sound as if a
person sits in a big plastic barrel with a closed lid. Their voice was very
muffled with lots of resonant rattles. That level of quality wasn’t acceptable
10 years ago, how this piece of gear could have been produced in 2020 escapes my
understanding.</p>
<p>There are many good enough USB mics for $50+, you also can buy a great XLR
microphone for $100, but then you’ll need an external sound card with phantom
power supply. A decent one can easily cost you $200.</p>
<p>With almost any of these options you’ll have to install and configure some
software that will provide sound level compression, noise suppression (because
your notebook fans are spinning like hell) and won’t produce clicks in the
process.</p>
<p>I would like my webcam to do this by itself, no rattling, minimized echo, etc.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light<a href="#light" aria-label="Anchor link for: light">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A lot of what makes a picture great comes from lighting the scene in a correct way.</p>
<p>The simplest thing is to sit in a room so the window is in front of you and the
Sun isn’t shining into a lens from behind your shoulder.</p>
<p>Webcam cannot provide decent lighting capabilities by itself, so I won’t spend
much time here. There is a <a href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo/RZ19-02320100-R3M1">webcam by
Razer</a>
with a built-in LED circle, but it’s necessarily small, always shines from a
webcam direction and is mostly a gimmick.</p>
<p>We can rely somewhat on the good sensor here. If it provides good dynamic range,
HDR capabilities and good low-light performance, then a patch of sunlight on the
wall won't turn everything else black, or a poorly lit room won't turn into a
gray noisy picture with a bleak silhouette.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality<a href="#image-quality" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-quality">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to get a good lens and image sensor into a notebook lid, because
lids are very thin. They’re often something like 4 mm thick all together, and
there is no escaping physics. Of course, it's possible to put a webcam into a
thick part below the lid, but then it'll be useful for expressing anger at our
colleagues with wide-open nostrils and not much else.</p>
<p>Maybe some crazy engineer in the future will develop an array of small sensors
with an array of tiny lenses and somehow combine all that into a good image
quality, but we don't have this tech yet. Any smartphone with a good camera has
that camera with an ugly protruding lens as a thickest part of the phone.</p>
<p>So, if you want something better than a notebook's webcam, you can get some
Logitech webcam with an image quality going back to 2012. It’s still better than
a laptop, but nowhere close to current smartphones.</p>
<p>What if you want better still? The next option is to install an app on the phone
and use it as a webcam. This gives a very good image quality, but it’s very
inconvenient and in some applications doesn’t work at all. For some reason it
isn’t always presented in applications as an option when choosing a video
source.</p>
<p>I don’t want to constantly attach, detach, charge my phone and tune the position of
a small tripod. What’s the next option?</p>
<p>The next option is to just buy a mirrorless photo-camera with a big fat 4/3” or
even APS-C sensor. It will cost $500+ for a new one (you can buy used for
cheaper). You will also need some gear to hold the camera in place, as it won’t
just rest on the top of the screen like a regular webcam. You also need an
HDMI-to-USB video grabber, and you need to be sure that the camera you buy can
output full resolution live onto that HDMI. Also make sure that it's possible to
turn off all on-screen info like <code>1/100s F3.5 ISO 800</code>, which is useful when
you're shooting photos and videos through viewfinder, but not so much when
you're in a video meeting. This feature is called "Clean HDMI".</p>
<p>Of course, you will have a lot of control over the whole stuff — set a
diaphragm, get good bokeh, set ISO, set white balance, etc. Do you actually need
it? Well, some of you do, and a lot of you do not. I learned all that stuff when
I was 16, but now I’m pretty happy with how my phone chooses everything for me
and just does great photos.</p>
<p>All that sounds pretty involved, isn’t it? It is a lot of time to research what
you need, how to set it all up, and a lot of money too.</p>
<h3 id="manufacturing-it">Manufacturing it<a href="#manufacturing-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: manufacturing-it">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So there is a market gap between so-so webcams for $100-200 and a full-blown
setup with a mirrorless camera, an external mic and lighting panels that will
cost almost a grand or two, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>I thought that it is a good idea to create an "upmarket" webcam for $250-300
that will provide good audio and video quality, on par with current smartphones,
actually using the same parts. As smartphones are made in tens of millions, all
relevant parts should be cheap and easily obtainable.</p>
<p>I quickly contacted some people who could help me do the project — firmware
engineer, electric engineer and a company that does mechanical design.</p>
<p>What features are needed for a good webcam for streamers and video meetings?
Audio: good parts (mics and ADC), good mechanical design and assembly (so
nothing would rattle), and some post-processing. We certainly want some
beam-forming capabilities to be able to focus on the person in front of the
webcam, so we will need more than one microphone, maybe up to 4. These parts are
easy to obtain, there are many in stock, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>Even if I think that 4k is not needed, I’m pretty sure it’s really a requirement
to have in an upmarket webcam, as it will be really hard to sell a pricey webcam
that can only do 1080p.</p>
<p>Also would be very nice to have some neural network inference on the chip, so we
can run some AI stuff directly on the webcam without bothering a user’s computer
that can be busy with other things.</p>
<p>I easily found a three-piece assembly for the iPhone 11 Pro for fifty bucks,
two-piece from a Huawei P40 Pro for twenty five and a one-piece from P40 Lite for
ten dollars. That’s with a lens, and bought in retail. Does it mean it costs
peanuts (less than $5 for a sensor) to buy in bulk to produce my own webcam?
Well... Maybe. I can’t just go and buy a couple thousands of these sensors. I’m
pretty sure I can buy a couple thousands of replacement parts for phones, but
sensors themselves are not sold freely. It's easy to buy some "random" sensor
that was around for years and most certainly has "meh" quality by today's
standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and
low-light performance.</p>
<p>I wrote to several vendors asking them what are the prices and conditions, and
basically their answer is either silence or “we’ll sell it if you will buy
hundreds of thousands per year”.</p>
<p>I've found suitable System-on-Chips, and it's the same — if we want to have
hardware 4k encoder, it's either "sorry, it was a demo part and we don't do it",
or "we have limited support capabilities, so we can only sell if you will buy
hundreds of thousands, maybe you want some SoMs from our partners?". It is
actually possible to buy System-on-Modules even in very small quantities, but
it's going to be pretty expensive and will be good for a prototype, but for
production it will blow past our budget. System-on-Module will cost almost the
same as the web camera itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and a lead time (from order to shipment) is systematically 16+ weeks. It
means they have no stock and will place an order at semiconductor foundry, have
it produced, packaged and sent to customer. Swiftly.</p>
<p>It means I cannot just build five hundred webcams, see how good are they selling
and build a couple thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a plastic injection step that requires upfront investment to
manufacture molds, and of course design and engineering costs. All combined it
was tens of thousands …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section>
<p>In this post, I'm going to show the design of a functional program which
solved a difficult problem while being easy to get right and performant.
By avoiding mutation, we were also able to implement "time-travel" to
look how an action would affect the future, easy rollbacks and stale
data detection.</p>
<p>In OOP, there are often deep call-stacks, which I consider a smell
itself, and mutation of state and side-effects often happen at a deep
level. When constructing an application which should be mostly pure with
immutable data, we have to push the side-effects up the call-stack to
the outer boundary. This means that we need to return to the caller
rather than keep diving deeper in the call-stack.</p>
<p>To recap some terminology:</p>
<p>pure<br>
Given the same arguments, it returns the same result. And it has no
effect (other than generating heat) on the outside world. This means no
visible mutation, and no visible side-effects.</p>
<p>immutable<br>
Once a value is set, it cannot be changed. "Mutation" is done by
constructing a new copy rather than modifying in place.</p>
<p>side-effect<br>
A modification to state outside the local environment.</p>
<p>There are some key parts in the architecture I'm demoing here:</p>
<p>State<br>
A record containing all state in the application</p>
<p>Operation<br>
A small language of verbs which describes changes to <code>State</code></p>
<p>ApplicationEvent<br>
Some external event which should trigger changes to our state</p>
<p>Handler<br>
A function which maps from an <code>ApplicationEvent</code> to an <code>Operation</code></p>
<p>You don't need an event driven application to take advantage of the
architecture in this post. Using just immutable state with pure
functions to change the state, will still yield most of the benefits.
Having events and a custom language might be a nice addition, or it
might be over-engineering.</p>
<p>Given the above parts, the flow of the application is then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something triggers an <code>ApplicationEvent</code></li>
<li><code>Handlers</code> translates to <code>Operations</code></li>
<li>We run each <code>Operation</code> on the <code>State</code>, producing an updated <code>State</code></li>
<li>We use the new state for fun and profit</li>
</ul>
<p>When the new state is produced, we can act on the result by interpreting
the changes. We might validate the changes. We might save to the
database. We might detect stale data by rerunning the application. We
might use it for transactions. Our production implementation does all
this, not just without any side-effects or mutation, but <strong>because</strong>
there are no side-effects or mutations. We can safely rerun things,
throw away things, copy, interpret results, and there are never a chance
of introducing an error outside of our changes – Changes in one place
can never affect something else.</p>

<p>We'll go through the key parts of our <a href="https://github.com/simendsjo/functional-christmas-2020_functional-architecture-demo/blob/main/Small.fs">Small</a> demo.
More/different comments are in the actual source file, so I encourage
you to look there as well.</p>
<p>The demo will model changes to an Order Line in an online shopping
chart. It's probably completely overkill for such use, but it's
difficult to create good examples – see an actual use-case in the Large
demo.</p>
<p>We can Add an OrderLine, we can Increment and Decrement the count, and
we can Remove an OrderLine. To make things a bit more interesting, I
also added a Reset and Add with another initial count than 1.</p>
<p>We'll use an integer as a unique id for the OrderLine, and a integer for
the actual count and initial value.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Key</span> <span>=</span> int
<span>type</span> <span>Value</span> <span>=</span> int</code></pre></div>
<h2>Defining a custom language for our domain</h2>
<p>We encode the possible operations on an OrderLine using a Discriminated
Union (also called a Sum Type). These operations are the verbs in our
domain, and our Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) for
manipulating OrderLine items.</p>
<p>Only Set is needed to support our described operations, but we create
some more constructs in our language. Putting more in the language will
make mapping events to operations simpler as the language is more
expressive, at the cost of a more complex language. It's difficult to
decide what goes in the language, and what should only be helper
functions. If you need to distinguish between different operations (e.g.
increment vs set) when interpreting the operations, having them as
separate operations might be a good idea.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Operation</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>|</span> Set <span>of</span> <span>(</span>Key <span>*</span> Value<span>)</span>
    <span>|</span> Reset <span>of</span> <span>Key</span>
    <span>|</span> Remove <span>of</span> <span>Key</span>
    <span>|</span> Incr <span>of</span> <span>Key</span>
    <span>|</span> Decr <span>of</span> <span>Key</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Application state as an immutable record</h2>
<p>The State is where we hold information about all OrderItems. The state
includes things necessary to execute our lanugage. In addition, we keep
things which is convenient for other usecases, but could in theory just
as well be held in other structures. The <code>Audit</code> field is a list of all
operations which has been executed, which makes it easy to do things
like maintaining an audit log, persisting changes, detecting stale data,
rollback transactions, and so on.</p>
<p>Our last field, <code>LastPersisted</code>, is state for the interpreter which
persists changes to disk. Depending on the interpreter and application,
this state might be better to keep separate.</p>
<p>Having a single structure makes it easy to have a clean architecture
without much boilerplate (just <code>State -&gt; State</code> functions), but it can
be difficult to find out what information is used where, and who changes
what. As with any decision, it's a tradeoff, but having a simple
architecture might be more beneficial than a clean separation of state –
remember, there is no mutation or side-effects in the functions which
operates on the state!</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>State</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    Data <span>:</span> <span>Map</span><span>&lt;</span>Key<span>,</span> <span>(</span>Value <span>*</span> Value<span>)</span><span>&gt;</span> 
    Audit <span>:</span> <span>Operation</span> list
    LastPersisted <span>:</span> <span>Operation</span>
<span>}</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>member</span> Empty <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        Data <span>=</span> Map<span>.</span>empty
        Audit <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span>
        
        LastPersisted <span>=</span> Remove <span>-</span><span>1</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Helpers for "manipulating" state, i.e. State -&gt; State functions</h2>
<p>As you start creating mappings from <code>ApplicationEvent</code> to <code>Operation</code>,
you'll quickly see patterns repeating for state querying and
manipulation. I like to extract these to helper functions as I go. For
our demo, I've created three helper functions.</p>
<p>Notice that the design here is to "never fail", and rather just return
sensible defaults instead. This of course depends on the application,
but this demo is modelled after our production application, which should
never fail to process an event.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span><span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span></span>
<span>let</span> defaultInitial <span>=</span> <span>1</span>


<span>let</span> getValue <span>(</span>key <span>:</span> <span>Key</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>state <span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>(</span>Value <span>*</span> Value<span>)</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>|&gt;</span> Option<span>.</span>defaultValue <span>(</span>defaultInitial<span>,</span> defaultInitial<span>)</span>

    <span>let</span> initial<span>,</span> _ <span>=</span> getValue key state
    setInitialAndValue key initial value state</code></pre></div>
<h2>Interpreting our language and executing on State</h2>
<p>With the helper functions, we're now able to process our language. We'll
look at each operation, and manipulate the state accordingly. As a final
step, we log the operation we've executed. Even though we "execute" the
language, we're not mutating any existing state or doing any
side-effects. We're creating a new state as we go. It's thus important
that we use immutable/persistent datastructures that's fast for such
use, and that we're using them correctly e.g. by prepending to the list
rather than appending.</p>
<p>You might notice a <code>print</code> inside here, and scream SIDE-EFFECT! And yes,
it's true, but it's for demo purposes, and you shouldn't do this :)</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>let</span> execute <span>(</span>op <span>:</span> <span>Operation</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>state <span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> State <span>=</span>
    <span>match</span> op <span>with</span>
    <span>|</span> Set <span>(</span>key<span>,</span> value<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
        setValue key value state
    <span>|</span> Reset key <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>let</span> initial<span>,</span> value <span>=</span> getValue key state
        setInitialAndValue key initial value state
    <span>|</span> Remove key <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span> state <span>with</span> Data <span>=</span> Map<span>.</span>remove key state<span>.</span>Data <span>}</span>
    <span>|</span> Incr key <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>let</span> _<span>,</span> value <span>=</span> getValue key state
        setValue key <span>(</span>value <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> state
    <span>|</span> Decr key <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>let</span> _<span>,</span> value <span>=</span> getValue key state
        setValue key <span>(</span>value <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> state
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>fun</span> state <span>-&gt;</span>
        printfn <span>"Executed %A"</span> <span>op</span>
        <span>{</span> state <span>with</span> Audit <span>=</span> op <span>::</span> state<span>.</span>Audit <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Interpreting our language and auditlog to persist to database</h2>
<p>Now that we have a way of changing the state, we can write an
interpreter that runs side-effects. This simulates writing to a
database. Remember that this interpreter has its state in <code>State</code>, so it
has to return a copy of it. In Haskell, this would be a
<code>State -&gt; IO State</code> function as it has side-effects, but in F#, we just
do side-effects without help from the type-system. The interpreters can
be made more efficient by avoiding unnecessary work. [Add 1, Remove 1]
can be reduced to a noop.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>let</span> persist <span>(</span>state <span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> State <span>=</span>
    state<span>.</span>Audit
    <span>|&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span>takeWhile <span>(</span><span>fun</span> op <span>-&gt;</span> <span>not</span> <span>(</span>obj<span>.</span><span>ReferenceEquals</span><span>(</span>op<span>,</span> state<span>.</span>LastPersisted<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span>rev
    <span>|&gt;</span> Seq<span>.</span>fold <span>(</span><span>fun</span> state op <span>-&gt;</span>
        printfn <span>"Saving %A"</span> <span>op</span>
        <span>{</span> state <span>with</span> LastPersisted <span>=</span> op <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span> state</code></pre></div>
<h2>Mapping application events to our custom language</h2>
<p>We still haven't hooked our implementation up to the outer application,
but let's do this now. The key part is our <code>Handler</code> function which does
the mapping. It can access the state in case it needs to look at
anything, and it returns an <code>Operation option</code> in case the
<code>ApplicationEvent</code> should trigger a change in the state. An alternative
implementation could return <code>Operation list</code> instead to support 0+
rather than just 0-1. For events which should trigger more than one
change, we can just write multiple handlers, which is what we did in our
production application. In retrospect, a list would have been more
expressive, and might have made some mappings more readable.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>ApplicationEvent</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>member</span> <span>val</span> Key <span>=</span> key <span>with</span> get<span>,</span> set

<span>type</span> <span>Handler</span> <span>=</span> State <span>-&gt;</span> ApplicationEvent <span>-&gt;</span> Operation option</code></pre></div>
<p>Given an event has happened in the application, we need a way to run
this through all possible handlers, accumulating the changes. This
implementation runs in sequence, where each handler will see the changes
done by the previous. Depending on the use-case, you might want to run
them in parallel, merging the result, or similar.</p>
<div data-language="fsharp"><pre><code><span>let</span> handle <span>(</span>handlers <span>:</span> <span>Handler</span> list<span>)</span> <span>(</span>ev …</code></pre></div></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h3 id="lets-start-with-a-story">Let’s start with a story…</h3>
<p>A quadrillion years ago, I used to work for companies none of which had automated tests in place and believe it or not,
testing was not that popular; We wrote the code, tested manually on our local machines, deployed our newly committed
piece of art and called it a day. If however, something went wrong, we tried to replicate the issue on a test environment,
fixed it, deployed the fix and so on, usually hoping that the fix wouldn’t introduce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression">regression</a>.</p>
<p>Then, writing unit tests somehow gained traction and became popular among developers who liked following best practices but still,
there was a lot of ground to be covered in fast-moving startups and agencies, where delivering projects is a time-sensitive thing.
I even remember debating the lead developer of a VC-backed startup, who at some point insisted that testing is a waste of time and that’s why they didn’t do it.</p>
<h4 id="so-is-testing-our-code-a-waste-of-time">So, is testing our code a waste of time?</h4>
<p><strong>No, it’s not!</strong> Believe it or not though, this was (hopefully isn’t anymore) a somehow acceptable opinion a few years back.
While testing may require some development time, it actually helps save enormous amounts of time if done properly.</p>
<p>Let’s think of the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>A developer works on Feature X for a few days, completes their work and pushes code to the testing environment.</li>
<li>Then, a QA or the developer themselves tests manually, finds a couple of issues which are then fixed and the project hits production.</li>
<li>The code then interacts with user-input or other existing data in a database and errors occur.</li>
<li>The Product Owner raises a ticket, assigns the QA, the QA reproduces the issue, adds technical information to the ticket, sends it to the developer,
they apply a fix and the ticket goes back n forth between the stakeholders until the code hits production.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, there might be regression issues and the back n forth continues until at some point the ticket closes, while several others have been raised.</p>
<p>Chaos? Yes. Reminds you of something? It certainly does for me. This was the daily, fire-fighting routine for the lead developer that was mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Having an efficient and detailed testing suite in place, saves you some of this trouble; The code and tests are written, the QA does what they’re supposed to do,
(make sure the finished product meets certain quality standards), instead of getting blocked becaused they stumbled upon a tiny mistake that could have been caught beforehand.
Ideal? Maybe. Let’s now break down the several ways we can save time.</p>
<h4 id="testing-is-a-safety-net-but-also-a-documentation-and-developer-onboarding-tool">Testing is a safety net, but also a documentation and developer onboarding tool</h4>
<p>Usually, the scope of a function is (or should be) limited and, depending on the input, there are certain outcomes.
Covering a few default cases, should be a nice way to test said function and save ourselves (and the QA) some time being stopped by runtime errors that would easily be prevented.</p>
<p>If however not all cases were covered and some bug gets reported, it’s fine (in fact great!) because this means we’re enhancing the testing suite with another case,
making our code even more resilient.</p>
<p>Along with this benefit, there lies another: Tests are a great (yet, not the only) documentation and onboarding tool, which
means that they should be clear, descriptive and be able to provide a high level overview of what the code should accomplish.</p>
<p>For example, here is an excerpt from a few tests I wrote for a Django view that launches deployment operations:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>it_creates_and_runs_an_operation_given_a_commit_reference</span><span>(</span><span>mock_user</span><span>,</span> <span>create_operation_data</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status_code</span> <span>==</span> <span>201</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'id'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>'kind'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'deployment'</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>is_running</span>

<span>def</span> <span>it_creates_and_runs_an_operation_without_a_commit_reference</span><span>(...):</span>
    <span># ....
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>is_running</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>mock_celery_task</span><span>.</span><span>call_count</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>reference</span> <span>==</span> <span>expected_commit_information</span><span>[</span><span>'reference'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>it_does_not_start_the_operation_when_another_is_queued_prior_to_it</span><span>(...):</span>
    <span># Create an operation that is queued prior to the one we're queueing
</span>    <span>prior</span> <span>=</span> <span>operation_factory</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(...)</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status_code</span> <span>==</span> <span>201</span>
    <span># ...
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>can_start</span><span>()</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>is_running</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>mock_celery_task</span><span>.</span><span>call_count</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>operation</span><span>.</span><span>is_queued</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We now have of tests, groupped together with descriptive names, that provide an outline
that an operation can be started with or without a given reference, and what the expected statuses for the model in the database
and the returned HTTP status code should be. When I revisit this example in the future, or whenever a new hire joins the project,
it will hopefully be obvious to them, what the expected behavior should be without having to read long documentation.
Also, it covers three of the most common cases in the system, related to the “operations” feature.</p>
<h4 id="keeping-tests-fast--testing-the-right-things">Keeping tests fast &amp; testing the right things</h4>
<p>Assuming you are using a web framework like Django or Ruby on Rails and you need to test an ORM or an ActiveRecord model,
it doesn’t make any sense to test the <code>.save</code> or <code>.get</code> methods, because they’re already tested for you by
the amazing people that build the framework of choice. However, testing a custom validator you have
added to your model is a requirement.</p>
<p>The scope of a test should be limited as well. Let’s take the following real-world example where we use pytest (with some syntactic sugar)
to test a <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/index.html">celery task</a> that starts a queued deployment operation.
The <code>create_container</code> function runs a Docker container, but testing this is a) out of the given scope and b) slow if we create the actual container.
The solution to this issue would be to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock</a> the <code>create_container</code> call within the current scope:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>pytest</span><span>.</span><span>mark</span><span>.</span><span>django_db</span>
<span>def</span> <span>describe_start_operation_task</span><span>():</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>it_runs_the_task</span><span>(</span><span>queued_deployment</span><span>,</span> <span>mock_container</span><span>):</span>
        <span>allow</span><span>(</span><span>tasks</span><span>).</span><span>create_container</span><span>.</span><span>and_return</span><span>(</span><span>mock_container</span><span>)</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>task_id</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>not</span> <span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>container_id</span>

        <span># run the task
</span>        <span>celery_task</span> <span>=</span> <span>tasks</span><span>.</span><span>start_operation</span><span>.</span><span>s</span><span>(</span><span>operation_id</span><span>=</span><span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>).</span><span>apply_async</span><span>()</span>

        <span># make sure the deployment fields were populated accordingly
</span>        <span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>refresh_from_db</span><span>()</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>task_id</span> <span>==</span> <span>celery_task</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
        <span>assert</span> <span>queued_deployment</span><span>.</span><span>container_id</span> <span>==</span> <span>mock_container</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz">Sandi Metz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kytrinyx">Katrina Owen</a> in their
great book <a href="https://sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 Bottles of OOP</a>, clearly and constantly state that
the tests should run upon every line of code that gets changed and they’re right. In practice, this
means that you should be able to run all your test suite as fast as possible.</p>
<p>In our example, we managed to save quite some time by mocking the docker container creation, which
is handled internally by a well tested library. Other examples might include external network requests,
big files loaded, email sending etc.</p>
<p>You might also have noticed in my examples that there is a certain degree of duplication. This is fine.
The tests are not a place to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>; they
should be explicit and detailed in order for the other person to be able to understand every tiny bit of the process,
but also, doing fancy things usually leads to errors and you do want your tests to be straight-forward and valid.</p>
<h4 id="meet-your-new-best-friends">Meet your new best friends</h4>
<p>In the examples provided above, I introduced a few concepts that you might not be familiar with so far,
but will become your new best friends when you dive deep into testing: Factories, Fakes, Fakes, Stubs and Mocks.
Here’s some basic guidelines that would help you decide what you need each time:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want an object and with random data, register a factory.</li>
<li>If you need an object with specific, predictable data, go for a fixture.</li>
<li>If you need a simplified version of a method or a class, with limited functionality, fake it.</li>
<li>If you need a set of predefined data returned by a method, stub it.</li>
<li>If you just need to count the calls to a method, mock it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-having-a-proper-test-suite-improves-your-code">How having a proper test suite improves your code</h4>
<p>Writing code with testability in mind, eventually leads to cleaner code, simply because in order to keep the tests simple,
one has to write short-scoped code that is limited to specific things. Long methods that do several things
are as hard to test as to maintain so, having testability in mind, meaning that you <strong>have</strong> to test such pieces of code,
practically acts as an incentive to keep the code maintainable.</p>
<p>Finally, refactoring and cleanup tasks, are a lot safer when the code is covered by reliable tests that will
stop your deployment when something breaks, which makes such tasks a breeze for the developer.</p>
<h4 id="theres-no-strategy-thats-better-than-others">There’s no strategy that’s better than others</h4>
<p>I am aware that picking a testing strategy and policy could be a difficult task, however I don’t think that a team should stress about it, also it should be a choice
that’s adapted to the team’s modus operandi, so that they adapt easily to it and it doesn’t seem like a huge shift from what they had been doing so far.</p>
<p>If the team wants to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> and that’s something that suits the project,
it should be OK. If the team doesn’t feel OK about doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> where they should write tests in advance,
that should be fine as well, because the purpose is to save the team’s time, not force strict policies.
I am aware that methodologies exist for a reason, but experience shows that as long as the team are not practicing
<a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/fear-driven-development-fdd">FDD</a>, it should be OK.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>No matter how experienced or good we are at what we do, we will make that mistake. In order to avoid that annoying RuntimeError that
will disrupt our user’s delightful experience, we have to make sure that our code works well no matter what and luckily, we have the tools to do so.
Embrace testing, focus on covering as many scenarios as you can and feel comfortable deploying. Even on Friday…</p>

            <!-- content --><p>In our Ampere Altra powered Wiwynn Mt. Jade server review, we are going to see why we feel this is the most significant new server of 2020.&nbsp;Wiwynn is far from a household name but it should not be unfamiliar to STH readers. STH got an exclusive tour in Q4 2018 of the company’s headquarters. You can read about that in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/where-cloud-servers-come-from-visiting-wiwynn-in-taipei/">Where Cloud Servers Come From Visiting Wiwynn in Taipei</a>. Although Wiwynn may not be called out in press releases such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/idc-3q20-server-tracker-dell-and-hpe-with-big-share-gain-lenovo-inspur-huawei/">IDC 3Q20 Server Tracker</a> it counts large cloud providers such as Facebook and Microsoft among its customers and has revenue of almost $6B USD per year the last time we checked. Compared to the traditional vendors IDC puts in their press releases, that would put them above Lenovo on hardware sales revenue, but with far fewer employees. Having the Wiwynn Mt. Jade server platform with the Arm-based Ampere Altra is a big deal. Wiwynn’s business model is not to sell low numbers of servers to customers.<span id="more-49470"></span></p>
<p>In this review, we are going to look at the platform, and discuss some of the great features and nuances. We are also going to discuss performance, and then we are going to discuss why this is one of the most important platforms to be released in 2020. Even if you are not interested in Arm servers, this review is going to have some insights that go well beyond just the Altra processor and the server itself.</p>
<h2>Video Version</h2>
<p>As with many of our new pieces, we are going to have a video version of this article as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Most Significant Server of 2020 Wiwynn Mt Jade Ampere Altra Arm Server" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jESiMLQVNf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a longer video, and has a lot of commentary around the server, and the market impact. As always, we suggest opening a new browser/ tab to watch it as it is a better experience than the embedded player. Also, likes and channel subscriptions are always welcome.</p>
<h2>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server Hardware Overview</h2>
<p>With our server reviews going into more detail, we now split our hardware overview into two primary sections. The first is that we look at the exterior of the server to get the basic bits that one servicing the server in a rack would most likely notice. We then get into the internal overview to look at some of the configurability and key features of the server.</p>
<h3>Ampere Altra Wiwynn Mt. Jade Server External Hardware Overview</h3>
<p>Taking a look at the Mt. Jade platform, we can see a fairly typical 2U server layout. This has a single USB port on the left, and a VGA port along with standard power button/ LEDs on the right. The main feature, by far, is storage. There are 24x 2.5″ bays and Wiwynn is leveraging the Ampere Altra platform to deliver one of the most forward-looking designs we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Wiwynn is connecting these 24x drive bays using 6x Amphenol PCIe Gen4 x16 cables. This is not a server designed for SAS/ SATA, instead, the company is leveraging the unique capabilities of the Ampere Altra platform to deliver something decidedly ahead of what many traditional vendors such as Dell, HPE, and Lenovo offer. Here the backplane does not have features such as a SAS expander. Instead, this is a NVMe backplane. One can see the backplanes are held in by thumbscrews, but the impact of Ampere Altra is felt immediately here, this is an all-NVMe design. This design provides Wiwynn the flexibility to swap to a SAS/SATA backplane setup if a customer wishes, but we really like this hardline stance to simplify on a next-generation architecture.</p>

<p>The chassis itself has four of those drive bays (one cable’s worth) that are optionally connected. Although the cable is connected via the backplane here, the other end can be used in a PCIe Gen4 x16 header that can instead provide PCIe connectivity to rear risers. Ampere Altra has many PCIe lanes, but there are limits. Still, Wiwynn’s forward-looking design is moving beyond the limitations of PCB and has configurability on where PCIe lanes are directed. We will see more of this type of design in the PCIe Gen4 era but it will become increasingly commonplace as we move to PCIe Gen5 and beyond. Effectively, with Ampere Altra is providing Wiwynn with a platform that is already incorporating these design principles.</p>
<p>On the rear of the server, we see a fairly standard layout. The rear I/O consists of a VGA port, a management LAN port, a serial port, and two USB 3 ports. There are three blocks for I/O risers, two are full-height and one is low-profile. One can also see an OCP NIC 3.0 slot in the middle of the platform.</p>

<p>The 2kW power supplies seem a bit large for the relatively lower power consumption of the Ampere Arm server chips. The 80Plus Platinum units are likely larger than a normal server of this class simply as this is also a development platform. As a result, people tend to plug a multitude of devices into this type of server. That can include many high-power NVMe SSDs up front, or even accelerators in the rear. We tried the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-t4-ai-inferencing-gpu-review/">NVIDIA T4</a> and it worked in this platform.</p>

<p>Part of the purpose of this piece is to show how similar the server is to a modern x86 server since that is a big question when organizations are looking to add Arm into their data centers.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to look at the internals of the server before proceeding with the remainder of our review.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>As a Cloud Engineer, automation has become a part of my daily life. Automatically deploying Infrastructure using Code has become a safe and fast way to provision servers in the Cloud. Initially, it takes more time to configure the infrastructure as code, but it's reusable and minimizes configuration errors by human mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could apply the same principle to our local development environment?</strong> This guide will show you how to automatically set up your Macbook or Linux machine using Ansible and dotfiles.</p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#prerequisite">Prerequisite</a></li>
<li><a href="#homebrew">Homebrew</a></li>
<li><a href="#ansible">Ansible</a></li>
<li><a href="#playbook">Playbook</a></li>
<li><a href="#setup-your-preferred-packages">Setup your preferred packages</a></li>
<li><a href="#configure-dotfiles">Configure dotfiles</a></li>
<li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li>
<li><a href="#installation-complete">Installation complete!</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>Ensure Apple's command-line tools are installed:</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>
<p>The first step is to download  <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>  for your Mac:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c <span>"<span>$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)</span>"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Homebrew allows you to easily install packages and applications on your machine without having to go to the download page of the vendor to install it from there. An added benefit is that you can easily update the packages using a simple command like:</p>
<pre><code>brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ansible">Ansible</h2>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/overview/how-ansible-works">Ansible</a>  is a tool that automates provisioning, does configuration management, and is being used widely in the Cloud.</p>
<p>It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.</p>
<p>So the next step is to install  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> using Homebrew:</p>
<pre><code>brew install python ansible
</code></pre>
<p>An important note when installing Python with Homebrew is that we need to change the PATH on our system for Python, otherwise MacOS will use the system default Python.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> PATH=<span>"/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:<span>$PATH</span>"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We want to avoid using the system default for  <a target="_blank" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/time-to-make-the-switch-9eb719d434de">many reasons</a>, but the most important one is that it still comes with Python2.7 (which is deprecated).</p>
<h2 id="playbook">Playbook</h2>
<p>Ansible is the orchestration tool and uses <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html">Playbooks</a> to record and execute Ansible’s configuration and deployment on the system.</p>
<p>Playbooks can be seen as an instruction manual at which the system is guided to execute the instructions that you have written. The benefit of using this is that you can apply the same set of instructions to different machines and expect the same outcome every time.</p>
<p>These Playbooks can be shared. So before we proceed with the installation, you need to clone or fork the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook">mac-dev-playbook repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setup-your-preferred-packages">Setup your preferred packages</h2>
<p>Every development environment is unique, so you can create a <code>config.yml</code> that contains a list of packages and configuration settings that you want to apply to your environment. As an example you can have a look at the <code>default.config.yml</code> in the root of the folder which contains a list of packages and configurations, as shown below:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This playbook is pretty versatile and allows you to install Homebrew, Mac Application Store (mas) packages, composer, gem, npm, and pip packages.</p>
<h2 id="configure-dotfiles">Configure dotfiles</h2>
<p>Once you've created your own config file with your preferred packages, it's time to add your own Dotfiles repository to setup custom configurations for your software.</p>
<p><strong>So what are dotfiles?</strong> Dotfiles are text-based configuration files that store settings of almost every application, or tool that runs in your environment. In communities like Github, people share their application preferences so others can use them to set up their systems faster by restoring these "dotfile" configuration files. The biggest advantage is that you can backup your application preferences and make sure you're always using the same preferences, irrespective of the machine that you're using.</p>
<p>If you're new to dotfiles you can read more about it in this <a target="_blank" href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">helpful guide on dotfiles</a>. I'll also share a few links below which contain pre-configured dotfiles for your favorite tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles">Mathias’s dotfiles</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it">Community bash framework</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alrra/dotfiles">Allra macOS / Ubuntu dotfiles</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles">Geerlingguy's dotfiles</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: dotfiles contain personal preferences, so it's good to review these files and apply changes where necessary before you copy them to your own repository</strong></p>
<p>Once you have your own repository filled with dotfiles, you can update the <code>dotfiles_repo</code> variable in the <code>config.yml</code> with your own dotfiles repository. Below I've shown an example of what it looks like when I set up my own dotfiles:</p>
<pre><code><span>configure_dotfiles:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>dotfiles_repo_accept_hostkey:</span> <span>false</span>
<span>dotfiles_repo_local_destination:</span> <span>~/Github/dotfiles</span>
<span>dotfiles_repo_version:</span> <span>master</span>
<span>dotfiles_repo:</span> <span>git@github.com:dsteenman/dotfiles.git</span>
<span>dotfiles_files:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.aliases.zsh</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.aws</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.eslintignore</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.eslintrc</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.fzf.zsh</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.gitconfig</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.gitconfig.user</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.gitignore</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.iterm2</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.macos</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.starship</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.zprofile</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.zsh_plugins.txt</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.zshenv</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>.zshrc</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The parameter <code>dotfiles_repo_local_destination</code> is the location where ansible downloads your dotfiles repository. Remember that location, because that's where you'll manage changes in your dotfiles. Ansible automatically creates symlinks of the dotfiles that you enabled in the parameter <code>dotfiles_files</code> and link them to your home folder on your Mac or Ubuntu machine. The advantage of this construction is that when you make adjustments in your dotfiles over time, it will automatically update the repository. You only have to commit and push the changes to update it remotely.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Once the requirements have been fulfilled, we can proceed with the actual installation and let Ansible perform it's magic!</p>
<p>In the root of the folder <code>mac-dev-playbook</code> repository that you forked or cloned run the command <code>ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml</code> to install the required ansible roles.</p>
<p>Now you can run the playbook and install your packages and dotfiles with the command <code>ansible-playbook main.yml -u [username] --ask-become-pass</code> (substitute <code>[username]</code> for your username). Enter your account password when prompted.</p>
<h2 id="installation-complete">Installation complete!</h2>
<p><strong>Your Macbook should be fully customized and ready for development!</strong> Having automated provisioning of your development machine is very useful if you use lots of different development tools, each with its own unique settings.</p>
<p>If you need to manage these tools then it's a must to keep track of any changes in preferences. By using this playbook solution we save our configurations in Github. That way we have a backup and we're able to reuse these settings irrespective of any machine we use.</p>
<p>Once you've setup your playbook, it takes approximately 30 minutes to install all the development packages and preferred configuration settings.</p>

<h3>
Why aren't the earliest sunset and latest sunrise on the same day as
the winter solstice?
</h3>

<p>The shortest day of the year is the day of the winter solstice, which in
2020 is December 20 or 21 depending on time zone. It seems reasonable that
the latest sunrise and earliest sunset would both occur on the shortest
day.&nbsp; But it's not so; the earliest sunset is a couple of weeks
earlier and the latest sunrise is a couple of weeks later.&nbsp; <a name="back1" href="#note1">[Note&nbsp;1]</a>&nbsp; (The notes contain
additional explanation that can be skipped on first reading.)

</p><p>What explains this peculiarity?&nbsp; Why don't the earliest sunset and
latest sunrise both fall on the shortest day?

</p><p>The time of day when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky is
called <em>solar noon</em>.&nbsp; The length of time from one solar noon to
the next is called the <em>solar day</em>.&nbsp; That is, one solar day is
the time it takes for the sun to return to its highest point in the sky.

</p><p>The length of the solar day varies during the year:&nbsp; Near
the winter and summer solstices the solar day is <em>more</em> than 24
hours long, and near the spring and fall equinoxes it's <em>less</em> than
24 hours long.&nbsp; (Why so?&nbsp;We'll see shortly.)&nbsp;
<!--
So solar noon
rarely occurs exactly at clock noon; it's sometimes before and sometimes
after.&nbsp;
-->
Therefore:&nbsp; <em>near the solstices, solar noon occurs at a slightly
later clock time each day</em> because the solar day is more than 24 hours
and the clock day is always exactly 24 hours.

</p><p>Next: Since solar noon is a little later each day, sunset is also a
little later each day.&nbsp; (This is true because
the time from solar noon to sunset doesn't change very much near the
winter solstice <a name="back2" href="#note2">[Note&nbsp;2]</a>.)&nbsp;
But if sunset is a little later each day, that means
the earliest sunset has already happened!&nbsp; By the same reasoning,
later solar noons at the solstice imply later sunrises, hence sunrise is getting later
and the latest sunrise is yet to occur.&nbsp; [Notes <a name="back3" href="#note3">3</a>, <a name="back4" href="#note4">4</a>]

</p><p>So now we see why a longer-than-average solar day causes both earliest
sunset and latest sunrise to <em>not</em> fall on the solstice. The next
step is to understand why the length of the solar day varies, and in
particular why it is longer at the solstices.

</p><p>There are two factors that change the length of the solar day.&nbsp; The
first is that the earth's axis is tilted with respect to its orbit around
the sun, and the second is that the earth's orbit is not a circle but an
ellipse.&nbsp; The first of these factors, called the <em>obliquity</em> of
the axis, has the larger effect and is the only one we examine
here <a name="back5" href="#note5">[Note&nbsp;5]</a>.&nbsp; So let's study
the length of the solar day assuming that the tilted earth orbits the sun in a
perfect circle.

</p><p>Here's a summary:&nbsp; The length of the solar day is determined mostly
by the rotation of the earth on its axis, but is also affected a little bit
by the revolution of the earth around the sun.&nbsp; The rotation by itself
would create a solar day of constant length whether the axis was tilted or
not.&nbsp; The slight change caused by the revolution would be a constant if
the earth were not tilted, but because of the tilt it is <em>not</em>
constant;&nbsp; this effect varies through the year and makes the
solar day longer near the solstices and shorter near the equinoxes.&nbsp;
Now for the details.&nbsp; [The explanation that follows is based on a
presentation by Andy Latto.]

</p><p>At any instant, there is exactly one point on the earth's surface where
the sun is directly overhead.&nbsp; To find it, draw a line from the center
of the sun to the center of the earth and stand on the point where the line
touches the earth's surface.&nbsp; At that point, and no other, the sun is
exactly overhead.&nbsp; It is solar noon at that point and also everywhere
else at the same longitude.

</p><p>If the earth were motionless with respect to the sun, the
sun-directly-overhead point would always be in the same spot. But the point
moves, both because of the rotation of the earth on its axis and because of
the revolution of the earth around the sun.&nbsp; When the point moves once
around the earth, one solar day has passed.&nbsp;When we say "once
around the earth" we care only about the <em>east-west</em> motion of
the point—solar noon recurs when the point traverses 360 degrees of
longitude.&nbsp; The <em>north-south</em> motion of the point doesn't
matter to us since it doesn't count in determining whether solar noon has arrived.

</p><p>First let's examine the effect of the earth's rotation.&nbsp; Imagine an
untilted earth not revolving around the sun, just rotating, and it's
obvious that the sun-directly-overhead point moves along the equator, once
around per day.&nbsp; Now mentally tilt the earth's axis
and you'll see that the point follows
some other parallel of latitude, still once around per
day.&nbsp; <a name="back6" href="#note6">[Note 6]</a>&nbsp; Since the point
moves along a parallel of latitude, it moves in a purely east-west
direction, in fact due west.&nbsp; If we measure speed in degrees of
longitude per hour (not in miles per hour!) we realize that the speed of
the point is constant, no matter what latitude it's at; it goes once
around, 360 degrees, each day.

</p><p>The bottom line is that the rotation of the earth causes the
sun-directly-overhead point to move directly west, crossing lines of
longitude at a constant rate.&nbsp; If this were the only factor to
consider, the length of the solar day would be constant regardless of any
tilt.

</p><p>Now we have to add the effect of the earth's revolution around the
sun.&nbsp; Again, start by imagining the earth with untilted axis, this
time not rotating but just revolving around the sun.&nbsp; You'll see the
sun-directly-overhead point moving once around the earth each year.&nbsp;
And (take my word for this) the point moves eastward, so its motion is
<em>contrary</em> to the motion from the rotation—when added in, this
motion makes each solar day a little <em>longer</em> than it would be from
the rotation alone.&nbsp; (But just a very little, since the motion from
the revolution is so much slower.)&nbsp; If the earth were not tilted, the
motion due to revolution would be due east at constant rate, and would
lengthen each day equally throughout the year.

</p><p>But the earth <em>is</em> tilted!&nbsp; So the earth's revolution around
the sun doesn't move the sun-directly-overhead point along the equator, but
rather around a great circle that's tilted with respect to the
equator.&nbsp; Here's the path that the sun-directly-overhead point would
follow if only revolution around the sun was a factor (and also the
constant-latitude path that the sun-directly-overhead point would follow if
we only take into account the earth's rotation): <img src="http://larry.denenberg.com/sdo-point.jpg" alt="Path of the SDO point">

</p><p>Now the crux of the matter: As the sun-directly-overhead point moves
around this great-circle path, it is <em>not</em> moving directly
east.&nbsp; It moves generally east, but sometimes it's travelling a little
northeast and sometimes a little southeast.&nbsp; It moves due east only at
its most northerly and southerly extent, which happens at the solstices.

</p><p>So even though the overall speed of the point is constant,
the <em>eastward component</em> of the speed is not constant, and that's
what we care about:&nbsp; it's fastest when the point is moving due east
(at the solstices), and is smaller when the point is moving north or south
as well as east.&nbsp; The eastward speed is slowest when the point has the
largest northerly or southerly motion, that is, at the equinoxes, when the
point crosses the equator.&nbsp; <a name="back7" href="#note7">[Note&nbsp;7]</a>

</p><p>Hence this once-around-per-year motion of the point, which makes each
day a little longer, has a different effect at different times of the
year.&nbsp; At the solstices the motion is due east, so its eastward motion
is fastest and lengthens the solar day more.&nbsp; That is, at the
solstices, the solar day is longer than its average length.&nbsp; At the
equinoxes, the point is moving northeast or southeast as much as it ever
does, so the eastward component of its speed is at its slowest and has the
least effect at making the day longer.&nbsp; That is, at the equinoxes, the
solar day is a little shorter than average.&nbsp; And we're done.

</p><p>One last comment:&nbsp; If you take a picture of the sun each day when
your clock says noon (<em>not</em> at local solar noon) the sun is not
always in the same place in the sky.&nbsp; It moves east and west because
of the variation in the length of the solar day, and it moves north and
south with the change of the seasons.&nbsp; The combination of these
motions traces out a figure-eight shape called
the <a href="http://www.analemma.com/"><em>analemma</em></a> which you can
see pictured on some globes.

</p><h3><a name="notes">Notes:</a></h3>

<p><a name="note1">[1]</a> The actual dates of earliest sunset and latest
sunrise depend on latitude—near the equator, the earliest sunset occurs
in November!&nbsp; Solstices and equinoxes happen at the same instant
worldwide.&nbsp; <a href="#back1"><small>back</small></a>

</p><p><a name="note2"></a> 
[2] You might object to this:&nbsp; "The time
between solar noon and sunset isn't constant!" I hear you cry.&nbsp;
"It gets shorter in December and longer in July, making more or less
daylight!"&nbsp; Yes it does, but that change happens <em>very</em>
slowly near the solstices and can be ignored.

</p><p>Think of it this way:&nbsp; There are two factors that change the time
of sunset.&nbsp; The first is the change in the number of hours of
daylight—we get fewer hours of daylight as we move towards December,
which is reflected in earlier sunsets.&nbsp; The second factor is the
difference between solar time and clock time, which we're explaining in
this website (see Note&nbsp;4).&nbsp; The first factor is the dominating factor
through most of the year.&nbsp; Near the summer and winter solstices,
though, the amount of daylight in the day is essentially constant, changing
only a tiny amount from day to day, and the second factor comes into
play.&nbsp; <a href="#back2"><small>back</small></a>

</p><p><a name="note3">[3]</a> We can apply the same reasoning to the summer
solstice to conclude that the <em>latest</em> sunset must <em>follow</em>
the summer solstice, and the <em>earliest</em> sunrise
must <em>precede</em> the summer solstice.&nbsp; Just remember that
<em>at either solstice, both sunrise and sunset are getting later</em> and
you can always tell where the earliest/latest sunrise/sunset occur.
&nbsp; <a href="#back3"><small>back</small></a>

</p><p><a name="note4">[4]</a> Here's another way to look at it:&nbsp; We don't
tell time using the solar day, because we want all days to have exactly the
same length.&nbsp; So we use clocks that run at a constant rate independent
of the sun, ticking off exactly 24&nbsp;hours each day.&nbsp; These clocks
average out the variations in the solar day, making all days the same</p></div>

    <p>Interactive Breadth First Search in a Grid</p>
    <p>
        2020 December 20
    </p>
</div><div>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth first search(BFS)</a> is a very powerful and useful algorithm for
exploring graph like structures. A BFS searches it’s nearest neighbors first
before moving on. It’s main use is to find a path using
the fewest hops. Here we use it to explore a grid that can be modified
by a user. In this grid, we have verticies (the grid boxes), and edges 
(the box north, south, east and west).</p>

<p>A plain english example would be as</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a queue with your starting element.</li>
  <li>while the queue is not empty
    <ol>
      <li>shift out the first element.</li>
      <li>does that element meet the goal?
        <ol>
          <li>If so quit with success</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise for all neighbors of that element add them to the queue 
if they haven’t been seen yet. Make a note of where we came from.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise fail.</li>
</ol>


<ol>
  <li>Change your grid size of anything between 4 and 40 elements wide. 
Hit the reset grid button.</li>
  <li>Set your start point using the “place start point” button. There must 
be exactly one starting point.</li>
  <li>Place some finish points using the “place finish point” button. There 
can be many finish points. In a regular BFS these are your target 
points.</li>
  <li>Add some constraints by drawing some walls.</li>
  <li>Hit either “Run” or “Step” to start the BFS
    <ol>
      <li>The active node will be surounded with a <span>gold</span> border.</li>
      <li>Discovered nodes are surrounded with a <span>dark blue</span> border.</li>
      <li>The nodes in the queue are surrounded with a <span>light blue</span> border.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>After the goal is found it will draw the path back to the starting node. It will be shown in
 <span>light green</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/21/a-to-do-app-that-fits-in-a-single-tweet/">post</a> was an awesome one, I learned a lot in JavaScript and and I was happy to see people doing what I thought impossible. Writing a simple todo app within 280 chars, in plain js.</p>
<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login. </strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a company, you need to push to gain as much users as possible on their mobile devices, that’s the best way to track, to send notifications and keep you hooked and keep coming back. If I had a company like Reddit I might have done the same.</p>
<p>But for blocking users from their mobile devices, a service they once offered is a very dark pattern, instead what they should do is introduce some awesome features that will make the users download the app by themselves so they can enjoy those features. Not forcing the app though their throats.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced a similar experience on Reddit mobile?</p>
<p><em>Only after writing the and checking the screenshot again made me see that they allow you to see the subreddit by logging in. But that is obscured and they intend to push users to download the app.</em></p>

If not, then you might still be a junior who's transitioning into becoming an intermediate developer.</p><h3>Intermediate developer</h3><p>An intermediate developer is a competent team member and contributor.</p><p>The telling sign I use for this stage is that <b>intermediate developers usually have a mental urge or "pull" to believe that they know everything they need to know.</b></p><p>Perhaps they feel like their views on how to best architect a system are "complete."</p><p>Perhaps they feel like Javascript is the only programming language they ever need and ever want.</p><p>Whatever it is, there is some degree of feeling like they've "found" the silver bullet or that their current view is finally "the one."</p><blockquote><p><b>The intermediate stage is like stepping into puberty for your career.</b></p></blockquote><p>For example, teens tend to begin believing that they know better than their parents.</p><p>They tend to experiment and be bold about what they believe.</p><p>They begin to tread a path of their own.</p><p>This is the intermediate developer. They are starting to think for themselves.</p><h3>Senior developer</h3><p>The senior developer is becoming very skilled and knowledgeable to the point that those around them are looking to them as a mentor and a "go-to".</p><p>They usually have some specialised or advanced programming knowledge and can build more complex systems using advanced techniques and patterns.</p><p>Seniors are confident in what they know due to their experiences. But they also have a grasp on the fact that there's <i>so much they don't know about.</i></p><p>The biggest telling sign that you are in this stage is whether or not your peers are constantly coming to you for advice and guidance. Are you mentoring others too? These are all signs of being a senior developer.</p><h3>Lead developer</h3><p>The lead developer is focused on providing high-level guidance to their dev team.</p><p>But more importantly, they are a bridge or connector between the development team and the other business-oriented departments in your organisation.</p><p>Are you leading a team of developers? Do you also have to communicate with non-technical managers or other departments about what the development team is working on, etc? If so, you're a lead developer.</p><h3>Tech Leader</h3><p>I hesitate to include this one, but I think it's helpful to see where your career could go in the future.</p><p>A tech leader has made a name for themselves as an expert in some specific area(s) and usually have a very targeted branding/positioning as to what they do well.</p><p>That might be a specific programming language, web security, front-end development with react, a developer mentor, or even a particular industry.</p><p>They could be community builders who have a following of people that look up to them as a direct or indirect mentor.</p><p>They could be thought leaders who champion some specific cause or idea.</p><p>They usually speak publicly about their area of expertise or the ideas that they champion.</p><p>In a nutshell, they are technology experts and very skilled communicators.</p><p>If that sounds like you, then you might be a tech leader.</p><h2 id="How to get to the next stage">How to get to the next stage</h2><p>I've written elsewhere about specific tips to move between each career step. For the moment, I want to highlight some more general pieces of advice that anyone can leverage and use to move forward.</p><h3>Stand-out</h3><p>You need to stand-out within your company if you want to land promotions and be a part of important and growth-inducing projects.</p><p><b>Find a gap within your team or company that could help solve some important problems your company is facing.</b></p><p>Practically speaking, if you are early in your career, just keep an eye out for whenever your peers seem surprised at some skill or way of doing things you have. This might indicate a gap that could be helpful to your organisation!</p><figure><img alt="Tulip standing out" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/cjwb7umaxoxv/21BebbVbTAiiI20dza4oac/a4a8fcfd76d42b38da278dc8a9f8449d/rupert-britton-l37N7a1lL6w-unsplash.jpg"><figcaption>Photo by Rupert Britton on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>For example, if you did something fancy with CSS that other developers notice and are impressed with, then that could indicate a gap.</p><p>For more seasoned developers, it should be more apparent what gaps need to be filled. And, the more experienced you are, the more you should naturally drift into a position of mentoring others and having a clear picture of what gaps need to be filled.</p><p>Once you are seasoned, you can use this principle and apply it to the global community - not just your internal company. Try to figure out where there is a need or where certain trends seem to be pointing.</p><p>The specific gap you fill doesn't matter so much.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607775961422/elXIChWIZ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into Horcruxing, here's a quick prologue on online security hygiene. You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

The GAFES<em> </em>were formed in 1986 as an elite quick reaction force specializing in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare. When the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, the GAFES received combat experience in the brutal fight with the leftist <em>EjÃ©rcito Zapatista de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional</em> (EZLN) in Chiapas. According to <a href="http://historic.edualter.org/material/ddhh/proc1.htm">reporting by Carlos Marin</a>, the army sent the GAFES to Chiapas to <strong>create paramilitaries and displace the population</strong> in order to break the support of the people for the EZLN, an approach which would be used against organized crime years later. In Ioan Grillo's book <em>El Narco</em>, he describes how the mutilated bodies of rebels captured by the GAFES were dumped along a riverbank in the Las Margaritas municipality with their ears and noses sliced off, the sort of spectacular violence that <em>Los Zetas</em> would later standardize in the Drug War.</p><figure><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-26-at-5.09.07-PM-1.png"><figcaption>2005 FBI memo about <em>Los Zetas</em></figcaption></figure><p>Some of the original members of <em>Los Zetas</em> are said to have been <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB499/DOCUMENT01-20050422.PDF">trained by the U.S.</a> at the notorious School of the Americas, although accounts vary about exactly who, where and when.

According to Lt. Col. Craig Deare (retired), the former Academic Dean at the intellectual center of gravity of U.S. defense policy in Latin America since 1997, the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), it was likely that more than 500 Mexican GAFES received training from U.S. special operations forces (SOF).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2010/11/03/us-trained-cartel-terrorises-mexico/">reporting</a> in Al Jazeera:</p><p><em>Some of the cartelâ€™s initial members were elite Mexican troops, trained in the early 1990s by Americaâ€™s 7th Special Forces Group or â€œsnake eatersâ€� at Ft.

During the Reagan administration in the 1980s, the 7th SFG trained, supported and fought with some of the most brutal and repressive special operations and unconventional forces in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela.</p><figure><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-2.45.27-PM.png"><figcaption>A U.S. special forces Soldier assigned to 7th SF Group, oversees a group of Guatemalan Special Forces "Kaibils" conduct pistol marksmanship training Jan. 28 in Poptun, Guatemala (<a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/1749645/kaibil-us-special-forces-promote-security-through-partnership">DVIDS</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Between 1996 and 1999, <a href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/1998/08/16/mexico.html">3,200 soldiers</a>, including at least 500 GAFES, were reportedly trained by the 7th SFG in the U.S. to create elite "counternarcotics" forces for fighting on behalf of the post-Cold War U.S. national security agenda.</p><p>Conveniently framed as an ironic consequence of the corrupting influence of the cartels, the training from the U.S. special forces diffused into the service of one of Mexico's oldest drug trafficking organizations. In 1997, the same year that the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies was founded, Arturo GuzmÃ¡n Decena, a GAFE later known by the alias "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Guzm%C3%A1n_Decena">El Zeta-uno</a>", supposedly defected along with other elite Mexican soldiers to work for the Gulf cartel in Tamaulipas.

The Kaibiles and other Guatemalan security forces were trained by the U.S. in counterinsurgency and unconventional warfare before, during and after Guatemala's 36-year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/guatemalan-army-waged-genocide-new-report-finds.html">genocide</a>.

According to <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Bay-Area-protesters-sentenced-in-Georgia-Jail-2796779.php">testimony</a> from Major Joseph Blair, a former instructor at the school, the changes were only superficial and an identical curriculum was taught from the exact same instruction manuals. Between 1999 and 2010, <a href="http://www.ghrc-usa.org/Publications/factsheet_kaibiles.pdf">3,555 Guatemalan soldiers</a>, many of them Kaibiles, were trained by the U.S. through WHINSEC and other programs.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-2.58.27-PM.png" width="1256" height="712"></p><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-10.11.53-AM.png" width="1462" height="944"></p><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-21-at-10.11.36-AM.png" width="1462" height="944"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/world/guatemalan-army-waged-genocide-new-report-finds.html">New York Times</a>; <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/s3fs-public/mos_en.pdf">CEH</a>;</figcaption></figure><p>The Kaibiles are taught to kill without mercy or thought.

Adults were interrogated and tortured, one by one, and the women were raped by the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles also cut fetuses out of pregnant women. After the interrogation, the adults were also killed with a hammer and the corpses were dumped in a well. A few years after the massacre, one of the Kaibil officers who had supervised the atrocity, Pedro Pimental Rios, became an instructor at the School of the Americas.

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

      I've included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure.
      I've tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they'll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see
      a few oddities. That's part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines.
      The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter

                <h3 id="a-journey">A journey</h3>
<p>After spending some time in TypeScript you may begin to crave type safety everywhere in your life. JavaScript is an inherently unsafe language and there are dragons to be found everywhere and in almost every framework. Most frameworks are sufficiently covered, but what if you design a beautiful API internally that needs to be incredibly feature rich, and incredibly safe, but still allow for the best JavaScript idioms. Well at that point you may have to dive into writing some pretty gnarly types.</p>
<p>In general there are a number of TypeScript TYPE libraries out there, <a href="https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt">ts-toolbelt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types">utility-types</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-fest">type-fest</a> to name a few. These libraries are great, and contain a plethora of information, but they are generally sparse in describing HOW they created their utility types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of great type libraries, but no great documentation on how they’re built</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of this post is to not only expose some great utility types, but also some tips and tricks that I realized along the way. Unfortunately this post requires a relatively strong understanding of TypeScript types and tricks. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html">Advanced Types</a> is a great place to start before diving in!</p>
<h3 id="esoteric-solutions">Esoteric solutions</h3>
<p>A lot of these solutions (and problems) may feel esoteric, and that’s because frankly they are. They are not for the faint of heart, they do not need to be known for daily TypeScript use. They are the nitty-gritty realities of writing type libraries for incredibly complex or il-defined JavaScript problems.</p>
<p>Most of these types come from a few TypeScript libraries im working on, namely <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-schema">safe-schema</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-safe">mongo-safe</a>, both of which I intend to do lengthy blog posts on in the future.</p>
<p>I have tried to organize these with an example of the usage, and the reason why the problem or solution is novel or interesting. They are in no particular order.</p>

<h3 id="reason">Reason</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will need to use the same type over and over in your type definition. Every time TypeScript encounters your type it will have to evaluate it again. Using the infer trick you can store a variable in your type that you can use throughout the rest of it.</p>
<p>You will see this <code>extends infer</code> trick pop up in a few places. <code>infer</code> has some interesting properties that make it useful when defining complex types.</p>
<p>Note the use of <code>Impossible</code> here. We can never reach the Impossible branch, so typically we would specify never here, but I have found just putting never there will be confusing in the future when looking at these types again thinking that never branch could possibly be hit. The use of explicit type alias’s that resolve to basic types is a great way to be explicit in your definitions.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This will not work if the result of your type is <code>never</code>. If T or <code>Fancy&lt;Shmancy&lt;Deeply&lt;Nested&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is never, the whole expression will result in <code>never</code>.</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-1">Reason</h3>
<p>It is not easy to test for <code>never</code>. Once one of the types in your expression is <code>never</code> it will <strong>poison</strong> the rest of the expression to evaluate to <code>never</code>. Typically, this is a useful feature, but when you actually need to check for <code>never</code> you can wrap your expression in a tuple. This will trick the TypeScript compiler to compare apples to apples instead of expanding the <code>never</code>.</p>
<p>It works by comparing the tuple <code>T</code> to the tuple <code>never</code>. We use this tuple trick in a number of places. I am not certain as to why it works, other than the fact that tuples make TypeScript slightly less greedy in its evaluation.</p>

<p>You will often need to deeply check a few things, and only execute some logic if all are a certain value. This can result in an annoying deeply nested structure.</p>
<p>One clean solution to this is to check all of them upfront in a tuple and compare that to the expected results of each. Now your tree is only one level deep and your intent is much clearer!</p>

</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-3">Reason</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will pass a union so deeply that when it reaches its final destination the union has been distributed. This <em>can</em> result in unintended behavior as described above. Since the union has been distributed, <code>value</code> in the first example will result in the type</p>
<pre><code>{thing:
    {[key in 'a']:boolean} | 
    {[key in 'b']:boolean} | 
    {[key in 'c']:boolean}
}
</code></pre><p>when your goal was simply <code>{thing: {[key in ('a'|'b'|'c')]:boolean} }</code>.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to wrap <code>T</code> in a tuple to force TypeScript to not distribute your union in subsequent expressions.</p>

<span>const</span> value: <span>Bad</span> <span>=</span> {shoes:<span>1</span>, other:<span>true</span>};  <span>// throws an error on shoes but intellisense and type is misleading

<span>const</span> value: <span>ExcludeNever</span>&lt;<span>Bad</span>&gt; <span>=</span> {shoes: <span>1</span>, other: <span>true</span>} <span>// throws a full error and no intellisense
</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-4">Reason</h3>
<p>Occasionally you will process some type in a <code>Record</code> and set a value to never. This is perfectly valid and will throw errors when the user attempts to put a value there.</p>
<p>The problem is, intellisense does not exclude this key from your result list. Sure the type is <code>never</code>, but since the key still exists it will allow you to put a value there.</p>
<p>The solution is to use the new TypeScript <code>as</code> syntax to set the key to <code>never</code> when appropriate, that way it will not be available to the user.</p>
<p>Note: the end result is the same, you cannot put a value for shoes, but the DX is significantly improved in the second case.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="reason-5">Reason</h3>
<p>Now this one is a bit hard to explain, but easily one of the most powerful tricks in this post. It has saved my bacon too many times to count.</p>
<p>The example above is intentionally sparse since it’s hard to find real world examples. <em>When you need it, you’ll know</em>.</p>
<p>Along your journey to making a complex library completely typesafe you will inevitably create a type that is <em>potentially</em> infinitely deeply nested.</p>
<p>A little background: TypeScript has a rule that it will generally not dive deeper than about 50 levels of type checking before it throws up its hands and resolves the dreaded “type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite”. This means your type is too complex and it would take too long to evaluate, so it wont.</p>
<p>I will say that 90% of the time this is due to an issue in your code that is solvable without use of trickery. Typically, you screwed up somewhere. However, on the rare occasion where you did everything right, your type is properly optimized, but your library requirements actually do push the envelope, you can use the above trick.</p>
<p>How it works is still a bit of a mystery to me. This is a trick I learned from the incredible library <a href="https://github.com/millsp/ts-toolbelt">ts-toolbelt</a>. The best I can tell is it <strong>defers</strong> the evaluation of the type T until it is actually requested. What this means is just because your type <strong>can</strong> be nested infinitely, this outcome will be tested <strong>based on usage</strong> rather than a blanket statement.</p>
<p>That means if you pass a T that does exhaust the 50 cap then TypeScript will be sure to let you know, but until then all of the T’s that play nice will continue to work.</p>
<p>I dont know if the explanation above is correct and would love to be corrected! In my experience and research this is how it works.</p>

December 21, 2020 | https://www.softinio.com/post/unicomp-new-model-m-keyboard/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.softinio.com/post/unicomp-new-model-m-keyboard/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_new_model_m.png"><p>Unicomp new Model M keyboard is the latest version of the classic and fabulous IBM Model M keyboard that came out earlier this year. This blog post is my unboxing and review of this timeless keyboard.</p><p>My favorite keyboard of all time was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M keyboard</a>. Through out the 1980s and the 1990s I would exclusively use this keyboard. In fact as I type this blog post I can confirm I still have 3 of them in my garage back in London, England.</p><p>Ever since I moved to the USA, both at work and at home I have been using various keyboards by Apple. Though I have nothing bad to say about the Apple keyboards, after all they are cosmetically pleasing, of high build quality and work really well with all things Apple, I started really missing my IBM Model M. This is when I found out Unicomp have released a new Model M and I decided to buy one.</p><h2 id="who-are-unicomp">Who are Unicomp?</h2><p>When IBM decided to stop manufacturing keyboards, a company called Lexmark bought their equipment and all rights to their keyboards and continued making them. In turn Lexmark stopped manufacturing keyboards too and at that point some ex-IBM and ex-Lexmark staff got together, purchased all the manufacturing equipment and rights to continue manufacturing the keyboards (but of course without the IBM and Lexmark branding) and setup a new company called <code>Unicomp</code>. <a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/">Unicomp</a> has since continued producing these keyboards for like the last 25 years.</p><h2 id="unboxing">Unboxing</h2><p>This is how it was delivered:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M box"></p><p>When the package arrived I could feel the keyboard moving inside the box, but when I opened the box I saw how well it was packed:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_open_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M opened box"></p><p>I took it out of its box and removed all packaging material it was wrapped in:</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_out_of_box.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M Keyboard"></p><h2 id="review">Review</h2><p>As I looked at the keyboard, before taking it out of the box, I could immediately tell it was a Model M and its evolution. Super excited and impatient I took it out of the box. My first observation was that it comes with a USB (standard not USB-C) cable that is not removable. It felt lighter in weight than the original IBM Model M I had. Next I looked at its build quality and was overall impressed. The original IBM Model M does feel more robust but I could not fault this new Model M. All this was to be expected though, as I didn’t have my expectation set to receiving a keyboard that is made by 100% the same materials as the original Model M I had.</p><p>Having one of the newer macbooks with only USB-C ports, I set my new keyboard on my desk and plugged it in via a USB adapter and off I went looking for excuses to type so I can use my new keyboard.</p><p>I am thoroughly enjoying using this keyboard. Its typing feel and size are on par with the original Model M I had. I had forgotten how much more comfortable it is to type on Model M than an Apple keyboard. Comparing now, I can see that my hands are too big for the Apple keyboards so I would try to type in a cramped space to fit my hands in, as opposed to this Model M which is perfect for my hand size. This alone has resulted in me being able type faster, be more comfortable and make virtually no typing mistakes. As always I find the higher actuation point feel and the audible feedback the sound provided by the buckling springs with each keystroke incredibly pleasing. Comparing the sound of the buckling springs with the original IBM Model M, I would say the new Unicomp Model M is slightly quieter.</p><h3 id="how-well-does-it-work-with-macos">How well does it work with macOS</h3><p>When I went to place my order on Unicomp website they only had a windows version of the new Model M listed. Whilst that will work fine with macOS, it does have some features missing compared to a keyboard that has dedicated support for macOS, such as volume control, music play/stop/previous track /next track keys. Good news is I called Unicomp and spoke to Troy about this and he was kind enought to tell me I can place an order and request a custom configuration at a small fee to have the extra macOS features added. I did that and my keyboard has all the extra macOS keys functioning as expected. It even has the window key replaced with the macOS command key.</p><p><img src="https://www.softinio.com/img/unicomp_model_m_mac_keys.png" alt="Unicomp New Model M with macOS layout"></p><h3 id="unicomp-quality-of-service">Unicomp quality of service</h3><p>When you first visit Unicomp website, you get the sense that you just visited a website from 20 years ago with not the best user experience browsing or ordering. When you research Unicomp on the internet you won’t find much activity on social media or any form of marketing.</p><p>Please do not be put off by this and don’t judge them because of their dated look. The quality of service I received is one of the best I have ever received. When I called to find out more about the New Model M not only was the help I received exemplarity, but once I placed my order, even though it had the custom configuration of macOS support added was shipped within 24 hours of placing the order and the item received is fantastic in every possible way.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I am back again reunited with my old friend a Model M. I am enjoying using it so much after a gap of not having one that I am looking for excuses to use it more and more. So expect more <a href="https://www.softinio.com/">blogs</a> and <a href="https://softinio.substack.com/">newsletters</a> from me going forward, as this keyboard is a joy to use.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/NEW_M">Link to Unicomp Model M that I ordered</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>With Anjuna Enterprise Enclaves, data is secure by default. Anjuna builds on the enclave-enabling technology in Nitro Enclaves to extend data protection beyond memory and protection to storage and networks.</p>
<p>Anjuna’s “lift and shift” approach eliminates the need to work with ever-changing applications and software development kits (SDKs). And no changes to applications, recompilation, or operations are required.</p></span></p>

<p>Should web maps be centralized services?</p>

<p>
How many web applications or mobile apps do you use that have a map component? Rideshare apps display the location of drivers and passengers; ratings sites show the locations of restaurants; Craigslist and Wikipedia show contextual location for classifieds or encyclopedia articles. High quality, interactive maps are pervasive and simply fade into the background for end users.
</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a surge of new mapping applications. Beyond websites that <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">visualize the case count in different regions</a>, maps have become <b>critical computing infrastructure</b> for delivering health services.
</p>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps as Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>The New York City government uses Google Maps to help residents find a COVID-19 testing location near them.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/NYCCovidSites.png">
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Maps and Citizen Tech</h5>
        <p>The Taiwan government rationed face masks at pharmacies and published inventories via a public API; this enabled citizen developers, in combination with geocoding services and third-party basemaps, to create a variety of web and smartphone applications.</p>
        
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/Pharmacies.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<p>
For a developer who wants to integrate a map into their application, the choices are almost always to use a <b>hosted, centralized map service</b>; developer map mindshare is dominated by multinational companies. Some hosted map examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The embeddable native maps on Google's Android or Apple's iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS operating systems</li>
    <li>Google's commercial web map offering (Google Maps JavaScript API)</li>
    <li>Microsoft's recent release of Azure Maps and Amazon's AWS Location Service</li>
    <li>Commercial map GIS companies such as ESRI, MapQuest, CloudMade, HERE and Mapbox; free hosted maps like <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap Carto</a> or <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/">maps by Stamen Design</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>What is a basemap?</h4>

<p>Typical parts of a map application include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Translation from search tokens or addresses to locations (geocoding)</li>
    <li>Determining the place name or administrative division of a location (reverse geocoding)</li>
    <li>Finding directions between two locations (routing)</li>
    <li>Overlaying of domain-specific geographic features, such as COVID-19 testing sites</li>
    <li><b>Showing physical and cultural context</b> on maps, such as city names, nearby points of interest, and roads</li> 
</ul>

<p>It's this last component that we usually call a <b>basemap</b> - especially if it <b>displays map labels</b>, and is zoomable or <b>multi-resolution, implying the application of <i>cartographic generalization</i></b>.


</p><div>
    <div>
        <h5>Map Labels</h5>
        <p>A basemap is most useful for context if it displays map labels. Labels may be in a single language, but might display more than one language, alternate names, or transcriptions: for example, Romaji labels on maps of Japan.</p>
         
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/LabelScript.jpg">
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Generalization - More Art than Science</h5>
        <p>When the map scale is decreased - in this case by a factor of 2 - less relevant geographic features can be removed from the map. The ideal generalization <b>keeps the visual density of the map constant as scale is decreased</b>, even though the number of geographic features existing within those bounds increases exponentially.</p>
         
    </div>
    <p><img src="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/Generalize.jpg">
    </p>
</div>
<p>
Single-scale wayfinding maps you see in the real world are labeled and generalized by cartographers; multi-scale basemap services accomplish this in an <b>automated way</b>. The sophistication of computer programs to do this - especially at whole earth scale - can be grossly underestimated, even by experienced programmers. Good labeling and generalization are taken for granted, like good font rendering and typesetting - invisible when successful, glaringly flawed when unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>This also illustrates the key difference between a basemap and a dataset of geographic features, such as <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. <b>OSM is not a cartographic product; it does not attempt any generalization or ranking of features. </b> <a href="http://naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is an example of a cartographic product - it include fields such as <code>scalerank</code> to assist in generalization, curated by human editors.
</p>
<p>
<b>In theory, basemaps are fungible</b> - the cartographic context required is similar among diverse applications. So why do developers - and as a consequence, the World Wide Web - gravitate towards a small handful of hosted map platforms?

<h4>Mapmakers: Victims of Lofty Expectations</h4>

<p>
    The basemap status quo is defined by the cutting edge commercial product, and right now that's Google Maps. <b>Users are accustomed to, and will demand, a seamless abstraction of the physical world.</b> Map panning and zooming should be instantaneous, so designers of a high performance cartographic system must take into account:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The completeness and quantity of the underlying geodata</li>
    <li>The arrangement and indexing of geodata to achieve low latency</li>
    <li>Tile schemes and partitioning for generalized data</li>
    <li>Protocols for fetching and caching those tiles over the network</li>
    <li>Choice of a rasterization API like Cairo or OpenGL and the flow of vertex data to them</li> 
</ul>
<p>
The desired end product is a videogame-like, sixty-frames-per-second experience, and map systems often make the same technical compromises as games: for example, a map system that smoothly resizes labels in real time may choose to precompute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function#Applications">signed distance fields</a> for text glyphs on the server and fetch them by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">codepoint ranges</a>. This works beautifully for languages that use at most a few hundred Latin characters, but navigating to places that use Han characters such as China or Japan will degrade performance. Thus a cartographic system demands holistic design around tradeoffs such as latency or localization capabilities.

        <h5>Not Good Enough Anymore</h5>
        <p>Mapquest in the early 2000s required the user to click arrow buttons to pan and zoom; maps in 2020 are expected to respond instantly to mouse wheel scroll and finger pinch gestures.</p>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Serving Maps: best left to BigCorps?</h4>
<p>
    Given the demanding technical requirements above, it's easy to be led into thinking <b>maps are too hard for individual developers to solve and should be outsourced to a third-party hosted service.</b> A cartographic system is very "full-stack" in nature, but the commoditization of some potential components, like PostGIS or HTTP accelerators, makes the overall task less daunting. Bigness isn't really a constraint; the OpenStreetMap dataset as XML is <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">about 100 gigabytes</a>. Let's estimate 10x expansion to make a cartographic product; that's still only a terabyte of data to put on a disk somewhere.
</p>
<p>
<b>Developers believe something is too hard, until it isn't.</b> Issuing of SSL Certs was in practice limited to a few Certificate Authorities until Let's Encrypt; Hosting of seekable video content was only done by big sites in concert with CDNs, but now we have the standardized, hardware-accelerated HTML <code>video</code> element and ubiquitous broadband. Email is a notable counterexample; you've been able to run your own Mail Transfer Agent since the beginning, but the Hobbesian underworld of spam and phishing drives users into the oligopoly of a few providers.
</p>

<p>Serving maps is hard but not insurmountable; I'll suggest a factor limiting the landscape of web maps is not data bigness or the speed of slinging geodata down tubes, but licensing and realities of the market.</p>

<h4 id="cartography-commodity">Intellectual Property, Fine Print</h4>
<p>Firstly, mapmaking businesses rightly assert copyright over their cartography. This far predates webmaps: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street">Trap Streets</a> are a longstanding practice on print maps. This is often true even if the map is built from open data such as OSM - the derivation of a cartographic product, and quality of output, is "secret sauce" to achieve product differentiation.
</p>
<p><b>Secondly, map serving easily admits a Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) business model.</b> Shrink-wrapped software, or creating a piece of software and "selling it in a box", has been out of vogue for decades, possibly over piracy concerns, or because it has less extractive potential on enterprise budgets. 
In addition to copyright, <b>Terms of Service for hosted maps often prohibit combination with other geographic services, exclude specific use cases, or forbid caching.</b> These contracts work against developers by inventing scarcity: even if you need a small subset of map tiles, they must be fetched and billed; don't scrape the data and put it in version control.</p>
<p>
<b>The freemium, ToS-constrained nature of hosted map services disincentivizes innovation.</b> Inability to swap out the Google Maps frontend means interesting problems like labeling and generalization can't be attacked with piecemeal incrementalism. This tips developer's scales toward <i>Buy</i> rather than <i>Build</i>, especially when the hosted pay-per-hit product starts out free, often as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader">loss leader</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling">bundle</a> of geospatial services. These market realities leave some mapping use cases underserved by existing technology.
</p>

<h4>Map applications ought to outlive the SaaS business lifecycle</h4>

<p>Accessing a web map over the network isn't always practical. Maps may need to be displayed on air-gapped internal applications, or work offline without cell tower reception.</p>

<p>Also, websites and mobile applications are often built by organizations separate from their long-term maintainers (e.g. universities, museums, cultural institutions); ambitious visualization projects may be deterred by clients not wanting to foot a pay-per-hit subscription. An application depending on a hosted map service may be permanently disabled if the provider deprecates their API. <b>Hard dependencies on hosted services make software worse</b> - if your data visualization uses Google Maps, don't count on it still working in a couple years.</p>
<div>
    <div>
        <h5>Small-Scale Map Apps</h5>
        <p><a href="https://bdon.org/blog/web-map-services/80s.nyc">80s.nyc</a> is a streetview-like application for navigating historical images of New York City. It can be useful for <a href="https://medium.com/@dougbarclay/nana-at-the-doorway-4cf91888233b">discovering lost pictures of your great-grandmother</a>. Depending on a hosted basemap API would expose non-commercial projects to the whims and business models of SaaS providers.</p>

            <h3>My Engineering Axioms</h3>

            <p>A few months back I gave a talk in which I shared a list of my personal engineering axioms – things that, over the years, I've come to think of as generally true and useful to have in mind when writing code, building things, and working with others.</p>

            <p>Axiom is a fancy word, but popping a few layers off the etymology stack we arrive neatly at the ancient Greek word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1">ἀξίωμα</a>, or "that which is thought fit or worthy". I like that, and consider each item on the list at least worthy of consideration.</p>

            <p>Of course they're <b>my</b> engineering axioms – things I believe to be useful based on my own experience. Your experience may well differ. Maybe you already knew about <a href="https://martinrue.com/zzuy-a-lesson-in-perseverance/">zero termination</a>, or have better tools than <a href="https://martinrue.com/give-yourself-more-playtime/">scissors to remove bugs</a> from your programs.</p>

            <p>In any case, I thought it would be fun to share the list here, with a few brief clarifications. Some things are pretty unsurprising, but hopefully others will generate some provocative thoughts and/or interesting disagreements.</p>

            <h4>1. Change is constant.</h4>

            <p>This one shouldn't be too controversial. Almost everything is always changing, including the rate of change itself. We need to acknowledge not only that our ability to respond to change is crucial, but that how well we do it (time, cost, quality, reliability) is often a dimension of our competitiveness.</p>

            <h4>2. Your product is an asset, but code is a liability.</h4>

            <p>Your product solves your customer's problem(s), and therefore is your asset. The code itself is the cost of creating the asset. The more code you have, the more it needs to be read, tested, changed, and understood. This is especially relevant when you consider axiom 1. Accept new code (and dependency on external code) conservatively. The best code is code you don't have to write.</p>

            <h4>3. Duplication is less costly than premature abstraction.</h4>

            <p>Until you have a high degree of confidence that your abstraction is going to pay for itself because it solves a real, abstract problem you really do have, don't do it. Wait and learn more. Until then, repeating code can help avoid dependency, which itself makes the code easier to change independently or delete. A premature abstraction creates complexity through dependency and indirection, and can become a bottleneck to your ability to respond to change.</p>

            <h4>4. Code should be easy to delete.</h4>

            <p>Write code to be removable, which in large part is the same as saying "decoupled". For sure not all code needs to be similarly removable, but minimising dependencies, having clear boundaries via well-defined interfaces, and having a thoughtful overall system design allows parts to be removed/changed more easily. I once heard someone use the expression "code spent", as an alternative to "code written" and I love that. I like the implication that removing code is reducing future cost.</p>

            <h4>5. Existing code exerts a powerful influence.</h4>

            <p>The very fact it's there suggests it's correct and necessary. Hopefully it is, but not always. We need to maintain both the confidence to change it, and the ability to reason about whether we should. Don't let the existence of code itself create doubt that it can't be removed. As per axiom 4, it should be easy to remove, and the system design should be good enough to enable us to understand whether we still need it.</p>

            <h4>6. Accidental complexity is one of the biggest risks.</h4>

            <p>Accidental complexity is complexity that can be avoided, and occurs due to things like poor design, bad decisions, and not prioritising an appropriate level of simplicity within a system. If simplicity is not a goal, accidental complexity is more likely to occur as a system grows, and will gradually negatively affect almost everything from changing the system to even being able to understand it. The 2006 paper <a href="http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">Out of the Tar Pit</a> is a worthwhile read on this subject.</p>

            <h4>7. Technical excellence can be shadowed by bad personal skills.</h4>

            <p>Unless you're working completely alone, it's not just your ability to solve technical problems, to write good code, etc, that matters. To the contrary, they matter even less if you make the people around you unhappy and less productive. Just like learning to write good code, you have to learn "to people" good as well. Empathy is a big part of this, as is recognising that people are different – be caring, be understanding, help others and ask for help yourself, be nice. Be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>8. You are not your code. Be kind to the coder, not to the code.</h4>

            <p>Code is merely a moment in time that captured what we thought we knew about something. It's not you. You may have wrote it, but since that moment (even if it was 3 minutes ago) you've grown, but the code has not. A conversation about code, good or bad, should never be personal. Keep it professional. Talk about the code, or about the problem, but don't make it about the person who wrote it. Use "we" instead of "you". Sometimes I try to pretend I wrote the code someone else wrote, which helps me avoid accidentally sounding personal.</p>

            <h4>9. Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</h4>

            <p>We all start somewhere, and the journey is a lot more joyful when you're surrounded by patient people who want you to succeed, rather than those who make you feel like you don't belong. If you struggle with this, it may be helpful to remember that the newbie programmer almost certainly does something better than you do – perhaps they're fluent in another language, or cook amazingly, or play a sport. Just imagine yourself in the reverse role. How would you like them to treat you, the total newbie? Again: be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>10. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</h4>

            <p>Knowledge and understanding of the problem, the domain, the customer, are all far more important than whatever the first 3 letters on your business card are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cISYzA36-ZY?t=85">Even if it does have a watermark</a>. Understand how something works from first principles, build a solid understanding, and authority will follow.</p>

            <h4>11. Teaching is a form of learning in disguise.</h4>

            <p>If you think you know something, try teaching it. Often the very act of trying to explain what you know to someone else forces you to formalise your own thoughts much more clearly. Writing things down seems to have a similar effect. I've lost count of the number of times I've begun explaining something only to find I don't quite understand it as well as I thought.</p>

            <h4>12. Lift the skills of people around you, not just yourself.</h4>

            <p>A great team is never a great because of one amazing person. It's a great team because everyone challenges each other and everybody grows together. When you learn something cool, share it – help the people around you get better. As they do the same, everybody benefits and nobody gets left behind. It's also far more fun. Secondary benefit: axiom 11.</p>

            <h4>13. The longer you wait the more you'll know.</h4>

            <p>I'm still learning this and trying hard to avoid my almost default desire to decide quickly. The truth is, the longer you delay non-essential decisions the more information you'll have to lean on when the time comes to make it. Of course you can't always procrastinate a decision, but often you can, and as a minimum you should at least consider whether not knowing the answer right now is actually OK.</p>

            <h4>14. A good type system is worth its weight plus some.</h4>

            <p>Having gone backwards and forwards through various static and dynamic languages over my career, I'm currently of the opinion that a good type system is worth its overhead. A good type system shouldn't carry all that much overhead. If the type system is designed well, it can almost feel like a dynamic language (via features like inference and flow analysis) while removing a whole class of issues that the compiler can handle far better and quicker than you can. Developments like ownership in Rust are a nice example of how this has gone even further than people would have imagined years back.</p>

            <h4>15. The right team of people trumps everything else.</h4>

            <p>Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a lot of other problems easier to deal with. The word "right" here is highly subjective and contextual, but at least anecdotally, empathy, respect, and friendship have been recurring elements of great teams I've been part of.</p>

            <h4>16. Stick to boring technology, unless there's a good reason not to.</h4>

            <p>Boring tech is often older and better understood. There's battle-hardened experience of how to use it effectively, better understanding of its failure modes, and it's easier to find people and resources on how to best apply it. I really like Dan McKinley's idea of <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation tokens</a>. You only get 3. Use them to adopt or build brand new stuff – ideally stuff that will make you better at your core competency – but any more than 3 and the risk of never reaching stability/maturity starts to grow.</p>

            <h4>17. Have the smallest team possible, but no smaller. Grow it carefully.</h4>

            <p>A play on a well-known quote, and your mileage may vary on this one. In my career so far, I've reliably seen smaller teams be more effective than larger ones. There's a balance to be found, for sure, which depends on the magnitude and complexity of the problem you're solving. That said, smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard. In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and I feel more responsible, and I like that.</p>

            <h4>18. Rest.</h4>

            <p>I'm happy to see the gradual de-sexification of …</p></article></div>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

								• updated on December 19, 2020  
								• ID 86 —</p><p>An experimental Forward Iterator written from scratch to boost up hand-made containers.</p><div>
				
<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<p>An iterator is an object that points to an element inside a container. Like a pointer, an iterator can be used to access the element it points to and can be moved through the content of the container. Each container in the C++ Standard Library provides its own iterator, as well as some methods to retrieve it. Using iterators is quite easy: obtain an instance from a container, move it around where needed and then get the pointed element.</p>
<p>Concretely, an iterator is a simple class that provides a bunch of operators: increment <code>++</code>, dereference <code>*</code> and few others which make it very similar to a pointer and the arithmetic operations you can perform on it. In fact, iterators are a generalization of pointers, which are often used as a foundation when writing the iterator itself.</p>
<p>Iterators are one of the building blocks of the Standard Library containers, but they are also useful when you want to provide the ability to iterate over elements of a custom container that you wrote yourself: this is what I want to investigate in the present article. Adding iterators to your containers will make them compatible with the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for">range-based for loops</a> and the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm">C++ Algorithms library</a>: a collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting and manipulating containers, based on iterators.</p>
<h2>A dummy container for our experiments</h2>
<p>Before digging deeper, let's define a silly custom container that we want to spice up with iterators:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
private:
    int m_data[200];
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Integers</code> class is a wrapper around a raw array of <code>int</code>s: we want to be able to access elements of that private array through an iterator, as well as to loop over it or pass it to any of the Standard Library algorithms. Let's start by making some design decisions.</p>
<h2>Choose the nature of our iterator</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose the type of iterator we want to implement. Modern C++ defines six types:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/InputIterator">Input Iterator</a></strong></td>
<td>Can scan the container forward only once, can't change the value it points to (read-only);</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<p>The six categories are hierarchical: a Bidirectional Iterator is also a Forward Iterator and a Random Access Iterator is both a Bidirectional and a Forward Iterator and so on. Normally, all iterators are Input Iterators (1) which makes them read-only, also known as <strong>constant iterators</strong>. Iterators that both support read and write operations are also Output Iterators (2) and are called <strong>mutable iterators</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monocasual/internalpointers-files/master/2020/12/iterators/iterator-hierarchy.png" alt="Iterators hierarchy"></p><p>1. Iterators hierarchy in C++. All iterators are Input Iterators, Output Iterators or both.</p>
</div><p>Input and Output iterators are often used for low-level components such as input and output streams (the so-called <strong>single-pass algorithms</strong>) and thus have limitations. We want to do more with our custom container, so we will skip those two and jump straight to the mutable Forward Iterator.</p>
<h2>Prepare the custom iterator</h2>
<p>An iterator is usually declared inside the class it belongs to, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:
    struct Iterator { /* ... */ };

    // ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by <em>tagging</em> it with the <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/04/27/tag-dispatching/"><strong>tag dispatch</strong></a> mechanism, while C++20 uses <strong>concepts</strong>: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.</p>
<p>C++ expects some properties from an iterator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iterator_category</code> — one of the six iterator categories we have seen above. The full list is available <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator_tags">here</a>. The <code>std::forward_iterator_tag</code> tag is what we need;</li>
<li><code>difference_type</code> — a signed integer type that can be used to identify distance between iterator steps. Our iterator is basically a wrapper around a pointer and leverages pointer arithmetic, so the default <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/ptrdiff_t"><code>std::ptrdiff_t</code></a> is a good choice;</li>
<li><code>value_type</code> — the type the iterator iterates over. <code>int</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>pointer</code> — defines a pointer to the type iterated over. <code>int*</code> in our case;</li>
<li><code>reference</code> — defines a reference to the type iterated over. <code>int&amp;</code> in our case;</li>
</ul>
<p>Translated into code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iterator&gt; // For std::forward_iterator_tag
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;  // For std::ptrdiff_t

struct Iterator 
{
    using iterator_category = std::forward_iterator_tag;
    using difference_type   = std::ptrdiff_t;
    using value_type        = int;
    using pointer           = int*;  // or also value_type*
    using reference         = int&amp;;  // or also value_type&amp;
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Why are tags useful?</h3>
<p>Some of the tags above might seem useless at first. In fact, you will notice how they will never get mentioned during the definition of our iterator. Tags are used to select the most efficient algorithm if your container is passed to one of the Standard Library functions from the <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> library. Wrong tags mean sub-optimal performance! The iterator category is also used to set algorithm requirements, for example: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> wants a Forward Iterator, while <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse"><code>std::reverse</code></a> wants a Bidirectional Iterator. Passing the wrong iterator will result in a compilation error.</p>
<h2>Define the iterator constructors</h2>
<p>All iterators must be <em>constructible</em>, <em>copy-constructible</em>, <em>copy-assignable</em>, <em>destructible</em> and <em>swappable</em>. Let's translate those requirements into code for our iterator:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    Iterator(pointer ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Easy! We just need a custom constructor to initialize the private member variable <code>m_ptr</code>, which points to an element of the <code>Integers</code> container. The custom constructor satisfies the <em>constructible</em> requirement, while all others are covered by the implicitly-declared constructors and operators kindly provided by the compiler.</p>
<h2>Implement operators</h2>
<p>We are building a mutable Forward Iterator, which inherits properties from both Input and Output Iterators. The resulting iterator must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*iterator</code> and <code>iterator-&gt;x</code> — dereferenceable, to get the value it points to;</li>
<li><code>++iterator</code> and <code>iterator++</code> — incrementable, to move it one step forward, both prefix and postfix versions. The latter must return something dereferenceable;</li>
<li><code>iterator_a == iterator_b</code> and <code>iterator_a != iterator_b</code> — comparable with another iterator;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done by implementing some custom operators in the <code>Iterator</code> class, like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Iterator 
{
    // Iterator tags here...

    // Iterator constructors here...

    reference operator*() const { return *m_ptr; }
    pointer operator-&gt;() { return m_ptr; }

    // Prefix increment
    Iterator&amp; operator++() { m_ptr++; return *this; }  

    // Postfix increment
    Iterator operator++(int) { Iterator tmp = *this; ++(*this); return tmp; }

    friend bool operator== (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr == b.m_ptr; };
    friend bool operator!= (const Iterator&amp; a, const Iterator&amp; b) { return a.m_ptr != b.m_ptr; };     

private:

    pointer m_ptr;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see every operator involves the usage of the private pointer <code>m_ptr</code>. Also, notice the <code>friend</code> declaration for the two comparison operators: this is handy way to define the operators as non-member functions, yet being able to access private parts of the <code>Iterator</code> class (rationale  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/what-are-the-basic-rules-and-idioms-for-operator-overloading/4421729#4421729">here</a>).</p>
<h2>Prepare the container</h2>
<p>Our iterator is good to go. The last step is to give our custom container the ability to create <code>Iterator</code> objects. This is done by adding two public methods <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> that return instances of the <code>Iterator</code> class, representing the first and the last element respectively:</p>
<pre><code>class Integers
{
public:

    // Iterator definition here ...

    Iterator begin() { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[0]); }
    Iterator end()   { return Iterator(&amp;m_data[200]); } // 200 is out of bounds
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>end()</code> method returns an iterator that refers to an <em>invalid</em> memory address, past the end of our raw array. Such iterator is just a placeholder used to determine when the boundary has been reached: it should never be accessed directly.</p>

<!-- internalpointers responsive -->
<h2>Time to test our iterator</h2>
<p>Both the custom container and its iterator are now ready. Let's test them with the range-based for loop:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;
for (auto i : integers)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>
<p>This code will magically print the value of each integer in the container. It works because the range-based for loop is just syntactic sugar created by the compiler for the following:</p>
<pre><code>for (auto it = integers.begin(), end = integers.end(); it != end; ++it) { 
    const auto i = *it; 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";
}
</code></pre>
<p>In words: two iterators <code>it</code> and <code>end</code> are created. The first one points to the beginning of the container, the other one points to the end. Then, on each loop, the <code>it</code> iterator is incremented until it's equal to <code>end</code>, that is until the end of the container has been reached. The actual value is obtained by dereferencing <code>it</code> in a local variable before being printed.</p>
<p>Notice how the compiler makes use of all the operators and functions we have previously implemented: the <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> methods in the custom container, the ability to compare the two iterators with the <code>!=</code> operator, the ability to increment <code>it</code> with the prefix syntax and finally the ability to dereference it to grab the actual value it points to.</p>
<p>Let's now try a function from the Algorithm library, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/fill"><code>std::fill</code></a> for example:</p>
<pre><code>Integers integers;

std::fill(integers.begin(), integers.end(), 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The function assigns all elements in the container the value <code>3</code>. It works because <code>std::fill</code> is usually implemented like this:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename ForwardIterator, …</code></pre></div></div>

This could make it easier for healthcare providers to estimate the expected clinical picture.</p><p>This study, conducted in eleven hospitals, has now been published in the scientific journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felifesciences.org%2Farticles%2F63195&amp;t=ZDAzYjJiYTQ0ZjczZTM0ZmU2Yzg3YjdmZGU3YzljNzEyY2I2YmIyZSxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608814250"><i>eLife</i></a>.</p><p>In patients presenting to hospitals with a COVID-19 infection, full blood count analysis (hemocytometry) are commonly performed at the emergency department and during hospitalization. COVID-19 is accompanied by specific changes in the circulating blood cells that are analyzed by a full blood count. These changes in the blood cells, especially those that can be identified using new techniques, are used to create an algorithm with a predictive value. The developed algorithm appears to predict the course of COVID-19 better than the value of the individual blood cells, as used so far. The reliability increases to 93% after six days.</p><h2><b>Predicting disease progression</b></h2><p>Using data generated by full blood count measurements, the researchers wanted to know whether it is possible to predict whether a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become seriously ill and needs treatment at the Intensive Care. For this purpose, they examined the data of 982 adult patients in eleven different hospitals across Europe. And this turned out to be possible: specific changes in the circulating blood cells of COVID-19 patients proved to be of use as indicators whether a serious course of events was expected. New laboratory techniques make it possible to detect whether immune cells in the blood are activated and it turned out that especially these activated cells were more present of COVID-19 patients with a severe course, including during the early course of the disease. In a second study population the researchers were able to confirm the value of the prognostic score.</p><h2><b>Cheap and available</b></h2><p>Internist-infectiologist and principal investigator André van der Ven of Radboud university medical center explains: “A full blood count is a fully automated, inexpensive, immediately available measurement and one of the most requested laboratory determinations in the world. Full blood count measurements are also routinely requested from COVID-19 patients who present to the hospital. By using certain techniques, the character of certain blood cells can be better determined and by using these new techniques, we have been able to develop a reliable prognostic score. This score gives a good insight into whether a serious course of events can be expected and can help healthcare professionals to make treatment decisions”.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radboudumc.nl%2Fen%2Fnews-items%2F2020%2Ffull-blood-count-covid-19-patients-predict-disease-severity&amp;t=NTZiN2JkY2U3MGQ5YzQyNWU2YjNjZWExNmRiNDQ0NTUwODZkMDgzNCxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608814250">Radboud University Medical Center</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“A novel haemocytometric COVID-19 prognostic score developed and validated in an observational multicentre European hospital-based study”, <i>eLife</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.7554%2FeLife.63195&amp;t=NDI3Y2U1OWQwZTQwOTAwMTE0MzVkZWY3MTNkYWY3ZGQ3N2I3NjJiYSxPdnJTNlR3WA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F638153014113370112%2Ffull-blood-count-covid19-prediction&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608814250">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63195</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632175500576653312/blood-test-covid19-infection-prediction">Novel blood test predicts which COVID-19 patients will develop severe infection</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many people report they're feeling depressed during the pandemic. The gyms are closed so exercise options are limited. You don't get to see people as much. The routines are all different— you might have lost touch with friends, there are no serendipitous conversations at work, you can't go out to a restaurant or to see a movie. That would put anybody in low spirits.</p><p>But not me. I'm extremely well adapted to the pandemic. I can busy myself with reading, studying or programming and almost never get bored. Chatting over text feels as real to me as meeting in person. In many ways text is <em>better—</em> I can multitask, talk to different groups of friends, be in my pajamas. I don't miss going out. Restaurants are filled with annoyances like noise and waiting for the check. The food delivery experience feels strictly better. I don't have to sit in traffic or go to events I never liked. The new routine has made me surprisingly happy.</p><p>Because I spend so much time at home I made everything cozy. I'm surrounded by my favorite books. I get the exact amount and the type of light I need (which is dim and incandescent orange). I get more and better sleep, the kitchen is stocked with the food I like, the pajamas are soft. I can take baths in the middle of the day! There is good coffee. People get to control only some aspects of our environment, but now my home <em>is</em> the environment. I get to control all of it. I can't remember a time when I was as comfortable.</p><p>Comfort begets comfort. I've always said no to unnecessary errands, but the pandemic made it clear how much further that can go. If I was too conservative saying no before, could I be too conservative saying it now? I tested it, and it turned out that I was. For example, when people asked for Zoom I tried saying "let's work it out over text". And that turned out to be enough! I've always preferred conversations to meetings, and text feels far more conversational than Zoom. Now people know to reach me via text. Over the last six months I've eliminated nearly everything I don't want to do.</p><p>One outcome of this experiment is tranquility. The other is that I get more done than ever. I read, write, study, code and talk to people <em>more</em> than I did before. I can't remember the last time I sat down and read for two uninterrupted hours before the pandemic. Now I do it regularly. The combination of extra time, fewer interruptions, and less frustration feels like I'm operating at a lower frequency. This frequency feels optimal for productivity. The frequency prior to the pandemic was far too high.</p><p>But there are negative side effects to comfort. I find myself saying no where I should be saying yes. Less physical movement means it's harder to keep a healthy weight. Lack of strenuous exercise makes me downright lazy— I notice myself resisting anything that would cause even small amounts of stress. I don't lose a sense of urgency, but I do find it harder to convince myself to perform entire classes of work. None of this makes me unhappy. My limbic system is ok with it, but the rational part of my brain knows these effects aren't good for me. They remind me of an excerpt from Kahlil Gibran:</p><blockquote><p>    Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master?</p><p>    Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.<br>    Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.<br>    It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.<br>    It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.<br>    Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.</p><p>    But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.<br>    Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.</p></blockquote><p>So it isn't enough to be comfortable. Comfort needs to be balanced with stress. What type of stress is the right stress? I'm still experimenting, but I have early results. This is <code>N=1</code> and I don't know if the conclusions generalize. YMMV.</p><p>High intensity interval training (HIIT) always lifts my mood, gives me more energy, and makes it much easier to take on the day or to handle bad news. The stock market tanking is bad,  but not nearly as bad if you did twenty minutes of burpees. This effect is stronger after doing martial arts. I don't know yet if it's because the intensity is higher and longer, or because there is a social component. I noticed I don't get any of these effects after long slow runs, or after lifting heavy weights. I am not sure why.</p><p>Cold water has roughly the same psychological effects on me as HIIT. The effects plateau after about fifteen seconds under a cold shower. It works much better if the head and face are under the stream. There is effect without that, but it's more limited. I haven't looked at the data and I don't know if this is safe to do consistently. People make all sorts of pseudoscientific claims about health benefits of cold water— I'm not doing that; I just know it has an effect on my psychology.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> goals have incredibly powerful effects, but only with an additional property— I have to care about the goal. If I have to ship a feature by Monday and I care about the product, I will be focused and excited all through the weekend. It works even better if I know other people are depending on me. But the inverse, if people depend on me but I don't care about the goal, is destructive stress. Those situations make me miserable beyond belief.</p><p>Sleep matters a lot, and it's surprisingly fussy. About 8.5 hours is optimal. Less than 8 or more than 9 leaves me grumpy for the rest of the day.</p><p>I found that contrary to conventional wisdom diet quality makes no difference. I can eat pizzas all day or healthy gourmet meals— if I get the calories in it doesn't matter. On the other hand my weight does matter. About 165lbs (the uppermost point of my healthy BMI) is optimal. Any less and I start feeling weak. More than 175lbs and my mood starts to suffer. Meditation, supplements, and proximity to nature also don't matter.</p><p>I have a much longer list of how different conditions affect me, but from talking to friends I know these mappings are idiosyncratic. The meta argument is that tinkering with the right and wrong types of comfort and stress can make a dramatic difference on your productivity and subjective experience. It doesn't even require much work! You have to pay attention to how your psychology responds to situations and be willing to make changes. After a while it becomes automatic. And since your life situation and priorities change with time, the tinkering process never ends.</p></div></div>]]>

However, this approach also comes with a minor drawback: the need to manage many Lambdas’ dependencies.</p><p id="7083">Or at least it used to! Architect 8.4 introduces a new concept we call Lambda Node.js modules treeshaking.</p><h2 id="3e13">How Lambda treeshaking works</h2><p id="a062">If you’d like to take advantage of the nearly 1.5 million publicly published Node.js modules, your Architect app may have numerous individual <code>package.json</code> files spread across its various Lambdae. Here’s an example file tree of how such a project might look:</p><pre><span id="2740">/<br>├─ src/<br>│  └─ http<br>│     ├─ get-index<br>│     │  ├─ index.js<br>│     │  └─ package.json<br>│     ├─ post-api<br>│     │ ├─ index.js<br>│     │ └─ package.json<br>│     └─ put-api<br>│        ├─ index.js<br>│        └─ package.json<br>├─ app.arc<br>└─ package.json</span></pre><p id="3adc">Architect 8.4’s Lambda Node.js modules treeshaking now automatically statically analyzes all of your Lambdas’ business logic and manages each of their dependencies from the root. This means:</p><ul><li id="2067">You only ever have to install dependencies one time in one place: your root <code>package.json</code></li><li id="a93c">Similarly, upgrading, removing, or otherwise maintaining dependencies happens in your root as well</li><li id="388e">Perhaps our favorite: no more having to keep dozens (or hundreds) of individual <code>package[-lock].json</code> files in your repo</li></ul><p id="ddab">Now the project above looks like this:</p><pre><span id="2f19">/<br>├─ src/<br>│  └─ http<br>│     ├─ get-index<br>│     │  └─ index.js<br>│     ├─ post-api<br>│     │  └─ index.js<br>│     └─ put-api<br>│        └─ index.js<br>├─ app.arc<br>└─ package.json</span></pre><h2 id="c769">Get started with Lambda treeshaking</h2><p id="a614">For starters, make sure you’re running Architect 8.4 (<code>npm i @architect/architect@latest</code>)!</p><p id="4815">For new projects, taking advantage of Lambda treeshaking is as simple as adding dependencies to your project’s root <code>package.json</code> file (and <code>require()</code>ing¹ them in your business logic).</p><p id="2815">For existing projects, any Lambdas that already have their own <code>package.json</code> will continue to have their dependencies wholly managed by you, meaning you can choose to mix and match dependency management on a per-Lambda basis.</p><p id="11fd">We think this is a massive step forward in the ergonomics of building cloud function-native applications — we’d love to hear what you think in <a href="https://architecture-as-text.slack.com/archives/C6BGT0D08/p1600199636147600" rel="noopener">Architect’s Slack</a>!</p><p id="6444">¹ Architect will ship ESM support when Lambda ships Node.js 14 support; dynamic requires are not supported</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*gLbMxDzidLVqVwjW.png" width="276" height="400" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/42/0*gLbMxDzidLVqVwjW.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Art by <a href="https://www.michaelramstead.com/" rel="noopener">Michael Ramstead</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All right, Voltaires, today we have the second part of my conversation with Danny Cullenward and David Victor, authors of the new book <em><a href="https://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509541799">Making Climate Policy Work</a></em>. (See <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/why-carbon-pricing-will-never-be">part one</a> for their credentials and background.)</p><p>The book, you will recall, is an extended argument that carbon pricing schemes, despite their attractiveness in economic theory, run afoul of fundamental forces in political economy.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/why-carbon-pricing-will-never-be">part one</a> we talked about why people love carbon pricing so much and why, despite promises of expansion, most carbon pricing system still only cover a narrow band of economic sectors. </p><p>Today we tackle two more of the book’s big topics. </p><p>The first is carbon offsets. A carbon offset is basically a payment to a third party to take some carbon-reducing action — plant trees, prevent deforestation, capture and bury carbon, what have you. The idea is that entities for whom reducing direct emissions is expensive or impossible can still pay for reductions. </p><p>In the context of carbon pricing systems, offsets are designed to play two roles. First, they are supposed to hold prices down, since they are often cheaper than direct reductions. And second, they are supposed to allow carbon pricing systems to reduce emissions even in sectors that are not covered by the system and are otherwise difficult to reach. </p><p>Like carbon pricing itself, carbon offsets are an appealing idea. Pay less, for more emission reductions, and help save forests while you do it! More and more cities, states, and companies are making net-zero pledges without really knowing how to get there, so lots of them are looking around for cheap reductions, and carbon offsets are sitting right there.</p><p>But the model only works in practice if the carbon reductions represented by carbon offsets are real — verifiable and verified. Cullenward and Victor argue that they rarely are, and furthermore, that the incentives created by the programs themselves work against reliable verification. Large-scale offsets programs inevitably spark a race to the bottom.</p><p>Second, we talk about linkages. Just as carbon pricing programs were supposed to expand to cover more economic sectors, they were supposed to expand to bring in more jurisdictions, more states and countries. That hasn’t happened either, and the explanation turns out to be more or less the same.</p><p>Let’s jump in!</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4410c8-248f-43fe-80bf-04301a359d0c_1100x55.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c4410c8-248f-43fe-80bf-04301a359d0c_1100x55.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c4410c8-248f-43fe-80bf-04301a359d0c_1100x55.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:55,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2227,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><h3>Carbon offsets haven’t worked, don’t work, and won’t work</h3><h4>David Roberts</h4><p>Let’s talk about carbon offsets, a perpetually hot topic. Offsets do a lot of work in carbon pricing systems, easing the political difficulties that the pricing systems themselves create. That would be fine if they were reliable and verifiable. But you guys say they're not, and what’s more, never will be. Explain. </p><h4>Danny Cullenward</h4><p>There's two parts. First is the difficulty in saying what a good offset is. The second is the politics — what offsets are for and how the money gets used. </p><p>The fundamental problem with offsets is that we can't observe what doesn't happen. The offset project is making a claim: if you didn't pay us, we wouldn't do this thing. It's a counterfactual claim that's factually unobservable. You can only infer, by evidence, reasoning, and detailed sector-specific knowledge, what might or might not happen. That's a challenging problem in the best of circumstances. </p><p>Everyone imagines there's this vast army of people working on this problem, ensuring that there's a good outcome, but in practice, you see understaffed regulators — very few people paying close attention to this who have no financial interests. And you see special-interest nonprofit organizations figuring out if they line up behind these offset programs, they can direct the revenues to particular causes. </p><p>An offset is basically a way of channeling a compliance obligation on a polluter to some third-party activity. So if you can direct the flow of those funds, that's powerful. Just a quick data point: in California, there's over 200 million offset credits, easily worth 10 bucks apiece. That's $2 billion in private financial flows that have moved through a regulatory program that has fewer than a dozen full-time staff members. </p><p>That problem is massive — you lose that fight every time, because of the fundamental political economy of offsets. Almost everywhere they've been used in compliance programs, they’ve been used for cost containment. </p><p>The story is, I can deliver a climate pollution reduction somewhere else at lower cost. If the quality of that offset credit is identical to a reduction inside the program, you have no change in emissions, you just have lower costs.</p><h4>David Roberts</h4><p>Again, a very appealing theory.</p><h4>Danny Cullenward  </h4><p>It's very elegant. </p><p>It's important to point out some of the environmental justice [EJ] concerns. If you don't reduce your pollution here, the people who experience the local air pollution associated with, say, a refinery have sincere and legitimate concerns. But assuming we solved the local air-quality problem and the EJ problem, it's an appealing theory, for sure. </p><p>The political problem is that these programs want offsets to keep costs down. To be honest, they don't particularly care about quality. At the end of the day, their bottom line is about increasing the volume at the lowest possible cost. </p><p>So the fundamental political economy is structured around massive volumes of low-priced offsets — the most problematic ones. It becomes a race to the bottom, where people compete on price and not quality. </p><p>And nobody really cares about quality in these public markets. That's why in every single major compliance offsets program, you see this downward spiral in quality. They are not about achieving comparable environmental aims. They are about reducing compliance costs. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.volts.wtf/p/carbon-offsets-arent-working-and?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/carbon-offsets-arent-working-and?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><h4>David Roberts</h4><p>Is there not a single offset program you could point to that has fought off these trends and maintained high quality?</p><h4>Danny Cullenward</h4><p>I'll be honest, I spend a lot of time working on this and it's hard for me to point to a lot that's working well. </p><p>The counter-examples are, you're starting to see some companies in the private sector say that they don't care what the price is, they’re only concerned with quality. Those private sector buyers are going to help create markets for quality offsets. </p><p>There are some small-scale things you can point to, but when you look to large volumes of offset credits at low prices, I don't think there's a single program that's delivered that successfully.</p><h4>David Victor</h4><p>I agree. The place to watch is voluntary markets amongst folks who understand the quality problem, understand the logic of why offsets, if they can be done with integrity, are important. </p><p>One of the reasons offsets persist, keep coming back like bell-bottoms, is that you now see a bunch of companies and governments under enormous pressure to make net-zero pledges. </p><p>It’s coming from the right place. But when they go do the numbers, they have a heart attack. They don't know what to do, especially if you go all the way up to scope-three emissions. [Scope-three emissions — indirect emissions embedded in a company’s or jurisdiction’s supply chains — are explained <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions">here</a>.]</p><p>So they all say the right things in public: we want to make all the reductions ourselves to the extent possible, yada yada. Meanwhile, the analysts say, you've made this public pledge, how are you going to do this? The only backstop answer is offsets. </p><p>So they almost have to imagine that these problems of quality don't exist, or can be solved — “<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/11/10/mark-carney-oversees-blueprint-scaling-carbon-market-offset-demand-soars/">Mark Carney is working on it</a>, so it'll be fine.” Once that magic wand is waved and offsets are available, net zero is possible. The sad irony here is that a lot of companies and governments are trying to do the right thing, but net-zero pledges are propagating the belief that offsets are working fine.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F438ea9bb-ba85-4280-a2e0-7c77cfb3cadb_5000x3328.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F438ea9bb-ba85-4280-a2e0-7c77cfb3cadb_5000x3328.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/438ea9bb-ba85-4280-a2e0-7c77cfb3cadb_5000x3328.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2927396,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a><figcaption>Alaskan forests, shrouded and opaque, much like carbon offsets. (Photo: Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><h4>David Roberts</h4><p>There’s an argument to be made that if these companies and governments didn’t have access to offsets, and just had to reduce their direct and indirect emissions on their own, it would appear so daunting and terrifying that you'd get less support. Perhaps having a release valve in offsets is enabling these corporations and jurisdictions to feel confident enough to step up at all. Do you worry about cutting that off?</p><h4>Danny Cullenward</h4><p>That's the political trap of starting with a flawed paradigm. </p><p>I'm trying to make a slightly different case to them for what to do. Take a company that has made a bold pledge and set aside a budget for this. I don't want them to reduce the funds they’re putting into climate, I want them to grow that over time, and I think a lot of companies get that and want to do that. But is that money going to good things?</p><p>When you're competing on price and nobody's looking over quality, difficult things that are real can't compete. So we need to break the current relationship between price and effort in these systems. People need to stop pretending that we can cheaply offset our way to net-zero goals. </p><p>To a company that has been blindly purchasing generic offsets and is becoming aware of these problems — don't stop. Take the money and make the most of it. That means not fetishizing tonnage claims and the implementation of net zero. </p><p>That's a difficult thing to do, because people have made all these bold pledges. But we have to figure out a way to search for quality. We don't see that working in offsets. </p><h4>David Roberts</h4><p>What about the fact that there are big emitting sectors that are problematic and don't fit well under a carbon pricing system? Are there ways to get at them other than offsets?</p><h4>Danny Cullenward</h4><p>When people say offsets can help us get to sectors we can't otherwise get to, you need to remember two things. </p><p>First, what does it take to do a good offsets program? It means you know a great deal about what's going on in that sector, what's possible, what's not possible, who's doing it — you need all of this detailed information. To set your additionality standards and baselines and all the technical …</p></div></div>

<p>Today marks the 77th day since I got onboarded to <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse, for those not familiar with it, is essentially an audio-first social network.</a> It’s kind of a mix between Reddit and a podcast. An interactive radio show. The app lets you jump into different chat rooms and participate in – or just listen to – live audio conversations around different topics.</p>



<p>It’s an exciting product. <br>And yet, in these last 77 days, I have actively used Clubhouse exactly three times.</p>



<p>The problem with Clubhouse is that you can only listen to conversations live as they happen. Given that the majority of the current user base is in North America, the most interesting conversations usually happen in the middle of the (European) night when I’m asleep.</p>



<p>The first thing I see on my phone after I wake up are a handful of Clubhouse notifications telling me about the all the interesting conversations I missed. I wish I could just download these conversations as podcasts and listen to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/clubhouse.png"></p><p>Some have pointed out that the live nature of Clubhouse is exactly what makes it so special, comparing it to the ephemerality of Snapchat. And while I disagree on the Snapchat comparison <span>(ephemerality ≠ synchronous creation and consumption)</span>, I do think it makes sense for Clubhouse to find its own native format rather than compete with podcasts directly.</p>



<p>While Clubhouse feels like live podcasts at the moment, I think over time it will probably evolve into something else. Something more unique.</p>



<p>The current state of Clubhouse reminds me of the early days of Twitter: People knew it was a unique new form factor, but they didn’t know how to use it yet. Most tweets were just short status updates. It took some time until the platform found its current form and use cases.</p>



<p>One of those use cases is “Twitter as a second screen”: Live commenting TV shows and sports events. I strongly suspect that this will become one of Clubhouse’s main uses cases as well.</p>



<p>As I pointed out in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/04/19/airpods-as-a-platform/">Airpods as a Platform</a>, I see audio primarily as a secondary interface: You listen to music while you’re working out, for example. You consume podcasts while you are driving or commuting. You talk on Discord while you’re playing a game.</p>



<p>Audio is a medium that supports and augments other activities.</p>



<p>So instead of thinking about whether Clubhouse should make conversations available as downloads, a perhaps more interesting question is what activities could best be augmented with live audio? What does Clubhouse as an audio layer for other content look like?</p>



<p>The most obvious use case seems to be sports (and other events that have to be consumed live). I would love to replace the audio track of my TV sports broadcasters with a select group of (Clubhouse) experts whose opinions I’m <em>actually</em> interested in.</p>



<p>I wonder what other events or activities this would work for. <br><a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1341044261526130691">Do you have any ideas?</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>In Dan Abramov's blog post <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/">"Making setInterval Declarative with React Hooks"</a>, he writes about a custom React hook to wrap the native Javascript function, setInterval. The first time I read the article, I thought it was interesting, but I was not convinced by the power of custom hooks until I got the chance to use it in action. That opportunity came when I was designing a music progress bar component. The switch from using <code>setInterval</code> to <code>useInterval</code> resulted in a dramatic reduction in code size and a cleaner design.</p>
<p>The design of <code>useInterval</code> is fairly simple. It looks similar to <code>useEffect</code>, where the first parameter is a callback function. It differs though in the second parameter, which is a number in milliseconds:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>useInterval</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>    
  
  <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>  
<span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>1000</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Importantly, the second parameter can also be a ternary conditional expression as well, which is key to the design I explain in this article. If it is a conditional, like <code>shouldCount <span>?</span> <span>1000</span> <span>:</span> <span>null</span></code> then it will only run the callback function if <code>shouldCount</code> is true. </p>
<p>I won't go into the gory details about how <code>useInterval</code> works behind the scenes here. For that, read Abramov's blog; it will do a much better job than I can.</p>
<h2>The original progress bar design</h2>
<p>With some omissions for brevity, here is what the original progress bar looked like:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>ProgressBar</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> elapsed<span>,</span> songs<span>,</span> runtime<span>,</span> isPaused<span>,</span> deviceID<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> dispatch <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>progressIntervalID<span>,</span> setProgressIntervalID<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>progressIntervalID<span>]</span></span><span>)</span>

  <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

  );</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, even with some of the other logic removed, this component was a bit of a beheamoth. Most of the ugliness stems from the three separate <code>useEffect</code> calls that were responsible for updating the progress bar. </p>
<p>The first function intended to carefully manage the state of the timers when the pause state changed or the song ended. This probably would have been cleaner if it were split up into multiple reducers managing the state of the progress bar and the pause/play button, but that's not the design I had at the time. Instead, the function would trigger when <code>isPaused</code> changed. Then, if the song were playing (<code>!isPaused</code>) and the timer was not already active, it would create a new interval timer that updated every 50 ms. If the song was paused and the timer was already active, it would stop the clock. It would do the same when the song ended (<code>elapsed &gt;= runtimeMS</code>).</p>
<p>Alongside this, the second function would reset the progress bar when a song had been skipped, and the third function would clear all timers when React dismounted the component. Adding to the overhead is the need for local state variables for tracking the id of the setInterval function, and for tracking whether the timer was active.</p>
<p>Yikes. I won't pretend this was good design. It's confusing, difficult to read, and very fragile for such an important component in a music player. There may have been ways to improve the design while retaining setInterval, but after coming across <code>useInterval</code>, I decided to rewrite it using the custom hook in order to simplify the component.</p>
<h2>Switching to useInterval</h2>
<p>First of all, I installed <a href="https://github.com/donavon/use-interval">an implementation of useInterval</a> with <code>npm i @use-it/interval</code>. Here's the new version:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>ProgressBar</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> elapsed<span>,</span> songs<span>,</span> runtime<span>,</span> isPaused<span>,</span> deviceID<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> dispatch <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>shouldIncrement<span>,</span> setShouldIncrement<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
  
  <span>useInterval</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>'increment-elapsed'</span><span>,</span> increment<span>:</span> <span>50</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> shouldIncrement <span>?</span> <span>50</span> <span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span>

  
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setShouldIncrement</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>isPaused <span>&amp;&amp;</span> songs<span>.</span>length <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>isPaused<span>,</span> songs<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>elapsed <span>&gt;=</span> runtime<span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>songs<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
        <span>setShouldIncrement</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
      <span>dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>'next-song'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>elapsed<span>,</span> runtime<span>,</span> room<span>,</span> songs<span>,</span> dispatch<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>SliderInput</span></span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>w-full pb-6 mb-1 md:mb-0<span>"</span></span> <span>min</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>0</span><span>}</span></span> <span>max</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>runtimeMS<span>}</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>elapsed<span>}</span></span> <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  );</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should be able to see at a glance that this has a much cleaner design. Instead of the confusing and long first <code>useEffect</code> in the original design, most of that behavior is now handled by a conditional usage of <code>useInterval</code>. Again, I'll emphasize here the importance of the second parameter to <code>useInterval</code>: <code> shouldIncrement <span>?</span> <span>50</span> <span>:</span> <span>null</span></code>. This simple ternary sets the callback function to trigger every 50 ms if <code>shouldIncrement</code> is true. In that callback function, all we have to do is increment the state of the progress bar. This kind of conditional is a powerful and expressive change to the design of setInterval which makes this hook such a joy to use.</p>
<p>How do we know what <code>shouldIncrement</code> should be? that's what the other two <code>useEffect</code> calls are for. The first updates shouldIncrement if a song is playing and there is a song in queue. The second one simply turns off the interval when the song reaches the end.</p>
<p>This new design is simpler, easier to read, and less buggy since manually managing the timer has been abstracted away with <code>useInterval</code>. That means there is no need for additional state variables to hold the id of the timer and whether it is active in this new design.</p>
<p>Now, it's certainly not perfect, since it still relies on <code>useEffect</code> to update state when other state changes. That is usually not a best practice, but fixing that problem involved a better global state management design that I did not understand how to implement at the time I wrote this component. I'm also still a student of React, so forgive me for any other design errors.</p>
<p>Still, switching to <code>useInterval</code> resulted in a marked improvement, and if your React code requires carefully managing timers, I would recommend considering a switch to it.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After a nice and calm summer the second wave caught up with us here in Switzerland and we are back to working from home full time.</p><p>When the federal government mandated that people work from home whenever possible, many companies were thrown into a situation they weren’t prepared to handle. Nevertheless, all over the world people proved how adaptable humans are. Given the circumstances, I think this big experiment was mostly a success.</p><p>Luckily, even before the Coronavirus Pandemic and prior to my <a href="https://www.granviaje.ch/">sabbatical</a>, I had experience with remote work as I worked with distributed teams and I managed a team of engineers in three different timezones.</p><p>I can’t stress enough that you cannot just transplant your office processes into the remote world and think things will work the same. They might for a while, but long-term your team will burn-out.</p><p>Working from home (or working with a distributed team) requires a different philosophy.</p><h2 id="accommodate-the-people-who-do-not-have-a-home-office">Accommodate the people who do not have a “home office”</h2><p>We need to acknowledge and keep in mind that not everybody has the environment at home to work full time.</p><p>For people in smaller apartments with families and kids, for example, it can be difficult to get something done. This is especially true when schools are closed. Give your employees the time to breathe they need, support them by providing the necessary equipment to work from home, and let them chose the hours that work best for them. If they are not able to put in 8 hours of work, that’s ok too. A lockdown is temporary. Family goes first. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-company-isnt-a-family/">No, we are not family at work</a>.</p><h2 id="asynchronous-communication">Asynchronous Communication</h2><p>Working with a fully remote team provides some unique chances to improve on what most people don’t like about offices: Constant interruptions, noise, and long meetings</p><p><strong>If</strong> you have a dedicated home office, the quietness and calmness of working from home can be a godsend. However, we need to be mindful of the attention hogs like Slack and other real-time communication tools.
One of the most frequent complaints I hear is that people can’t focus on a task because of constant interruptions.</p><p>As a team lead, set the guidelines and embrace asynchronous communication.</p><p>It takes a while to get used to, but writing down a question properly often results in new insights and you might not even need somebody else’s input after formulating the question.</p><h2 id="keeping-the-spirit">Keeping the Spirit</h2><p>Many people say that “company culture” gets lost when everybody is remote. That’s not true. If your culture gets lost when people cannot go to the office, there wasn’t much of a culture to begin with. What is true, however, is that your company’s culture might change.</p><p>When everybody is in their own home it’s harder to keep a personal connection. Schedule some additional time in your rituals at the beginning so people can just chat. We also have a “virtual water fountain” channel where people can share non-work related stuff and hang out at coffee breaks.
We also have an ongoing “open window”-meet where people can hang out during work to see each other. This is completely optional and not everybody likes to do that. But I like to have a place that I can join when I take a coffee break or before ending the day just to hang out.
I am not a big fan of forcing the team to have a good time together. Listen to them and ask them what they would like to do. Maybe your team would like a little hackathon afternoon or a game night or just having a drink while chatting in the open window?</p><h2 id="reduce-interruptions">Reduce Interruptions</h2><p>If you are using Slack as a primary means of communication, agree on when it’s ok to <code>@</code> mention someone. For example, in my team we have the following three categories of questions:</p><ol><li>Non-urgent: Are prefixed with a ❓</li><li>Questions that need answers in a few minutes have a 🚨 prefix</li><li>For truly important questions, we tag the “on-duty” engineer in your question</li></ol><p>Since we are operating the platform behind <a href="https://www.ricardo.ch/">Ricardo</a> interruptions can happen anytime. To reduce the impact on the team, we have a weekly rotation of an “SRE on Duty”. The SoD is responsible to answer questions from the developers, on-call engineers, or is the first to jump into incidents. They also tackle any unplanned work that needs to be taken care of.</p><p>This setup allows the rest of the team to disable most notifications and work uninterrupted.</p><h2 id="personal-well-being">Personal Well-Being</h2><p>Everybody is different and has different needs. Following are a few recommendations that have worked for me in the past and might be helpful for others. In the end, you have to figure out what works and what is important for your well-being.</p><ul><li>Don’t forget to treat yourself. Go for a walk over lunch, eat fruits, do something to relax. Not going to the office also means you will miss out on all the walking you usually do to get to the office and inside the office.</li><li>Make your home office comfortable and ergonomic. Get an adjustable desk and chair. Invest in a good 4k screen (e.g. HP Z27 or Dell U2720Q), a good keyboard and a mouse (e.g. Logitech MX Master 3).</li><li>There are no hero awards for working overtime. Of course, sometimes there is the need for a short sprint, but we are in it for the long haul.</li><li>Track your time for yourself. You’ll be surprised how much you work.</li><li>If you have trouble winding down at the end of the day, one thing that can help is to ask yourself “Have I done a good day’s work?” Answering that question is liberating. Often, if the answer is an easy “yes”, you can stop working feeling satisfied that something important got accomplished. Should the answer be “no”, you can treat it as an off-day and explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five Whys</a>.</li><li>Creating a routine can help to get into a working mood and out of working wood. Eg. walk around the block before and after work.</li><li>It’s recommended that you have separate devices for work and pleasure. For example, if you want to watch something in the evening on Netflix, it is very tempting to “just check an email” and get sucked back into work.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>The following blog posts and books inspired the content of this blog post:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/LoveInATimeOfCoronaVirusTipsTricksAndBestPracticesForWorkingRemotely.aspx">Love in a time of Corona Virus - Tips, Tricks and Best Practices for Working Remotely</a></li><li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">GitLab’s Guide to All-Remote</a></li><li>Remote: Office Not Required <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00CZ7OC46/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">[Amazon]</a></li><li>Rework: It doesn’t have to be crazy at work <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780">[Amazon]</a></li><li><a href="https://dev.to/nebojsac/slack-keeps-interrupting-you-but-you-can-stop-it-883">Slack keeps interrupting you, but you can stop it</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

				<p>Soy is the main ingredient in our cheese. Surprisingly often, we get asked some version of this question: "Isn't soy bad for the environment?"</p><p>The short answer is: No, quite the contrary.</p><p>The rest of this post is devoted to the long answer.</p><p>Since we started working on <a href="https://yeticheese.com/">Yeti Cheese</a>, we realized that there's a lot of misinformation around soybean. Over and over, we read and hear stuff about soy that is just plain wrong from people that otherwise seem smart. I wonder who might be behind this? <em>*cough* meat and dairy lobbies *cough*</em></p><p>A lot of this misinformation is around environmental concerns. This belief originates from the fact that soy is a major driver of deforestation, especially in the Amazon and neighboring regions in South America. Which is true. But that's not the end of the story. What is often left out is that the vast majority of soy is grown to be used as animal feed. There are different estimates to what this number exactly is, but most are upwards of 90%.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg" alt="" width="993" height="1121" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/EoDe4BMWMAAMl_c.jpg 993w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Break-down of soybean usage based on USDA data.</figcaption></figure><p>As the above diagram shows, the USDA reports that only 6% of soy are used as food for humans (e.g. as tofu or Yeti Cheese 😝). The rest is used either directly as animal feed, or processed to soy cake (also called soy meal) and then given to cows, pigs and chickens.</p><h3 id="but-what-about-soy-oil">But what about soy oil?</h3><p>The astute reader will now raise a remark about soy oil. After all, 19% of the processed soybean is made into oil which is consumed mostly by humans. Soy oil is one of the most used oils globally, but only because it is cheaply available as a by-product of soy cake production. Soy cake has great nutritional values and almost no fat (which has been separated into the soy oil) and is therefore sought after as livestock feed. Hence, soy cake is the main driver of soy demand, and not soy oil. There's nothing unique about soy oil, and it can easily be substituted with other plant-based oils.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="636" srcset="https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 600w, https://blog.yeticheese.com/content/images/2020/12/soy-meal-vs-soy-oil.jpg 853w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Soy oil vs soy meal.

It's clear that shifting the population to a plant-based diet will reduce the demand for soy dramatically. This shift will also make free a lot of land where wild vegetation and biodiversity can be restored, capturing loads of carbon in the process.</p><p>So no, soy is not bad for the environment. Quite the contrary: It's one of the best food sources we have available on this little blue planet of ours.</p><h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3><p><a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(09)00966-2/fulltext">Clinical studies show no effects of soy protein or isoflavones on reproductive hormones in men: results of a meta-analysis</a></p><p><a href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy">Soy Agriculture in the Amazon Basin</a></p>

But in recent years, the walls began to close in, as the press and regulators and lawyers and state attorneys general began to investigate Purdue’s role in the epidemic. And as pressure rose, to whom did the Sacklers turn to vouch for them?</p><p>The museums that had taken their philanthropy.</p><p>The Ink has seen a tranche of the Sacklers’ WhatsApp group chats as members of the family sought to cope with and strategize about their fall from grace and growing legal risk. They were quietly released as part of an ongoing bankruptcy proceeding, thanks to <a href="https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/purduepharma/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTEzMTYxMQ==&amp;id2=0">demands by multiple news organizations</a>. A source provided them to The Ink, which is the first publication to report on them. (To assist better-resourced follow-up reporting, The Ink will now offer to collaborate with larger news organizations.)</p><p>The messages show how, in the plutocratic echelons, it is assumed that philanthropic gifts made in sunny times can buy you public support from prestigious institutions on a rainy day. They show how a family that could no longer deny the scale of pain and death in the country tended to view the problem primarily through the prism of public relations, their anger concentrated on the difficulty of crafting statements, not curbing the hurt. And the messages show how a profound sense of victimhood descended on some members of the family, perhaps blinding them to the need to address the problem in the way one relative suggested: at a cost to their bottom line.</p><p>“We are the most vulnerable of the opponents (as we are a private family owned business) and in their view the easiest prey to get lots of money from!,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Mortimer Sackler</a>, son of a deceased family patriarch by the same name, texted the group in 2018, fretting about legal cases.</p><p>Two years later, the walls have closed in further. The Sacklers and Purdue are enmeshed in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/10/21/purdue-pharma-charges/">complex settlement negotiations</a> in cases from across the country, although they continue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/health/opoids-sacklers-purdue-testimony.html">as The New York Times reported this week</a>, to refuse “to be held personally or criminally responsible and to turn over substantial portions of their fortune.” On Thursday, they faced scathing criticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:48,&quot;bytes&quot;:71098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>In one way, the WhatsApps revealed the Sackler family to be like you and me. They had the usual group-chat issues. When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Mortimer</a> apparently wanted relatives to keep their discussions “off email” and on WhatsApp, it was tricky to get everyone on board.</p><p>“I can’t, because Marissa is the admin of the group,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Michael Sackler</a>, a film producer and founder of Rooks Nest Ventures, texted. (The messages at times only list senders’ first names, so The Ink has tried to match messages to names of family members.)</p><p>Someone else complained that their mother didn’t have WhatsApp. Marissa Sackler replied, “If she can Instagram I’m pretty sure she can master what’s app.” <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-sackler">Marissa is described on Crunchbase</a> as “continuing the family tradition of philanthropy,” having started an incubator that assists “emerging nonprofits.”</p><p>At times, their family struggles were mundane and logistical: “Hi I would love to make a dinner happen Saturday. Want to do a casual dinner with my kiddos? Or were you thinking fancy adult thing?” wrote Jeffrey Lefcourt, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/fashion/weddings/06hitchcock.html">family member</a> and <a href="https://ctrnyc.com/about/">proprietor</a> of the popular New York City restaurant brand The Smith.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2935287f-fbc5-4388-b927-518adea55695_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:48,&quot;bytes&quot;:71098,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>But as pressure against the Sacklers ratcheted up, the texts turned serious. And the reflex for managing it came naturally: let’s hit up those to whom we’ve given back.</p><p>For example, in November 2016, the Dia Art Foundation in New York had announced, according to <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/dia-art-foundation-creates-sackler-institute-focused-on-programming-research-and-education-with-generous-gift-7226/">a report in ARTnews</a>, that “following a gift from the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, it has created the Sackler Institute, which a release describes as ‘a center without walls.’” In years past, the Sacklers had given similar gifts to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/21/tate-art-galleries-will-no-longer-accept-donations-from-the-sackler-family">Tate</a> group of British galleries, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/10/v-and-a-boss-tristram-hunt-sacklers-family-funding">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/nan-goldin-leads-a-protest-at-the-guggenheim-against-the-sackler-family">the Guggenheim</a> and <a href="http://www.sackler.org/sackler-wing-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-ny/">the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/sackler-educational-laboratory">the American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York.</p><p>Well, to quote the title of <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2344-no-such-thing-as-a-free-gift">a book by Linsey McGoey</a>, there is “no such thing as a free gift.”</p><p>In late October 2017, Marissa Sackler texted the family: “I just spoke to head of communications at dia. They and many other art institutions plus bio medical schools have been reached out to by the New York Times. / Dia shares pr representation with the tate and a number of other art institutes who’ve been contacted. They are all planning to give short positive statements about us being supporters of theirs. / They expect the article to come out in the next week.”</p><p>She was wrong only about timing. On December 1, 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/arts/design/sackler-museum-donations-oxycontin-purdue-pharma.html">a report in The New York Times</a> showed how there is no silencer as effective as money. “The New York Times surveyed 21 cultural organizations listed on tax forms as having received significant sums from foundations run by two Sackler brothers who led Purdue,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinRMoynihan">Colin Moynihan</a> wrote, adding: “None indicated that they would return donations or refuse them in the future.”</p><p>Another message — sent to the group chat by <a href="https://www.tatler.com/article/sackler-scandal">Samantha Sackler Hunt</a> — suggested that emails sent by reporters to cultural institutions, asking about Sackler gifts, were being relayed back to the family, apparently via the public-relations firm Edelman:</p><blockquote><p>From Edelman</p><p>Hi all</p><p>I just wanted to keep you in the loop that a reporter from The Times (London) has also been emailing various cultural institutions that have benefitted from Sackler Family philanthropy. It seems as though she is doing a very similar exercise to the reporter from the New York Times that you have already been made aware of. Below is the request that got sent through to the V&amp;A. She appears to be sending versions of this to a number of others. From what I’ve seen so far most are responding with the same types of generic statements they gave the New York Times and all appear supportive. Georgie Keate, the reporter in question, is a general home news reporter and joined The Times in 2014 as a graduate trainee so is still relatively junior. This could indicate that it may not be a large story for them or she may be doing the spade work for someone else. We will make Josie aware.</p><p>[The reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/georgiekeate">Georgie Keate</a>’s email supposedly begins here]</p><blockquote><p><em>I am doing a story on the Sackler family and their family fortune - which derives from the extremely controversial drug Oxycontin which their company Purdue Pharma is accused of marketing falsely by claiming it was safe and non-addictive. They have faced thousands of lawsuits and paid out tens of millions over the last decade over their aggressive marketing campaigns and refusal to take responsibility for the fact the drug is dangerous. Having been held to account in America, the family continue to push it in developing countries.</em></p><p><em>Obviously, the family has donated to scores of theatres, museums and colleges across the UK while keeping their connection to Purdue and Oxycontin completely secret.</em></p><p><em>Many people who are becoming aware of this are astonished and question whether the art world should be so heavily funded by a family who have been involved in such serious wrongdoing. Some have compared it to the 100s of notables who petitioned to have BP removed from the Tate. The V&amp;A is obviously one of these beneficiaries - would you be able to comment for an article?</em></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Some months later, in March 2018, the family could continue to feel that museums were on their team. Mortimer WhatsApped the family: “Jackie spoke with the Met this morning and they are going to stand by us.”</p><p>Referring to the protests led by the artist Nan Goldin that were moving public opinion against the Sacklers, Mortimer wrote: “Better that the company use her protests as an opportunity to speak to the industry leading work they have been doing to combat prescription drug abuse. What we SHOULD do is make sure that the Guggenheim, AMNH, DIA, etc are not going to say something unhelpful. We should compile a list of organizations and decide who should speak with which.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Marissa Sackler</a> volunteered: “I speak regularly with dia on all of this and they fully support us and think Nan Goldin is crazy.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Ilene Sackler Lefcourt</a> chimed in: “I am reaching out to the AMNH through the chairman of the board’s best friend.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the following year, a growing number of institutions began to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">change their minds</a>, declaring that they would no longer take Sackler money and, in some cases, removing the Sackler name from their facilities. The institutions included the Met, the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern, the American Museum of Natural History, New York University, and Tufts.</p><p>When one of the announcements came, the first words about it in the group chat, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/meet-the-sacklers-the-family-feuding-over-blame-for-the-opioid-crisis">Sophie Sackler</a>, were: “Did anyone know this was happening?”</p><p>And alarm grew as even that most mercenary of sectors — banking — seemed to turn its back on Purdue. “Does anyone know why <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-jp-morgan-exclusive/exclusive-jpmorgan-cuts-ties-with-oxycontin-maker-purdue-pharma-sources-idUSKCN1ST2EA">JPM is not doing Purdue banking</a>?” Jeffrey Lefcourt texted the family on May 24, 2019, just days after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/met-museum-sackler-opioids.html">a wave of museum disavowals</a>, apparently referring to the banking giant J.P. Morgan Chase. “What’s their reason? Any concern they will stop doing banking for family? Have any of you spoken to them?”</p><p>Mortimer responded: “They told Purdue it was for ‘reputation’ reasons but that they were (so far) limiting it only to Purdue and not to the family.”</p><p>The timing suggests, though hardly proves, that the museums’ abrupt reversal on support for the family coincided with problems closer to the core of their business operations. Which raises the question of whether the arts institutions’ years of silence helped a machinery of death …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="fd6c">As part of the DataOps team at RealScout, I recently worked on a project to tackle infrastructure issues that plagued us for some time. We struggled with ongoing maintenance in keeping our Amazon ECS clusters up to date on the latest AMIs. Our instances, in particular, use the ECS-optimized AMIs. These AMIs include ECS container agents that are responsible for keeping instances registered and managing tasks within the cluster.</p><p id="3ab4">New AMIs are regularly released and include updated ECS container agents along with any other OS or security updates. However, the steps to upgrade instances to the latest AMI while avoiding disruptions to running tasks were extremely manual and tedious. The lack of automation hindered timely AMI updates to our EC2 instances. We observed that the more out of date agents became, the more likely they were to get disconnected. Instances would enter a zombie-like state, no longer picking up tasks.</p><p id="efc0">This resulted in major disruptions to our infrastructure that impacted our entire data ingestion pipeline. This article describes our solution to automate the AMI upgrades to our cluster without any downtime. Challenges that we encountered along the way are also addressed here.</p><p id="4416"><strong>Our Infrastructure</strong></p><p id="345f">At a high-level, our infrastructure consists of EC2 instances in an ECS cluster. The EC2 instances are part of an Auto Scaling group to maintain our required capacity. We use CloudFormation to manage and provision our AWS resources consistently across our stacks.</p><p id="8d05"><strong>Our Old Process</strong></p><p id="2672">Our old process involved a series of steps performed within the AWS console. We first created a CloudFormation change set with the new AMI and executed it. This would update the template for our stack.</p><p id="c32a">Before applying the new AMI updates to the instances themselves, we needed to ensure running tasks did not get disrupted. To do so, each ECS instance is set to a state of “DRAINING.” This prevents the instance from picking up new tasks while allowing running tasks to complete. Once the instances are completely drained, we terminate the instances. We then let the Auto Scaling Group bring up new, updated instances with the latest AMI version defined in the CloudFormation template.</p><p id="3587"><strong>Our Goal</strong></p><p id="107a">We wanted to automate, as much as possible, the task of upgrading the AMI on our cluster instances with no downtime. The system needed to replicate our manual steps to terminate and bring up new instances. All running tasks should run to completion without interruption.</p><p id="47a9">We also wanted to incorporate metrics and monitoring of the ECS cluster. We know that the latest AMI versions would also include the latest agent as well. In the past, we occasionally encountered agents getting disconnected and remaining disconnected, preventing task placements on instances. We wanted peace of mind that should this scenario creep up, it would be resolved in a timely manner.</p><p id="2b37"><strong>Our Implementation</strong></p><p id="4821">We wrote a Lambda, using the boto3 SDK with the appropriate APIs for each AWS resource. Aside from the Lambda, several other AWS resources were used:</p><ul><li id="5997">SNS — the Lambda subscribes to two SNS topics: one is an AWS defined topic where AMI updates are published. The other is an SNS topic we set up to publish our own series of events.</li><li id="abfe">CloudFormation — used to define all resources within our stack. It also defines IAM roles and permissions for each resource.</li><li id="a688">CloudWatch Event — essentially, a scheduler used to trigger our Lambda every 15 minutes, where we then perform some basic health monitoring. This includes checking whether an instance is running the latest AMI and initiates a termination if not.</li><li id="1bb7">CloudWatch Alarm — we set up an alarm to monitor CPU usage across our instances. It publishes to our SNS topic anytime CPU usage drops below 10%. We use this to determine when our instance is idle and therefore, no longer running any tasks.</li><li id="fe86">Auto Scaling Group — our EC2 instances are part of an auto scaling group. The auto scaling group is responsible for maintaining our required capacity. It automatically provisions new instances as needed to meet capacity.</li><li id="0448">LifeCycle Hooks — as its name implies, these allow us to hook into the lifecycle of an EC2 instance. It lets us pause a termination event and run some custom actions before resume termination.</li></ul><p id="fbef">High-level descriptions along with some code snippets are provided below to describe the three main functions of the Lambda.</p><p id="d81f">1) When a new AMI is available, we update our CloudFormation template to include the new version. We subscribe to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS-AMI-SubscribeTopic.html" rel="noopener">Amazon ECS-optimized AMI</a> topic to receive update notifications. Once our Lambda receives an event that a new AMI is published, it creates and executes a change set for our CloudFormation template. We notify our team of the new AMI and when the change set gets executed via DataDog and Slack integrations. At this point, the only actual change is only to our CloudFormation template. We do not apply the change to the instances yet.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3108/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png" width="1554" height="422" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*F0wPMc_1Ijtb5FMU05A0bw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Updating CloudFormation template with new AMI</figcaption></figure><p id="1b15">2) Our next step performs a couple of health checks. We configure a CloudWatch event that runs every 15 minutes to check for any EC2 instances with disconnected agents. Since it is possible for agents to periodically get disconnected for various reasons and reconnect on their own, we implemented a check to detect agents disconnected for longer than 30 minutes. Instances disconnected for longer than our grace period are terminated. The auto scaling group then brings up a new, healthy instance. This does rely on some higher-level architecture to reschedule any ECS tasks that are killed as a result of this, so consider that for your own setup.</p><p id="ccfd">The second health check verifies if all instances are running on the latest AMI as specified in our CloudFormation template. Since we immediately update our template when a new AMI is published, our scheduled health check detects any instances not on the AMI within a 15 minute interval at most. To kick off this chain of events, we simply terminate the out-of-date instances, and again, rely on the auto scaling group to bring up new instances containing the latest AMI.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1682/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png" width="841" height="240" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*VbksgDN871WDKXTWIAl0_g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Check for outdated instance AMIs and agent health</figcaption></figure><p id="3088">3) The final step is where the bulk of the work is in our Lambda. The importance here, however, is that we ensure instances are gracefully terminated. A lifecycle hook plays a major part in doing so. We set up a life cycle hook that subscribes to an SNS event when an instance is terminating. The hook allows us to pause the termination and perform a series of actions before completing the instance terminations.</p><p id="31bb">Once a termination is detected, we set the status of each instance to DRAINING. We then re-publish an event to request termination again for the instance. This new termination request event will trigger our Lambda again. This time, we check for any running tasks on instances marked as DRAINING.</p><p id="3220">For any instances that are still draining, we set a CloudWatch alarm to check when the instance becomes idle, indicating it is no longer running any tasks. This is slightly different than similar implementations where an event is re-published (i.e, continues to loop) to check for running tasks. This introduces an additional AWS resource to the layer. Since we occasionally have some very long running tasks (e.g, 12 hours), we decided to go with using an alarm to detect CPU usage to determine when the instance was likely drained. If the CPU usage on an instance drops to less than 10%, the CloudWatch alarm triggers an event, where we then check again if all tasks are complete. This approach cut out wasteful, continuous looping for very long running tasks.</p><pre><span id="869f">cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(<br> AlarmName=f"Check_Idle_{instance['ec2InstanceId']}",<br> AlarmDescription='Instance pending termination appears idle (&lt;= 10%)',<br> AlarmActions=[topic_arn],<br> MetricName='CPUUtilization',<br> Namespace='AWS/EC2',<br> Statistic='Average',<br> Dimensions=[{'Name': 'InstanceId', 'Value': instance['ec2InstanceId']}],<br> Period=60, # seconds<br> EvaluationPeriods=1,<br> Threshold=10,<br> ComparisonOperator='LessThanOrEqualToThreshold',<br> TreatMissingData='breaching'<br>)</span></pre><p id="0bfe">Once instances no longer have running tasks, we allow the termination to complete:</p><pre><span id="ba48">asg.complete_lifecycle_action(<br> LifecycleHookName=msg['LifecycleHookName'],<br> AutoScalingGroupName=msg['AutoScalingGroupName'],<br> LifecycleActionResult='CONTINUE',<br> InstanceId=instance['ec2InstanceId'])</span></pre><p id="dc64">Our implementation was influenced by AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatically-update-instances-in-an-amazon-ecs-cluster-using-the-ami-id-parameter" rel="noopener">example</a> implementation. The main tweak we made was using CloudWatch alarms to notify when an instance has completed all running tasks.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3680/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png" width="1840" height="762" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*aLUt_mnySqq087XIXLipLg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Using a lifecycle hook to gracefully terminate instances</figcaption></figure><p id="08aa"><strong>Challenges along the way</strong></p><p id="8a4e">One of the biggest challenges was the various AWS resources needed (on top of our existing AWS resources) to fully automate the instance upgrades. The complexity of configuring each component in the CloudFormation templates, along with proper IAM roles and permissions was a big task. Wading through the AWS documentation and understanding how to hook up the APIs to communicate with each resource was also a big undertaking. Through a bit of trial and error, we were able to get all pieces working together.</p><p id="4686"><strong>Results</strong></p><p id="b9ef">Since our implementation, we have observed that new Optimized ECS AMIs are generally released about two or three times a month. For us, it is a great feeling each time to see a Slack notification alerting our team of a new AMI quickly followed by a notification of the AMI update to our CloudFormation template. The template update itself occurs within 2 minutes of a newly published AMI. And from there, the rolling upgrade gets initiated in less than 15 minutes, making us very happy campers! On top of that, the additional scheduled monitoring gives us confidence that our container agents are healthy and connected as expected. Needless to say, our efforts were rewarded with a much more resilient system and time saved cumulatively each month!</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>13</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s not a clickbait title, but I understand why it looks that way.</p>



<p>I’ve made my thoughts about the 10x developer trope <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/06/listening-7-deliberate-appreciation/">extremely clear</a>. I think that someone who produces 10x as much code as someone else has left a wake of destruction that will slow down other developers. I don’t think 10x counts if you achieve it by slowing down everyone else. I think 10x has to take into account how you impact other people.</p>



<p>And <em>that,</em> paradoxically, suggests a path for how to become a 10x developer: empower and enable other people such that nine additional developers’ worth of work gets done. You can do that by making nine other developers’ workflows 2x smoother. You can also do that by making 18 other developers’ workflows 50% smoother, or 90 other developers’ workflows 10% smoother.</p>

<p>At some point, your biggest gains in your X are gonna be in improving the ecosystem for other developers. On occasions when I have succeeded at that, from <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">driving workplace changes</a> to <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/category/teaching/">teaching computer science classes</a>, I have noticed that I’m using one or more of three techniques. So I thought I’d list them here.</p>



<h3>First, establish the motivation.</h3>



<p>Learning is work. Sometimes, it’s boring or difficult work. Folks don’t undertake that kind of work unless they understand why they should. That’s not as simple as <em>telling</em> them why. Understanding comes from engaging with the material.</p>



<p>Suppose you want to make a major code change that affects your team’s workflow. If you blaze forward and do that without buy-in, the team will resent it (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">as we’ve discussed in more detail here</a>). So I recommend starting with individual conversations about the reasons for the change:</p>



<blockquote><p><span>What is bothering you about your team’s current workflow that motivates you to push your solution? Are you annoyed at having to write the same code over and over in different places? Are you tired of trying to poke your way around an opaque tool? Are you losing track of things that cost you time and money? Before you&nbsp;</span><em>push</em><span>&nbsp;your solution,&nbsp;</span><em>pull</em><span>&nbsp;your coworkers to it by making sure they feel the pain that you feel.</span></p><p>Before I do a major refactor, I’ll deliberately pair program with key people on my team on the kind of problems that my refactor would solve. I want them to experience the pain firsthand; I want to hear them say ‘oh my&nbsp;<em>god&nbsp;</em>this is annoying.’ After I have that admission of pain from a critical mass of people on my team, I’ll propose my solution, and I’ll offer to spearhead the refactor. I will craft a concise explanation of how our workflow changes after the refactor, and I’ll point out why I think the new way is nicer for us than the way we’re doing it now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ‘negative testimonials’ about the old way, which I can whip out to capture the attention and agreement of others on my team. This approach allows me to muster support for my refactor and then, in spearheading the refactor, look like I’m taking one for the team.</p><p>Imagine the same scenario, same refactor, but instead of socializing my solution, I go off on my own, do the refactor, and push. My team didn’t understand the pain that the refactor solved, so all they’re seeing is the pain of learning the&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;way to do things. To them, it looks like I made a unilateral decision that screwed them over—the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;of what a team player would do. Keep in mind, in both circumstances, I wrote the&nbsp;<em>same code</em>. The only difference is how I introduced it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, even the right code changes need to be <em>sold</em>. </p>



<p>How do we know what the right code changes are? This one is tricky, but one guiding principle has helped me out a lot:</p>



<h3>Look for bonehead solutions to convoluted technical issues.</h3>



<p>Michael Feathers talks a great deal about technical simplification options in his various discussions on edge-free programming (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">here’s a more detailed look at some of those principles)</a>. But for exemplary purposes, here are a few simple solutions to complex problems that I’m especially proud of:</p>



<ul><li>I solved a thorny issue with a sometimes camouflaged, sometimes unreliable delete button by ripping it out (<a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/pull/345">Here’s the PR if you want more details</a>)</li><li>I resolved the issue of a laggy metronome in React-Native, where computationally expensive operations can result in delays for scheduled tasks. The app happened to also need to play back tracks at various multiples of their original speed. So I recorded a sound file of a metronome at 120 BPM, calculated what speed to play it by dividing the BPM the musician requested by 120, and wrote one method that shelled out to <code>expo-av</code> to play accurate-to-tempo sound files for both the metronome and the backtracks.</li><li>I resolved an issue of regulating how often a person should be allowed to log their mood by realizing the issue was fake (assumed foil to “let’s make sure they log it at least this often”) and letting them log as often as they want (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">more details here</a>).</li></ul>



<p>Each of these solutions made the code cleaner and eliminated<em> </em>multiple problems with the product. But they were not genius solutions. In fact, they were easy to miss precisely because complex problems don’t scream “I have a bonehead solution.”</p>


	
	


<p><strong>One drawback: </strong>the tech industry generally rewards churning out tons of code <em>over</em> elegant solutions. Chen Lin recently <a href="https://twitter.com/votecapgood/status/1337920511095918592">tweeted about</a> his experience with this at Uber. Chen is responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1337552024821510144">this commentary</a>, which starts out salty but goes on to articulate a rarely-discussed element of how the tech industry functions: tech executives <em>have</em> to make their work appear innovative in order to secure VC funding. So they’re forced to artificially “make it innovative” by filing patents or hopping on the latest trends. In the case of Uber and iOS development, that imperative <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">burned them badly</a>.</p>



<p>Academia is similar: <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/watt-jeremy.html">Dr. Jeremy Watt</a>, author of <em><a href="https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined">Machine Learning Refined</a></em>, articulates how academics <em>have</em> to make their work appear novel in order to get published, and they have to get published to keep their jobs, so they’re forced to artificially differentiate similar concepts—to convolute rather than simplify.</p>



<p>There’s a great <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120">explanation from Mekka Okereke</a> about how to counteract some of this as an engineer. It shares a lot with our “first establish the motivation” approach—namely, by starting from the <em>problem</em>, not the solution.</p>



<p><strong>Also, a giant caveat: </strong>This solution is not always there. Sometimes the solution just has to be clever, or complicated, or messy. Sadly I can’t give you an ironclad heuristic for how to find them or how to confirm their existence. I can tell you this: in most cases where I have found them, I have found them by popping <em>up</em> a level from the implementation level to the design level. </p>



<p>Also, this recommendation applies specifically to technical solutions: it does not apply, for example, to racism or fascism. The problems we’re talking about here are de facto circumscribed by the scope of an application. When we’re talking about a generational cultural, political, and structural phenomenon, “just rip out X” doesn’t work.</p>

										<figcaption>Nor does one simply solve [insert insidious social issue here].</figcaption>
					</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>White supremacy culture in tech alone is so insidious and multifaceted that I’ve got <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/02/07/the-price-of-whiteness-in-tech/">an ongoing series</a> about reimagining different parts of tech through a not-white-supremacist lens. But also, listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1249908489826099201">Marco Rogers about this caveat</a>. He knows more things than I do.</p>



<p>ANYWAY, anyway, anyway. </p>



<p>So we’ve talked about selling our changes, and we’ve talked about making changes that reduce the scope of complexity. Naturally, the third thing I find myself doing, is selling new knowledge <em>by</em> reducing the scope of complexity. Here we go:</p>



<h3>Try to spread intuition with as few prerequisites as possible.</h3>



<p>One of my Mobile Software Development students asked me what frameworks he should consider for testing a Python app he’s working on. Here’s what I said:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>In Python there are two leading options: unittest and pytest. Both work fine. When I’m working on teams, I tend to go with pytest because the output is a little nicer.&nbsp;</p><p>But…when I’m&nbsp;<em>teaching</em>&nbsp;Python, I don’t use a testing framework at all. I write methods that call the method I’m testing, and then I use Python’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp" target="_blank">built in assert keyword</a>&nbsp;to check the state of the modified objects or return values. Reason being, I don’t want to jump into the complexity of all the different stuff you can use to test until students understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we test. I try to use the minimum toolset that gets the point across.</p></div></blockquote>



<p><br>One of the big things that educational approaches manage to screw up, in my view, is to introduce prerequisites that make the topic in question <em>harder</em> instead of <em>easier</em>. Fluent Forever founder Gabriel Wyner <a href="https://youtu.be/bPVeIHcgfTs?t=74">articulates how language learning often depends on translation</a>—which is a whole, separate, <em>difficult</em> skill. So when I’m trying to help someone build intuition, I’ll try to eliminate as many dependencies as possible. </p>



<p>I’ll show you an example for teaching testing in Python. I pulled this example out of a notebook that I share with my <a href="https://www.emergentworks.org/">Emergent Works</a> and <a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode">Justice Through Code</a> mentee. She was working on writing a Sudoku solver. Of course, to solve a Sudoku, it helps to know when a Sudoku is solved. </p>



<p>Suppose we start with a similar but simpler puzzle; each row and each column must each possess one copy of each number, like this:</p>



<pre><code>puzzle = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 4, 3],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
]</code></pre>



<p>This is a valid puzzle, albeit smaller than your typical 9 x 9. </p>



<p>It shows a way of <em>representing</em> our problem space—a list of lists. We could make a <code>Puzzle </code>class for this, with all kinds of methods on it. I’m not doing that yet. I’m doing the <em>minimum thing</em> that gets the point across: we need a way to represent our data. Here is a way to represent our data with minimal dependencies and indirection. </p>



<p>We’re gonna do the same thing for the test, no test framework involved (yet!):</p>



<pre><code>def valid_puzzle(puzzle):
    try: 
        # Python is duck-typed, so …</code></pre></div></div>

          <h2>Shiny new things</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pasting HTML content will now be automatically converted to Markdown. Same for drag and drop. For example, links you drag from web pages will now generate <code>[Display text](https://url)</code> instead of previously just the URL.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creating new notes from the file explorer or using the hotkey now always open in edit mode.</li>
<li>When setting up sync on a vault that’s older than the synced remote vault, the older files will be ignored and overwritten to avoid a mass rollback.</li>
<li>Navigation history has been slightly tweaked to be more intuitive, and also remembers scroll sync properly.</li>
<li>On macOS, closing the last vault and re-activating Obsidian will now re-open the last vault instead of opening the vault switcher.</li>
</ul>
<h2>No longer broken</h2>
<ul>
<li>On macOS, quitting and restarting the app will properly restore the opened vaults.</li>
<li>Translucency should now work again on app start on macOS.</li>
<li>Drag and drop a file to open in a pane will now properly push the navigation history so going backwards feels more natural.</li>
<li>Spellchecker will now split words that are adjacent to CJK characters.</li>
<li>The “explain search term” button now works properly again.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content"><p><code>jq</code> is a command line tool for parsing and modifying JSON. It is useful for extracting relevant bits of information from tools that output JSON, or REST APIs that return JSON. Mac users can install <code>jq</code> using homebrew (<code>brew install jq</code>); see <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/">here</a> for more install options.</p>
<p>In this post we'll examine a couple "real world" examples of using <code>jq</code>, but let's start with...</p>
<h2 id="-code-jq-code-basics">
    <a href="#-code-jq-code-basics">
      
    </a>
    <code>jq</code> Basics</h2><p>The most basic use is just tidying &amp; pretty-printing your JSON:</p>
<pre><code>$ USERX=<span>'{"name":"duchess","city":"Toronto","orders":[{"id":"x","qty":10},{"id":"y","qty":15}]}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"city"</span>: <span>"Toronto"</span>,
  <span>"orders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>10</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>15</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>I like this pretty-printing/formatting capability so much, I have an alias that formats JSON I've copied (in my OS "clipboard") &amp; puts it back in my clipboard:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> jsontidy=<span>"pbpaste | jq '.' | pbcopy"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'.'</code> in the <code>jq '.'</code> command above is the simplest jq "filter." The dot takes the input JSON and outputs it as is. You can read more about filters <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters">here</a>, but the bare minimum to know is that <code>.keyname</code> will filter the result to a property matching that key, and <code>[index]</code> will match an array value at that index:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.name'</span>
<span>"duchess"</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 10
}
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>[]</code> will match <em>each</em> item in an array:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[].id'</span>
<span>"x"</span>
<span>"y"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Filtering output by value is also handy! Here we use <code>|</code> to output the result of one filter into the input of another filter and <code>select(.qty&gt;10)</code> to select only orders with <code>qty</code> value greater than 10:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[]|select(.qty&gt;10)'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 15
}
</code></pre>
<p>One more trick: filtering by <strong>key</strong> name rather than value:</p>
<pre><code>$ ORDER=<span>'{"user_id":123,"user_name":"duchess","order_id":456,"order_status":"sent","vendor_id":789,"vendor_name":"Abe Books"}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
{
  <span>"user_id"</span>: 123,
  <span>"user_name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>,
  <span>"vendor_id"</span>: 789,
  <span>"vendor_name"</span>: <span>"Abe Books"</span>
}
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'with_entries(select(.key|match("order_")))'</span>
{
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>(cheat sheet version: <code>with_entries(select(.key|match("KEY FILTER VALUE")))</code>)</p>

    </a>
    A Usecase: Debugging Some Prometheus Metrics</h2><p>I have a prometheus metric showing up locally that doesn't look quite right:</p>
<pre><code>async_task_total{task_name="/Users/duchess/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/web/page/globals.go(189):(*GlobalsPopulator).Populate"} 6
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that the <code>task_name</code> value is a <em>filename</em> is a red flag–<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels">it's bad to have labels with high cardinality</a> and I'm not sure how many of these there are. I want to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do these <code>task_name</code> labels look like in production?</li>
<li>How many unique values are there for these labels?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
    <a href="#1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
      
    </a>
    1. Getting the label values in production</h3><p>At my company there is a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tool we'll call <code>pquery</code> that allows prometheus metrics to be queried from the command line, and it outputs JSON–how conventient! I use this tool in the following examples. You don't have this tool, but fear not: <a href="https://learndevops.substack.com/p/hitting-prometheus-api-with-curl">this wonderful post</a> explains how to query prometheus using <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> which is essentially what <code>pquery</code> does.</p>
<p>Using <code>pquery</code> we can view prometheus metrics from our various clusters. But even if we filter for this exact metric name, it's more data than we can easily look at. We'll use <code>wc -l</code> (wordcount: count lines) to get a rough idea of how much data we're working with:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | wc <span>-l</span>
316117
</code></pre>
<p>316,117 lines of JSON! Oof! We want to iterate over the metrics. But what jq filter do we need to access the array of metrics? I find <code>head</code> useful for figuring out what the top level keys are for a large json structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | head -n 20
{
    <span>"data"</span>: {
        <span>"result"</span>: [
            {
                <span>"metric"</span>: {
                    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
                    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
                    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
                    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
                    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
                    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
                },
                <span>"value"</span>: [
                    1600981630.344,
                    <span>"2"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>jq 'keys'</code> if you just want the key names:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'keys'</span>
[
  <span>"data"</span>,
  <span>"status"</span>
]
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway we can see from above that <code>.data.result</code> is the "filter" path for the metrics themselves. Let's get the <strong>first result</strong> (<code>[0]</code>) of this array so we can see what one metric looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'.data.result[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"metric"</span>: {
    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
  },
  <span>"value"</span>: [
    1600981906.069,
    <span>"2"</span>
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Oops! That <code>app</code> value (<code>toodle-app-alpha</code>) indicates a mistake: I'm only interested in results from the <code>toodle-app</code> app, <em>not</em> from other apps that may also emit this metric (such as the <code>alpha</code> deployment we see here). We could <code>select</code> for this using jq, but <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/"><code>promql</code> already lets us filter by metric names</a> so we'll do that instead: <code>pquery 'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</code>.</p>
<p>We're interested in the <code>task_name</code> value in the <code>metric</code> object, so let's pluck that from <strong>each</strong> item in the array above:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</span> \
| jq <span>'.data.result[].metric.task_name'</span>

<p>📝 Update: It was pointed out to me that as this is a post about <code>jq</code>, not about <code>promql</code>, a <code>jq</code> solution is more appropriate here. I'd originally used promql because it's more efficient to filter on the server when possible. Here's the <code>jq</code> version which uses the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#select(boolean_expression)"><code>select</code> filter</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> \

          <p>
We're pretty deep into the whole COVID thing. Where I am in the world, we've been in some variation of lockdown for nine months now. It has meant a lot of changes to my working life, but one of the larger changes to my workflow is that there's no longer a giant whiteboard mounted directly behind me. "Diagrams as code" tools such as <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a> have gone some way towards filling the void, and I'll examine how far they go in helping me communicate software architecture.
<span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">Why did I like the whiteboard so much?&nbsp;<a href="#why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much" aria-label="Anchor Link For: why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">
    
</a></h2>
<p>I think the main thing here is the speed of iteration. When scribbling out an architectural idea, there's usually a bit of back and forth. As long as the diagram is on the whiteboard still, it's easy to erase a few lines here and there and add a few elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the drag and drop functionalities of tools such as <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">LucidChart</a> or <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a> can work for this. With that said, I've suffered the indignity of a stray arrow magnetising itself to the wrong box. It's not the worst thing to happen, nor the hardest thing to fix, but I felt I could go faster. </p>
<h2 id="heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">Heaping praise on diagrams as code<a href="#heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code" aria-label="Anchor Link For: heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Being able to delegate how the diagram looks to something else is a boon for my productivity. I know that I can smash out a diagram in Mermaid syntax and the diagram will look pretty good. Don't get me wrong - no graphics design awards are coming my way, but by and large, the diagram is correct and looks clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a simple example that I wrote with Mermaid. Take the following scenario. Service A schedules a task to run at some point with an external service - think of some kind of process that can't be immediately actioned, such as a scheduled task. We're immediately told whether task scheduling worked. If all goes well, the job is eventually delegated to a worker, which carries out it's assigned task. Once that's done, the worker dispatches a webhook notification to service B, allowing us to do whatever further processing logic we need to. Now, I want to describe that using Mermaid syntax. This is what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>sequenceDiagram  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service A  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service Worker  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service B  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service A -&gt;&gt;+ External Service: createJob(notifyEndpoint, jobParameters)

<p>And that produces a diagram that looks something like this<sup><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> :</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/practices/fill-void-physical-whiteboard/mermaid-diagram-20201218194918.png" alt="Visual Diagram for the above Mermaid Sequence Diagram code"></p>
<p>The sequence diagram allows me to express this chain of events tersely in code, but richly in the diagram. I'm able to quick and easily represent operational quirks. For instance, the initialisation of job processing is asynchronous. It doesn't occur immediately, but at some unspecified time in the future. In the diagram, I can express that with a dashed line, and in the code for the diagram, that's as easy as <code>--&gt;&gt;+</code>. Sequence numbers make it easy for me to discuss the diagram with other people, as we can refer to steps by their number. And to add them in was as easy as including a parameter when generating the diagram:&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code><span>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"theme"</span><span>: </span><span>"default"</span><span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"sequence"</span><span>: {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"showSequenceNumbers"</span><span>: </span><span>true&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now all the example is perhaps not the most powerful use case. It's a little simple, and it's not tricky to put together a diagram that looks like this with a GUI. In reality these diagrams have a fair bit more going on.</p>
<p>But putting it together in code feels a lot faster for me. The diagram is unsullied by my clumsiness at getting arrows to magnetise to the right box in a WSYWIG web GUI. And this whole thing took me two or three minutes to write - I spent more time coming up with the scenario. I can take the generated image and put it in a ticket, or a slack message, and use it as a visual aid for communicating my thought processes.&nbsp;Even though architectures are more complex in reality, I don't feel like a sense of not being able to express them using these tools.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that I'm more likely to be able to evolve this diagram over time. It doesn't rely on me preserving a whiteboard for all eternity. I can come back later, and make a quick tweak or edit, based on feedback or what have you. I write code every day, so as a method of building something - I'm used to it. Should I make a mistake, or if I want to make some tweak somewhere, I can do that without much fuss. I could even commit these into source control if I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to construct diagrams whilst sustaining speed, correctness and clarity are pretty much all I need. If I want to make a particularly pretty diagram (maybe it's for external eyes) I'd use the drag and drop tools. The more complex autogenerated diagrams tend to have a few visual quirks. But where I want the diagram to be evolvable, these tools fill the niche well. The hosted services that provide diagramming as a service see the value in these tools. For example, LucidChart supports its own flavour of syntax, and Draw.IO supports PlantUML and Mermaid syntax.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">But does it replace a whiteboard?<a href="#but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard" aria-label="Anchor Link For: but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Ish. Scribbling on a whiteboard feels faster still - at least for initial construction. And the back and forth with people when etching on a board feels easier.</p>
<p>But, I've gotten faster generating diagrams from code. The syntax for mermaid and PlantUML is pretty simple and easy to remember after a spot of practice. And in a way, it feels accessible in a different way to a whiteboard. We don't have to be in the same room to collaborate. The escape hatch here is that we can always switch to using the WSYWIG to construct the diagram instead. It's slower, but if someone's not up to speed with the syntax and it's not worth them getting up to speed, it's an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond that, it lets me get a head start on any artefacts we need for documentation. Producing a quick diagram in the planning phases of a ticket that I can evolve later into something more formal is a big win for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Constructing diagrams as code does not replace everything a whiteboard does for me. But it's fast enough, it's easy to get started, and it makes it easy to involve remote people. If everyone knows the syntax, remote collaboration is easy, and you've still got the escape hatch of WSYWIG tools, though they feel slower to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that a quick sequence diagram, to help communicate a mental model of a solution can grease the wheels of progress a great deal.</p>

In the computer vision landscape today there are many custom object detectors that recognize objects from farm animals to phone defects. </p><h3 id="the-coco-dataset">The COCO Dataset</h3><p><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/coco-dataset/">The COCO dataset</a> is the gold standard benchmark for evaluating object detection models. The COCO (<a href="https://roboflow.com/formats/coco-json">Common Objects in COntext</a>) dataset contains over 120,000 images for training and testing, with 80 object class labels that are commonly observed in everyday life. Generally, if a model does well on the COCO dataset, it is believed that the model will generalize well to new custom domains - in the spirit of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242">YOLO9000</a>, for 9000 objects.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 617w"><figcaption>Detecting the many objects in the world in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf">the original YOLO9000 model</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="efficientdet-models-model-scaling">EfficientDet Models - Model Scaling</h3><p>The <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/breaking-down-efficientdet/">EfficientDet</a> family of models has been the preferred object detection models since it was published by the Google Research/Brain team in recent months. The most novel contribution in the EfficientDet paper was to think strategically about how to scale object detection models up and down. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/model_scaling.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/model_scaling.png 688w"><figcaption>Model scaling in EfficientDet (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Object detection models can be scaled by using a large image input resolution, scaling the width of the convolutional network layer, scaling the depth of convolutional layers, and scaling all of these things together. The EfficientDet authors use search to find an optimal scaling threshold from EfficientDet-D0 to EfficientDet-D1, and use this setting to linearly scale up to the famed EfficientDet-D7.</p><h3 id="yolo-models">YOLO Models</h3><p>The YOLO family of models, written in the Darknet framework, has a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">rich history</a> starting with Joseph Redmon (Github moniker <a href="https://pjreddie.com/">pjreddie</a>). Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>. The network, written in <a href="https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/">the Paddle-Paddle framework</a>, performed well but has yet to gain much traction among practitioners.</p><p><strong>But all of that's old news:</strong> Scaled-YOLOv4 is here and YOLOv4 has been fully <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929.pdf">CSP-ized</a>!</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-techniques">Scaled-YOLOv4 Techniques</h2><p>To scale the YOLOv4 model, the Scaled-YOLOv4 authors explore the following strategies.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1376w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A visualization of the YOLO network, courtesy of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12099.pdf">PP-YOLO</a>.

They consider a few CSP-ized CNN backbones in their network, ResNet, ResNeXt, and the traditional Darknet backbone.</p><h3 id="csp-izing">"CSP-izing"</h3><p>In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08036">Scaled-YOLOv4</a> paper the authors often write that they "CSP-ized" a given portion of the network. To CSP-ize means to apply the concepts laid out in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11929">Cross-Stage Partial Networks</a> paper, written by <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu">WongKinYiu</a>. The CSP is a new way to architect convolutional neural networks that saves on computation for various CNN networks - up to 50% (for the Darknet backbone in FLOPs).</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-tiny-model">Scaling the YOLOv4-tiny model</h3><p>The YOLOv4-tiny model had different considerations than the Scaled-YOLOv4 model because, on the edge, different constraints come into play, like memory bandwidth and memory access. For the YOLOv4-tiny's shallow CNN, the authors look to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">OSANet</a> for its favorable computational complexity at little depth.</p><h3 id="scaling-the-yolov4-csp-models">Scaling the YOLOv4-CSP models </h3><p>To detect large objects in large images, the authors find that it is important to increase the depth and number of stages in in the CNN backbone and neck. (Increasing the width reportedly has little effect.) This allows them to first scale up input size and number of stages, and dynamically adjust width and depth according to realtime inference speed requirements. In addition to these scaling factors, the authors also adjust the configuration of their model's architecture in the paper.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png 695w"><figcaption>YOLOv4-P5/P6/P7 architectures (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-augmentations">Data Augmentations</h3><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-yolov4-c16bd22b2617">Data augmentation in YOLOv4</a> was one of the key contributions to YOLOv4's impressive performance. In Scaled-YOLOv4, the authors train on a less augmented dataset first, then turn up the augmentations for fine-tuning at the end of training. They also use "Test Time Augmentations," where a number of augmentations are made on the test set. Predictions are then averaged across those test augmentations to further boost their non-real time results. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="scaled-yolov4-results">Scaled-YOLOv4 Results</h2><p>Evaluations show that the Scaled-YOLOv4 models set the standard for both large and small object detection models.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 650w"><figcaption>Scaled-YOLOv4 results, inference speed on the X-axis and COCO average precision on the Y-axis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The language in the Scaled-YOLOv4 paper speaks for itself:</p><blockquote>We can see that all scaled YOLOv4 models, including YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv4-P5, YOLOv4-P6, YOLOv4- P7, are Pareto optimal on all indicators. When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%). In both cases, YOLOv4-P6 and YOLOv4-P7 are, respectively, 3.7 times and 2.3 times faster in terms of inference speed. </blockquote><p>And notably for YOLOv4-tiny:</p><blockquote>In addition, if one uses TensorRT FP16 to run YOLOv4-tiny on general GPU RTX 2080ti, when the batch size respectively equals to 1 and 4, the respective frame rate can reach 773fps and 1774fps, which is extremely fast.</blockquote><p><strong>If you want to push the ceiling for performance or speed for your object detection task, Scaled-YOLOv4 is the new place to look.</strong></p><p>The authors provide myriad ablation studies and many more research insights than we have written here.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I’m running through Lands End. It’s 8AM on a winter day. Cool mist hangs in the air, and the gravel crunches under my running shoes. I’m looking at my Apple Watch, checking the time as I run down the hill, past the Cliff House, looking at the Pacific as it shines in the morning sun like a pool of liquid silver stretching to the horizon. California is good. I hear the waves crashing, and the air softly smells of salt and pines. To my left, I see the Pacific Towers: eight fifty-five story glass obelisks stretching into the sky, all connected by a public park up top, six hundred feet in the air. A marvel of modern engineering, only paralleled by a few buildings in Shanghai. The year is 2030. I’m fortunate to rent a one-bedroom in the Pacific Towers for $2700 a month. I live on the fourteenth floor.</p> <p>I shower while Siri reads me my emails. “Archive, archive, skip, schedule for 10AM”: speech recognition lets me take care of a full night of notifications. Though my executive and product leaders are in San Francisco, my company otherwise runs on a 24/7 global team, so work accumulates throughout the night.</p> <p>I step out of the shower. My bathroom’s ceiling fans all immediately point hot air at me to help me dry off faster. (It’s cozy, too.) I’m rubbing my hair with a towel when soft ringing emanates throughout the apartment. “Who is it?” I ask. “It’s Jess Bergman” Siri replies. Six hundred speakers and microphones hidden in the walls throughout my 900 square feet make it feel remarkably natural to talk to my virtual assistant.</p> <p>“Pick up”. Jess is on the phone. She’s telling me that one of our customers, an oil-shipping company, suffered some kind of bizarre bug where we dispatched one of their tankers without filling it entirely. It’s a costly error – $8M in oil that’s left sitting somewhere. Jess and I suspect some of the customer’s tanker sensors are defective, and we line up a diagnostic team to take a look. We sell logistical optimization software.</p> <p>I’m heading down the elevator to the Pacific Towers to the underground BAMF stop. BAMF was the 2022 successor to BART – everyone recognized “Bay Area Rapid Transit” as a hilarious oxymoron, an embarrassment compared to our global peers, so our local government and industry leaders created Bay Area Mega Fast: an autonomous metro system modeled after the Hong Kong and Tokyo subways – just twice as fast. Trains arrive every 30 seconds, and I’ll be at my office in the Tenderloin in exactly 114 seconds.</p> <p>There’s only one stop in-between. I’m proud to say that my company helped design some of the BAMF network for optimal throughput – like all Bay Area projects, it’s a public-private partnership, and the government brought in the best logistical optimizers from industry. Even eight years ago, I’m flattered to say that was us. We’re better now, but we still have a long way to go.</p> <p>I’m wearing my Raycasters inside the BAMF train. They’re one brand of many smart glasses that overlay useful information on my field of vision. I usually turn off the auto-recognize, subtitles, and maps, but keep on my vital sign displays. The data is beamed straight from my apple watch. Eyeball control makes it super easy to navigate the interface. It seems that my blood sugar is a little low. I flick through the suggestions. “Eat a quarter of a Snickers bar”, it says. Great, I’ve got some at the office.</p> <p>I’m out the BAMF and straight up the elevator. My company has half the 85th floor of the Civic Spiral. The building is a glass tornado. It was completed two years ago, and it’s the tallest office building in the world. Rent here is unbelievably expensive – nearly $200 per square foot per year. But it’s a good splurge.</p> <p>I have a meeting to talk about the status on the oil shipping bug and get a little more clarity. I’m chatting with the team in Dubai, and my EARS2 earphones do real-time translation from Arabic to English. It’s amazing. The EARS2 founder is a buddy of mine, his office is just the floor below. He’s got an unbelievable view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Alcatraz International Airport, where Elon Musk’s grasshopper rockets land and take off all day, sending San Francisco residents around the globe at Mach 2 for lunch meetings. I think it’s extravagant, but to each their own.</p> <p>I step out for lunch with Sam Fultzmann. He’s the craziest guy I know, which is why I love having lunch with him. We step outside the Civic Spiral and grab little electric longboards to scoot to our favorite Shawarma shop. The longboards recognize me by RFID sensor and automatically bill my Stripe bank account, accurately to the millionth of a dollar. We arrive at Bilal’s Bar and Grill on Market Street. The line for seating is forever long. The GDP of the Tenderloin is nearly a trillion dollars now, but some things just don’t change. We register ourselves for a seating spot with a watch tap, and go for a walk under the trees while we wait. San Francisco got a lot greener after human-driven cars were banned in 2023. The streets were narrowed since autonomous vehicles and personal things like bicycles and skateboards just needed much less space. The fact that just seven years ago, people were driving around twenty-foot-long trucks <em>for just themselves</em> that they left parked 92% of the time is so crazy that I can hardly fathom it.</p> <p>Even though it’s winter, it’s pretty warm outside. There isn’t a building <em>under</em> 300 feet around me, it’s glass and concrete as far as the eye can see. That makes it a little warmer on the ground, but the trees help, and there’s a Fremont company experimenting with upper-stratosphere reflective seeding to mitigate global warming, which is the overarching culprit here. I’m due to stop by there later today, actually.</p> <p>Over lunch, Sam tells me that he angel invested in Telomize, a Palo Alto company that does telomere lengthening for anti-aging. (Everyone’s an angel investor now that there’s an income tax break if you invest your income in early-stage companies.) We haven’t cracked the aging nut yet, but we’re close. I quiz Sam about the prospects of the company, and he admits that he invested just to get early access to their product. He’s on it right now. I joke that it could be harmful, but Sam doesn’t care: whatever, there’s no regulatory body that can stop him from experimenting with novel treatments. He has an 8G feed continuously streaming 200 GB a second of vital sign data back to Telomize company to track the effectiveness and safety of the treatment. There are 35,000 other crazies like him, and between the lot of them they’re constructing a pretty good medical study in real time.</p> <p>I tell Sam about the oil problem. He tells me he read a book the other day about Rockefeller and the Oil Magnates of the turn of the 20th century: “did you know that Cleveland, Ohio used to be the wealthiest city in the United States?” he bursts out, guffawing. “Cleveland? These guys don’t even have a space program”, I laugh. (The Bay Area has three now, all private enterprise with some public backing.)</p> <p>“What happened?” I ask Sam. “Well, jeez, it’s like Cleveland just sort of found itself in the middle of an oil boom, geographically. One year they were like any other second-tier industrializing city, and then they suddenly had this huge influx of wealth and enterprise that they didn’t really understand… or know how to keep, once things started moving.”</p> <p>“So what happened, specifically?” I ask. “Well, the same thing that happens whenever you try to hold sand with your hands and don’t get a bucket: phoosh, it runs through your fingers and then it’s gone. A few decades later the oil industry was in Oklahoma, Texas, everywhere, and then Cleveland was just a small part of it. Standard Oil and what-have-you relocated to New York City.” Sam takes a bite from his meatless burger. “I think the people of Cleveland were so caught off-guard by the enormous opportunity that hit them in the face that they reacted with some level of arrogance, hubris, and spent their time kind of pooh-poohing the industry, not realizing how lucky they were to be in pole position in the <em>competition</em> for this ginormous industry. So they were asleep at the wheel, and only when the industry moved into other cities did the people of Cleveland understand, by the sheer voracity of competition, how valuable this new industry was.”</p> <p>“You’re telling me the golden goose made a nest in their back yard and they basically just stayed inside drinking beers and jacking off.”</p> <p>“Yeah. And sometimes plucking the goose for feathers.”</p> <p>“That’s the dumbest fucking thing I’ve ever heard.” I’m looking up the Four Seasons Master Suites. Eight hundred feet of commercial and residential real estate. In the top ten floors, each apartment has a private pool. It’s some of the most valuable real estate on the planet, 4th and Market, downtown San Francisco, the heart of the safest city in the United States, a technological metropolis, a smoothly running engine generating compound growth of wealth every year, the altar of innovation. A testament to the power of courageous people coming together to build the future. Hong Kong and Singapore look sleepy by comparison. “I guess if people fail to seize opportunity, that’s on them, and they kinda self-select, they probably weren’t the right stewards of that opportunity in the first place.” A little delivery drone flies by silently and drops off a package through an apartment window.</p> <p>I get through the rest of the workday just fine. Our weekly 5PM resident’s poll was pretty interesting: one item on the poll asked me to vote on whether or not San Francisco should petition to host the 2032 International Kite Surfing Championships at a cost of about $311.60 per taxpayer. I’m a big fan, so I voted in favor.</p> <p>Rapidfire direct democracy is a great way to make small changes, while the larger changes deserve much more diligent debate. There’s currently a big discussion about whether the Sunset should have its housing density increased – the average …</p></article></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-10-01">Android Security Bulletin of October</a>, the vulnerability <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0423">CVE-2020-0423</a> was made public with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In binder_release_work of binder.c, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-0423</strong> is <a href="https://labs.bluefrostsecurity.de/blog/2020/03/31/cve-2020-0041-part-1-sandbox-escape/">yet</a> <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html">another</a> vulnerability in Android that can lead to privilege escalation. In this post, we will describe the bug and construct an exploit that can be used to gain
root privileges on an Android device.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-overview-of-binder">A Brief Overview of Binder</h3>
<p>Processes on Android are isolated and cannot access each other's memory directly. However they might require to, whether it's for exchanging data between a client and a server or simply to share information between two processes.</p>
<p>Interprocess communication on Android is performed by <strong>Binder</strong>. This kernel component provides a user-accessible character device which can be used to call routines in remote process and pass arguments to it. Binder acts as a proxy between two tasks and is also responsible, among others, for handling memory allocations during data exchange as well as managing shared object's lifespans.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Binder's internals, we invite you to read articles on the subject, such as <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/binder-transactions-in-the-bowels-of-the-linux-kernel">Synacktiv's "Binder Transactions In The Bowels of the Linux Kernel"</a>. It will come in handy to understand the rest of this post.</p>
<h3 id="patch-analysis-and-brief-explanation">Patch Analysis and Brief Explanation</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f3277cbfba763cd2826396521b9296de67cf1bbc#diff-8aa818b39daaf6497eaab2ec0b404bcabf43616362fe9551ed7dd2278682af08">patch</a> for CVE-2020-0423 was upstreamed on October 10th in the Linux kernel with the following commit message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>binder: fix UAF when releasing todo list</p>
<p>When releasing a thread todo list when tearing down
a binder_proc, the following race was possible which
could result in a use-after-free:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thread 1: enter binder_release_work from binder_thread_release</li>
<li>Thread 2: binder_update_ref_for_handle() -&gt; binder_dec_node_ilocked()</li>
<li>Thread 2: dec nodeA --&gt; 0 (will free node)</li>
<li>Thread 1: ACQ inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: block on inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 1: dequeue work (BINDER_WORK_NODE, part of nodeA)</li>
<li>Thread 1: REL inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: ACQ inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 2: todo list cleanup, but work was already dequeued</li>
<li>Thread 2: free node</li>
<li>Thread 2: REL inner_proc_lock</li>
<li>Thread 1: deref w-&gt;type (UAF)</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem was that for a BINDER_WORK_NODE, the binder_work element
must not be accessed after releasing the inner_proc_lock while
processing the todo list elements since another thread might be
handling a deref on the node containing the binder_work element
leading to the node being freed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gives a rough overview of the different steps required to trigger a Use-After-Free, or UAF, using this bug. These steps will be detailed in the next section, for now let's look at the patch to understand where the vulnerability comes from.</p>
<p>In essence, what this patch does is to inline the content of the function <code>binder_dequeue_work_head</code> in <code>binder_release_work</code>. The only difference being that the <code>type</code> field of the <code>binder_work</code> struct is read while the lock on <code>proc</code> is still held.</p>

<p>Before this patch, it was possible to dequeue a <code>binder_work</code> struct, have another thread free and reallocate it to then change the control flow of <code>binder_release_work</code>. The next section will try to give a more thorough explanation as to why this behavior occurs and how it can be triggered arbitrarily.</p>
<h3 id="in-depth-analysis">In-Depth Analysis</h3>
<p>In this section, as an example, let's imagine that there are two processes communicating using binder: a sender and a receiver.</p>
<p>At this point, there are three prerequisites to trigger the bug:</p>
<ol>
<li>a call to <code>binder_release_work</code> from the sender's thread</li>
<li>a <code>binder_work</code> structure to dequeue from the sender thread's <code>todo</code> list</li>
<li>a free on the <code>binder_work</code> structure from the receiver thread</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's go over them one by one and try to figure out a way to fulfill them.</p>
<h4 id="calling-binder_release_work">Calling <code>binder_release_work</code></h4>
<p>This prerequisite is pretty straightforward. As explained earlier, <code>binder_release_work</code> is part of the clean up routine when a task is done using binder. It can be called explicitly in a thread using the ioctl command <code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Userland code from the exploit</span>

<p>This ioctl will end up calling the kernel function <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#4977"><code>binder_ioctl</code></a> located at <code>drivers/android/binder.c</code>.</p>
<p><code>binder_ioctl</code> will then reach the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#5038"><code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code></a> case and call <code>binder_thread_release</code>. <code>thread</code> is a <code>binder_thread</code> structure containing information about the current thread which made the <code>ioctl</code> call.</p>

<p>These functions are used in different places in the code, but an interesting code path is the one starting in <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#2524"><code>binder_translate_binder</code></a>. This function is called when a thread sends a transaction containing a <code>BINDER_TYPE_BINDER</code> or a <code>BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_BINDER</code>.</p>
<p>A binder node is created from this binder object and the reference counter for the process on the receiving end is increased. As long as the receiving process holds a reference to this node, it will stay alive in Binder's memory. However, if the process releases the reference, the node is destroyed, which is what we will try to achieve later on to trigger the UAF.</p>
<p>First, let's explain how the binder node and the <code>thread-&gt;todo</code> list are related
in the call to <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/13abe236365485368755fb76c57a67a9b1f640d8/drivers/android/binder.c#2553"><code>binder_inc_ref_for_node</code></a>.</p>

  <p><span>knowledge</span></p><p>21 Dec 2020</p>


<p>3 minute read</p>

<p>A <strong>digital attic</strong> is a collection of the links and content you’ve found on the web. I store mine in a <a href="https://uzpg.me/attic.html">markdown file</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Uzay-G/portfolio/blob/master/attic.md">source</a>). It’s meant to be easy to move around and share, and I usually update mine every once in a while by pooling from my bookmarks.</p>

<p>This “attic” has two purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a readable, clear organization of all the cool stuff you find online. This allows you to look back on old content easily. The problem with the way most browsers handle bookmarks is that you always have to go through a certain amount of effort to have some sort of flexible, readable and clean organization of your links.</li>
  <li>Be able to share the things you’ve found interesting and also exchange with other people’s attics.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve found some similar implementations of <a href="https://zalberico.com/about/">digital attics</a> online, and always found them insightful and useful.</p>

<p>However, this process of indexing and then revisiting these links showed me another problem with the way content persists on the web.</p>
      <h2 id="link-rot">
        
        
          Link rot <a href="#link-rot">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>I updated <a href="https://uzpg.me/attic.html">my attic</a> yesterday, and noticed that quite a few links no longer returned anything.</p>

<p>This is <strong>link rot</strong>, the gradual abandonment of websites / content that leads to a loss of information and <strong>public record</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/linkrot-1.jpg" alt="link rot visualization"></p>

<p>This loss is linked to the financial / time commitment needed to run a website. <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Jeff Huang’s manifesto “Designed to Last”</a> also describes this problem and potential ways to simplify serving content and make your websites more resilient.</p>

<p>Another approach, proposed by the Internet Archive and its amazing <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> initiative is to actually store copies of websites as they were in the past.</p>

<p>A similar way I’m trying to work on this problem is <a href="https://archivy.github.io/">Archivy</a>, a knowledge base tool that stores local copies of web-pages in Markdown. One of its core focuses is <a href="https://archivy.github.io/difference/">extensibility</a> and building in ways for users to interact with their knowledge programmatically.</p>
      <h2 id="making-things-easy">
        
        
          Making things easy <a href="#making-things-easy">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Organizational tasks like these can sometimes get tedious (especially if you have to check if the links still work), and it can be annoying to waste too much time on updating your attic. This is why in my case I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/Uzay-G/garret">simple Crystal script</a> that converts the Firefox JSON bookmark export to clean Markdown.</p>

<p>Since there are obviously some links I don’t think are useful to put into my attic, I also added some functionality where you can store a file with links to be ignored.</p>

<p>This process helps me quickly update my attic whenever I feel like it, but more than that, it would make it easy for me to download web-pages automatically, preventing them from degrading with link rot.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about adding a few features to this tool that would work against this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code could connect to the <a href="https://archivy.github.io/reference/web_api/">Archivy Web API</a> and pass it the page URLs for it to save and mirror them.</li>
  <li>Automatic checking of which links are no longer up.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recommend finding a way to automate the action of updating your attic if you build one, because it’ll help make the process more fun.</p>

<p>This concept is merely an idea for a manner in which you can index this information, but I’m sure there are many other innovative and creative way to go about this (and I’d love to hear about them!).</p>

<p>If you find any other intriguing attics, please link them! I’m always curious :)</p>

<p>2020-12-20</p>


<p>About two years ago, I wrote a quite complicated diff tool in Clojure.<br>
It was complicated enough that I struggled to fit the algorithm in my head and the inputs were large enough that I had to make some efforts to improve performance.</p>
<p>About half a year later, I started learning Rust, ported the current state of the Clojure program into Rust, was very happy with the change<sup><a href="#hooked-on-rust">1</a></sup> and continued exclusively with Rust.<br>
While working on that project, I've developed some opinions about the two languages, especially about error handling and performance:</p>
<p>I think that these are areas where Rust excels, while they are among the weaker spots of Clojure<sup><a href="#not-hating-on-clojure">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To put my experience in context:
I had a bit more than one year of experience in Clojure when I moved to Rust.
The diff tool was by far the largest Clojure program I've ever written, and it was only about 3000 lines.<br>
When I started writing Rust, reimplementing the existing Clojure code was among my first Rust code.
I've continued learning Rust since then and have mostly stopped writing Clojure.<br>
If things have changed in Clojure recently, please let me know and I'll update the article.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling"><a href="#error-handling" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling">🔗</a>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The error handling requirements in this project were not very complicated.
All errors just needed to be logged and returned to the user.<br>
The only slightly unusual requirement was that parsing and validation logic should show all errors for each row in both uploaded excel files
(instead of just the first error) so I had to accumulate errors.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-clojure"><a href="#error-handling-in-clojure" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-clojure">🔗</a>Error Handling in Clojure</h3>
<p>Error handling in Clojure is not opinionated.<br>
<a href="https://lispcast.com/clojure-error-messages-accidental/">Similar to error messages</a>
, what error handling idioms exist in Clojure seem to me to be largely accidental or inherited from Java.</p>
<p>The standard library mostly supports <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ex-info">exceptions</a>.<br>
There are some libraries that support returning error values instead of throwing exceptions like the error handling library <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure"><code>failjure</code></a>.<br>
Others, like the parsing library <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse"><code>instaparse</code></a>, return their own custom error values<sup><a href="#insta-result">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I used failjure to help accumulate errors in a nicer way (and because it appealed to my Haskell-influenced taste).</p>
<p>Let's look at a Clojure function from my diff tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure#attempt-all">attempt-all</a> to parse and validate the input data.
If any errors occur, all errors are aggregated into a string:</p>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>parse
  </span><span>[country-mapping data]
  #_"</span><span>   👇 the attempt-all function exits early 
           if any binding returned a failure</span><span>"
  (</span><span>fail/attempt-all
   </span><span>[headers (</span><span>header-row</span><span> data)

<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifier-expression pairs in the square brackets use the same syntax as Clojure's <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/let"><code>let</code>-form</a>
which makes it look familiar.</li>
<li>I can optionally add an error handling function to the very end, which is helpful to, e.g., log the argument of the function, as I did here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't see which functions can actually fail. I have to read them to find out.</li>
<li>Since the Clojure ecosystem doesn't have a uniform error handling style, I have to manually convert exceptions or other errors like <code>instaparse</code> error values to <code>failjure</code> errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
Since Clojure is a Lisp, it's possible to use most kinds of error handling and make it look fine, if you really want to.
The most pragmatic solution in most cases will be to use exceptions.</p>
<p>I found that readability could suffer when using less explicit error handling, especially in a dynamic language.</p>
<p>Due to the freedom of choice in error handling approacher, I was tempted to experiment more than with a more opinionated language.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-rust"><a href="#error-handling-in-rust" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-rust">🔗</a>Error handling in Rust</h3>
<p>Rust is quite opinionated about error handling.
The Rust community has worked on developing and improving common idioms, some of which were incorporated into the standard library, thereby improving the baseline error handling.</p>
<p>There's no improvement without change though, and the frequent changes have been a source of complaints.
While backwards compatibility was never broken, people that wanted their code to be idiomatic had to update it anyway.
Old tutorials and guides have therefore also become outdated.</p>
<p>There are lots of good, up-to-date articles about error handling in Rust<sup><a href="#rust-error-handling-links">4</a></sup>, which help learn the current idioms.</p>
<p>In Rust, functions that can error return the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html"><code>Result</code></a> type<sup><a href="#panic-ref">5</a></sup>.<br>
There are several libraries that make creating your own errors or handling errors from libraries easier, but they (mostly) just use the types from the standard library instead of introducing new stuff that's incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let's look at the same function as before, but this time in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(
    </span><span>workbook</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Workbook,
    </span><span>country_mapping</span><span>: CountryMapping,
) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Rule&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = workbook
        .</span><span>worksheet_range</span><span>("</span><span>Rules</span><span>")
        </span><span>// this question mark triggers an early exit
        // there are two because we have an Option
        // containing a Result                    👇
        </span><span>.</span><span>ok_or</span><span>(format_err!("</span><span>Missing Rules sheet</span><span>"))??;
        </span><span>//                               👇
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = </span><span>skip_to_header_row</span><span>(range)?;
    </span><span>let</span><span> parsed = RangeDeserializerBuilder::new()

    }))

            "</span><span>Failed to parse {} rules:</span><span>\n</span><span>{}</span><span>",
            es.</span><span>len</span><span>(),
            </span><span>// 👇 very elegant...
            //    this would just be one .joinToString call in Kotlin
</span><span>            es.</span><span>into_iter</span><span>()
                .</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>e</span><span>| e.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())

        )
   </span><span>// 👇
    </span><span>})?;
    Ok(rules)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard library, every Rust library I've ever seen and my own application code is always using the same <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a> type, which keeps things pretty compatible.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">The <code>?</code> operator</a> makes fallible functions visible but keeps it succinct.<br>
It also automatically converts error types where possible, which reduces the need for manual type conversion.</li>
<li>The error type I'm using here from the library <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/index.html"><code>anyhow</code></a> supports a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/trait.Context.html"><code>.context</code></a> method, which gives otherwise unhelpful low-level errors the necessary context.<br>
This is usually done in exception-based languages by catching, wrapping and rethrowing, but this looks a lot more pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to keep the error types compatible, which I accomplish in this case by not distinguishing between different error types at all<sup><a href="#anyhow-usecase">6</a></sup>.<br>
I still have to return a single error value, which means I have to manually and verbosely convert the list of errors into a single one - in this case a newline-delimited string.</li>
<li>If I want to log something when this entire function returns an error or add some <code>.context</code> to it, I would like to have the equivalent of a <code>try/catch</code>-block around the entire function body.<br>
This doesn't exist yet<sup><a href="#try-blocks">7</a></sup>, the current best practice seems to be do move the entire body into an inner function or lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
In Rust, you will use the <code>Result</code> type and you will like it<sup><a href="#and-you'll-like-it">8</a></sup>.<br>
The main design decisions are whether you use some of the helper libraries and how you design your error types.</p>
<p>Designing the error types can be a challenge though, especially because it's a bit different than designing e.g. Java exception hierarchies.<br>
I was lucky that keeping up to date with the evolving error handling idioms wasn't too hard for me as I was not under time pressure and often worked in my spare time with learning as my primary objective.
It might have been painful for teams maintaining bigger production systems.<br>
The large number of error handling tutorials and articles should hopefully make it easier to learn now than it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>The learning curve aside:
To me, Rust's error handling feels like part of the secret sauce that makes it the most promising language for correctness that I know of.</p>
<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="Anchor link for: performance">🔗</a>Performance</h2>
<p>The part of the program that caused performance issues was the diff algorithm and, to a slightly lesser extent, a data normalization step before that.<br>
The type of performance problems I had were mostly being CPU bound, having to generate and compare a lot of temporary data.
The large amount of data also often caused memory issues in both languages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>From training to deployment with Metaflow and Cortex</h4></p><div content-type="article"><p>If we were to design an optimal machine learning pipeline, it would be:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scalable</strong>. As workloads increased, it would scale up without issue.</li><li><strong>Reproducible</strong>. We would be able to draw a line from any model to its data.</li><li><strong>Configurable</strong>. It wouldn’t lock us into particular frameworks or tools.</li></ul><p>Typically, pipelines will tradeoff in at least one of these areas. A pipeline might be scalable, but will rely on a platform that puts limits on data scientists. Or, a pipeline will be completely configurable, but will also be glued together by a mess of ad hoc code and will be impossible to reproduce.</p><p>In this piece, I want to introduce a way to build this kind of ideal pipeline without any tradeoffs. To do this, we’ll be using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank">Metaflow, the open source data science framework from Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">Cortex, our open source deployment platform for machine learning</a>. </p><p>Let’s start by defining our pipeline.</p><h3>Defining a pipeline in Metaflow</h3><p>Metaflow is a data science framework that provides a single API for managing different pieces of the infrastructure stack. It places an emphasis on scalability, reproducibility, and usability.</p><div><p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5VGddmP24" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></div><p>At a high level, Metaflow allows us to define pipelines as DAGs, called “flows,” in which data undergoes a sequence of transformations called ”steps.” These steps persist transformed data as “data artifacts,” which are accessible by subsequent steps throughout the flow. </p><p>For example, say we had a training flow that loaded data (probably produced by another flow), trained multiple models with different strategies, evaluated the different models, and saved the top performer:</p><p>This is just a snapshot of our full pipeline, which I’ll be adding to in the next section, but even with just this snippet we have a repeatable training pipeline that can scale to run on many machines. We also have, thanks to Metaflow’s Client API, a way to version, audit, and reproduce these training runs.</p><p>For example, to instantiate a given step from a previous flow, we can simply pass in the flow name, run id, and step name to the Metaflow Client:</p><p>To access an artifact from a particular run, the logic is very similar:</p><p>This means that every time a flow is executed, Metaflow automatically versions and records it using a standard taxonomy. As a result, we can trace any given model’s lineage from raw data to final export. </p><p>There is much more to Metaflow, and I’d encourage you to check out their <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a> to learn more, but as an introduction, this should serve to get us started. </p><p>Now, let’s talk a bit about triggering deployments in Metaflow.</p><h3>Deploying models with Cortex</h3><p>In this section, I’m going to take our training flow from before and add a step for deploying our model as a production API on AWS. To do this, we’re going to use Cortex.</p><p>Cortex is a deployment platform for machine learning. On the surface, it provides simple interfaces for building prediction services, deploying them to production, and managing an inference cluster. </p><p>Under the hood, Cortex automates all of the cloud infrastructure needed for inference—autoscaling, GPU/ASIC support, load balancing, prediction tracking, etc—and implements a automated deployment process in which model serving code is packaged, versioned, and deployed to the cluster.</p><p>We can trigger a deployment using Cortex’s Python client within our training flow like this:</p><p>You’ll notice the client includes a deploy() method, which takes a configuration object for defining our API. This configuration works with the Metaflow client to extract the location of the model, and the metadata of the flow for logging purposes. Now, when we audit our deployments, we can connect it all the way back to the run that produced it, extending our lineage from data to deployment.</p><p>The configuration object also references a predict.py script, which is where the actual prediction service is defined. A Cortex predictor looks like this:</p><p>The structure is very simple. We initialize our model in the init() function, which runs on initial deployment, and we generate predictions in the predict() function. Similar to steps in Metaflow, these Python methods can contain whatever logic you want to implement.</p><p>Now, when we run the flow, the model will be trained, evaluated, and deployed to production with zero downtime or extra configuration needed. </p><p>Because Cortex provides native support for A/B testing and traffic splitting, we can even run complex deployment strategies without breaking Metaflow’s lineage.</p><p>For example, if after selecting a best model, we wanted to test how the model performed in different formats—say ONNX vs TensorFlow—we could export two versions of the model, deploy them both in an A/B test, and log their performance. Because our training flow is connected to our deployment, we can then pass this information back and forth between Cortex and Metaflow without issue.</p><h3>An easier path to production machine learning</h3><p>Over the years, a number of end-to-end data science platforms have been released, and most of them fall into the same traps:</p><ul role="list"><li>Providing a smooth interface, with zero transparency into what’s happening under the hood, killing reproducibility and auditing.</li><li>Solving one part of the stack well, like training, but “bolting on” under-developed solutions for other parts, like deployment.</li><li>Locking data scientists and machine learning engineers into a narrow stack by only supporting specific frameworks and integrations.</li></ul><p>The result is a platform that makes production machine learning easy—if you stay strictly within the confines of the system. When you have a diverse set of problems to solve, however, this is difficult to do.</p><p>Metaflow and Cortex represent a fundamentally different, human-centric approach. The emphasis is not on providing a magic solution to a narrow set of problems, but on providing an easy interface for building solutions to any problem.</p><p>If you’re interested in digging into either platform, check out the links below:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Metaflow documentation: </strong> <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">https://docs.metaflow.org/</a></li><li><strong>Metaflow GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow</a></li><li><strong>Cortex documentation: </strong><a href="https://docs.cortex.dev/" target="_blank">https://docs.cortex.dev/</a></li><li><strong>Cortex GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex</a></li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<pre>Hi,

I saw your recent discussion on running Project Oberon on RISC-V. I've been
working on a RISC-V port for the last few months, which might be
interesting to you. A port of Project Oberon to RISC-V (i.e. a RV32IM
compiler and a port of the rest of the system), as well as an emulator that
can run it, can be found in these repositories:

<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv</a>
<a href="https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu">https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv-emu</a>

If you just want to try it, there's a disk image included with the emulator.

To my knowledge, this RISC-V port is more complete than others that I have
found: the compiler can compile the Oberon system as well as itself, and
the system runs well in the emulator. It lacks support for REALs and
interrupts at the moment, but most programs are able to run without them.

The port is built on top of several other Oberon-related projects, which
I've credited in oberon-riscv's readme.

I'm planning to make it run on an FPGA in the future too, although that
will have to come after the holidays.

Kind regards,
Rikke

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The Volta team is thrilled to announce that Volta 1.0.0 is now available! Volta is a fast, reliable utility for declaring your JavaScript <a href="http://calculist.org/blog/2020/12/21/tac/">Toolchains as Code</a>. In much the same way that Infrastructure as Code frees teams from manually managing their server infrastructure, <strong>Volta takes the hassle out of installing and coordinating JavaScript tools</strong>—such as Node, package managers, and package binaries—so that you can focus on creating awesome software.
<!--more--></p>



<p>The 1.0.0 release means that Volta is ready for general use in projects of all sizes. The new features included in version 1.0.0 are the last pieces in a string of work—begun with Volta 0.9.0—to make the most common tools work seamlessly with the benefits that Volta provides.</p>

<p>At the same time, 1.0.0 means more than, “we implemented some high-impact functionality and finally closed some long-standing issues.” From the beginning, Volta was built to empower engineers and engineering teams to build amazing JS applications without having to worry about their environment or tooling. For individual engineers, Volta unobtrusively makes sure your tooling is aligned with the needs of your project, allowing you to stay focused on your work. For engineering teams, Volta allows you to manage your infrastructure decision-making centrally without slowing down individual team members. When the team decides to change versions of Node, for example, that doesn’t require explicit effort on the part of each developer. With version 1.0.0, we believe Volta delivers on the promise of making tool management disappear.</p>

<p>Last, version 1.0.0 represents a commitment to stability. As we continue to add new features and support for more tools, we are committed to doing so in a backwards-compatible way. You can be confident that new releases won’t break your workflows or scripts.</p>



<h2 id="support-for-npm-link">Support for <code>npm link</code></h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.volta.sh/2020/10/22/announcing-volta-090/">release of Volta 0.9.0</a>, we added support for installing tools directly with your package manager while still taking advantage of the benefits that Volta provides. We have extended that support to include linking your local packages with <code>npm link</code>, even across different npm versions. Additionally, if you try to link two projects that are using different Node versions, Volta will alert you that there might be incompatibilities that cause unexpected behavior.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-upgrading-global-packages">Support for upgrading global packages</h2>

<p>You can now upgrade your installed global packages directly with your package manager, using <code>npm update -g</code> or <code>yarn global upgrade</code>. Volta will make sure that the package manager can locate all of the packages so that they can be upgraded to their latest versions.</p>



<p>While we believe that Volta 1.0.0 achieves the goals for the project, that doesn’t mean that we are done! Active development will continue on Volta: adding new features, support for new tools, and fixing any bugs that crop up. A few items on our near-term roadmap include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native builds for Apple M1 devices</li>
  <li>Support for using <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/"><code>pnpm</code></a> as your package manager</li>
  <li>Improvements to <code>volta list</code>, making it easier to visualize the state of your tools</li>
</ul>



<p>To try Volta for the first time or upgrade your existing installation, follow the instructions on our <a href="https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page!</p>

<p>Finally, this release is the culmination of more than two years of work from a whole host of contributors. It wouldn’t have been possible without all of your ideas, feedback, bug reports, code, and encouragement. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone in the community for your support.</p>

December 21, 2020 | https://healeycodes.com/building-my-own-chess-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://healeycodes.com/building-my-own-chess-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 20, 2020<!-- --> in<!-- --> <span><a href="https://healeycodes.com/tags/python">Python</a></span></p></header><section><p>I have been learning chess (again) and how to program a chess engine (for the first time) over the last month. After skimming some introductory texts, I was convinced that building a simple chess engine — one that would put up a fair fight against a casual player — would take no more than a few days.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But I made it there in the end and created a toy chess engine (<a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">healeycodes/andoma</a>) that I am proud of. It can play a game of chess and solve simple chess puzzles like mate-in-two or mate-in-three. It has a slim UCI interface which means it can be hooked up to lichess.org via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a> — a bridge between the lichess API and chess bots.</p>
<p>The first speed bump in its development was grasping the computational the complexity of chess — how fast, and wide, the search tree grows. When a chess game starts, white can open in twenty different ways and black can respond in twenty different ways also. After the first full turn, there are 400 variations possible. After the third full turn, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number#Shannon's_calculation">over 119 million</a>.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon calculated that there are around <code>10^120</code> possible games of chess in his seminal paper <em>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess</em> in 1950. In <em>Rage Against the Machines</em>, Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rage-against-the-machines/">quotes</a> Diego Rasskin-Gutman, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more possible chess games than the number of atoms in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given unlimited resources, it actually doesn’t take many lines of code to calculate every legal variation of chess. Here, the Python package <a href="https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">python-chess</a> is used for board representation and legal move generation.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> chess <span>import</span> Board<span>,</span> Move<span>,</span> STARTING_FEN


positions <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>


<span>def</span> <span>generate_tree</span><span>(</span>fen<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    board <span>=</span> Board<span>(</span>fen<span>)</span>
    legal_moves <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span>board<span>.</span>legal_moves<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> fen <span>in</span> positions<span>:</span>
        positions<span>[</span>fen<span>]</span> <span>+=</span> legal_moves
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        positions<span>[</span>fen<span>]</span> <span>=</span> legal_moves

    <span>for</span> move <span>in</span> legal_moves<span>:</span>
        board<span>.</span>push<span>(</span>move<span>)</span>
        next_fen <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>fen<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        board<span>.</span>pop<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        
        generate_tree<span>(</span>next_fen<span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    generate_tree<span>(</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
<span>except</span> RecursionError<span>:</span> 
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>positions<span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span>p<span>)</span> <span>for</span> p <span>in</span> positions<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This program throws a <code>RecursionError</code> and prints <code>59691</code> — the number of different positions the search tree contained when it crashed. All we need to fix this, is another universe to run the program in.</p>
<p>Given that there are computational limits to abide by, as well as the time control rules of chess, improvements over a naive brute force search must be made.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation"><a href="#evaluation" aria-label="evaluation permalink"></a>Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to search for good positions, it is necessary to understand what makes a good position <em>good</em>. The most simplistic way of describing a position’s strength is to compare the total value material of each side.</p>
<p>Tomasz Michniewski, author of the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function">Simplified Evaluation Function</a>, defined some values that are “designed specifically to compensate for the lack of any other chess knowledge”. This is perfect for me — a beginner chess player.</p>
<p>This snippet sums the material on the initial board using Michniewski’s piece values.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> chess

piece_values <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    chess<span>.</span>PAWN<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>

    chess<span>.</span>QUEEN<span>:</span> <span>900</span><span>,</span>
    chess<span>.</span>KING<span>:</span> <span>20000</span>
<span>}</span>

board <span>=</span> chess<span>.</span>Board<span>(</span>chess<span>.</span>STARTING_FEN<span>)</span>
white_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
black_material <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

<span>for</span> square <span>in</span> chess<span>.</span>SQUARES<span>:</span>
    piece <span>=</span> board<span>.</span>piece_at<span>(</span>square<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> piece<span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>
    <span>if</span> piece<span>.</span>color <span>==</span> chess<span>.</span>WHITE<span>:</span>
        white_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        black_material <span>+=</span> piece_values<span>[</span>piece<span>.</span>piece_type<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Michniewski also provides <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Piece-Square_Tables">piece-square tables</a>, which alter the value of a piece depending on which square it sits on. For example, it’s better for pawns to progress up the board and it’s better for knights to be near the center of the board.</p>
<p>The bonus of a square may be positive, neutral, or negative. The piece-square tables are presented from White’s POV and must be mirrored for Black.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># a knight's bonuses depending on square
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,
-40,-20,  0,  0,  0,  0,-20,-40,
-30,  0, 10, 15, 15, 10,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 15, 20, 20, 15,  5,-30,
-30,  0, 15, 20, 20, 15,  0,-30,
-30,  5, 10, 15, 15, 10,  5,-30,
-40,-20,  0,  5,  5,  0,-20,-40,
-50,-40,-30,-30,-30,-30,-40,-50,</code></pre></div>
<p>For the king, Michniewski provides two tables — one for the middle game and one for the end game. He defines the end game as being either if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both sides have no queens or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every side which has a queen has additionally no other pieces or one minorpiece maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evaluation of a chess board is one of the things that’s kept me interested in chess engines. Evaluation rules are easy to add and take away. I refactored the code from Go to Python to be able to prototype different rules faster.</p>
<p>After piece-square tables, one might look at pawn structure, mobility, center control, connectivity, trapped pieces, king safety, space, tempo, and other patterns (this list is taken from the Chess Programming Wiki’s <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation">Evaluation</a> page).</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-minimax"><a href="#searching-with-minimax" aria-label="searching with minimax permalink"></a>Searching With Minimax</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> is a search algorithm that finds the next optimal move by minimizing the potential loss in a worst case scenario. Chess is a game of perfect information — by looking at the board it’s possible to know exactly what an opponent is capable of. However, this search for moves is limited by the evaluation function and the depth that computing resources are able to reach.</p>
<p>The search space is a tree of legal moves which grows exponentially at every level (the average branching factor is around 35). By the time the tree is explored, the path to many future boards is known as well as which path restricts the opponent’s possible gains the most.</p>
<p>The leaf nodes of the tree return the evaluation of their current state. Non-leaf nodes inherit their value from a descendant node. Eventually, the recursive function reduces down to a value for the given board.</p>
<p>This function can be used to pick the next best move by calling it on every legal move available in the current turn. A great visual resource for this algorithm is Sebastian Lague’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI">Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning</a>.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>minimax</span><span>(</span>board<span>,</span> depth<span>,</span> maximizing_player<span>)</span><span>:</span>

<h2 id="alpha-beta-pruning"><a href="#alpha-beta-pruning" aria-label="alpha beta pruning permalink"></a>Alpha-beta pruning</h2>
<p>My chess engine uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> as an improvement over the naive minimax algorithm — which does not fare well against the exponential nature of chess. Branches of the search tree can be eliminated when it is clear that another branch shows more promise. This significantly reduces the number of moves required to be generated.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/a99200aacf6d6cfc643aaa45317d65aa/42a19/alpha-beta-pruning.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>By reducing the depth of branches that will not bear fruit we can search deeper down the better parts of the tree.</p>
<p>The speed of alpha-beta pruning can be increased by applying <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move ordering</a>. This is where the more promising branches of the search tree are searched first — which means less time is spent in the worst branches as they will be cut off early.</p>
<p>Move ordering cannot be 100% accurate but it’s a powerful optimization.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma">my engine</a>, a cheap (but not perfect) <code>move_value</code> function is used to sort the initial legal move nodes from best to worst. The logic of this function is capture in its docstring:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>'''
How good is a move?
A promotion is great.
A weaker piece taking a stronger piece is good.
A stronger piece taking a weaker piece is bad.
Also consider the position change via piece-square table.
'''</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="communication-and-the-uci-protocol"><a href="#communication-and-the-uci-protocol" aria-label="communication and the uci protocol permalink"></a>Communication and the UCI Protocol</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/andoma/blob/main/uci-interface.md">Universal Chess Interface</a> (UCI) is a open protocol to hook up chess engines to user interfaces. The communication is done through standard input and standard output and messages end with <code>\n</code>. The move format is long algebraic notation — like <code>e2e4</code>, or <code>e1g1</code> for white short castling, and an example of a promotion to queen is <code>a7a8q</code>.</p>
<p>There are many configuration commands in the specification and it initially seemed overwhelming. After debugging, I found that not many were required to get a chess engine to the <em>Hello World</em> stage.</p>
<p>In order to hook my chess engine up to lichess via <a href="https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot">lichess-bot</a>, I implemented the following. These commands are send to the engine from lichess-bot:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uci</code> - the engine reports its name, authors, and <code>uciok</code></li>
<li><code>isready</code> - the engine reports that it’s ready: <code>readyok</code></li>
<li><code>position startpos moves e2e4</code> - the engine sets it’s internal state to match the list of moves</li>
<li><code>go</code> - the engine should now calculate and respond with the next best move, like <code>g8f6</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-promise"><a href="#a-promise" aria-label="a promise permalink"></a>A Promise</h2>
<p>I have found a great joy interacting with the chess community over the last month. Lichess is a fantastic resource and endlessly fun to play on. The UI is slick and light — and the post-match analysis is revealing and simple to use. It’s <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila">open source</a> and relies on donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>I took breaks from writing this article to play chess against Dad on a real board. We’re missing a white rook and use a pencil sharpener as a replacement piece. He has been telling me stories about playing chess decades ago — before IBM’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> emerged and beat Garry Kasparov, the reigning world champion, on its second attempt in 1997.</p>
<p>If you are within my social circle, you will have experienced me evangelizing chess and chess engines over the last month — now that I have published this, I promise to chill out a little bit ♟️</p>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a href="#other-resources" aria-label="other resources permalink"></a>Other Resources</h2>

<hr>



<p>Now my gut reaction when anyone refers to “the launch of a new platform” with glowing descriptions and prescriptive outlook, is to remember Geoffrey James’ “Tao of Programming” – but this is more important than mere nerd flippancy, and so worthy of some deeper consideration. </p>



<p>The announcement continues:</p>



<hr>



<blockquote><p>Europol’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3">European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)</a>&nbsp;will operate the platform and leverage its in-house expertise in providing the most effective support to national Member State investigations.</p><cite>q.v.</cite></blockquote>

And … “TWINS”? Ick.</figcaption></figure>



<hr>



<p>So, basically, this sounds something along the lines of <em>“we bought a whole pile of GPUs and/or rented them from somewhere, and we’re announcing it before Christmas so that people know that we are <strong>‘doing something about cyber™’</strong>“</em></p>



<p>But why would that be interesting? Why announce something? And why now?</p>



<p><strong>Gut feeling</strong>, followed by a <strong>wild, unsubstantiated guess</strong>: this is not a capability which one would normally announce. Stuff like this is very nerdy, and best kept in-house. Therefore it is being announced for a “soft goal”, done for the sake of being seen to be done. </p>



<p>What’s a good soft goal? Well, based upon my corporate (rather than Government) experience, there are two obvious options:</p>



<ol><li>“We have budget that we have to spend, and which we have to be seen to be spending, so that we can get the same or increased budget, next year”; or, more interestingly…</li><li>Someone with an ounce of sense regarding strategic face-saving, is looking at all the European Commission-led brouhaha regarding <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/">“We need to have good security IN SPITE of good security, oh, wait, did I say security? I meant ‘encryption’, of course”</a> – and  is announcing this in order to have a face-saving programme in the (likely? I hope likely) instance that all of that political sound and fury, comes to nothing.</li></ol>



<p>Number 2 is particularly interesting to me because the European Commission is called-out on the press release headline; I can’t imagine that as happening on a more mundane, geek- or budget-led press release. Hence thinking that the EC want to be seen to be taking a diversity of approaches towards encryption. </p>



<p>Maybe I am wrong, so perhaps someone who knows more about the operations of Europol press releases, can comment? Anonymously, via Strong Encryption and Tor, if desired?</p>

<h2 id="foreword"><a href="#foreword" aria-label="foreword permalink"></a>Foreword</h2>
<p>Welcome to the second issue of the <em>eBPF Updates</em>! This time we have
interesting resources about how to write eBPF programs with Zig, or with Rust,
or on how to manage them with libbpf. On the kernel side, modules now support
BTF, and improvements to memory accounting for eBPF should help to solve the
limitations of rlimit. Did this just sound incomprehensible to you? Do not
fear, we also have some gentle introductions to eBPF in the list. This issue
also introduces a “Did You Know” section, and this time the focus is on CO-RE.
Read, learn, trace, and filter!</p>

<li><a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/the-top-reasons-why-you-should-give-ebpf-a-chance"><em>The Top Reasons Why You Should Give eBPF a Chance</em></a>,
from Lucas Severo Alves.<br>
Several factors are responsible for eBPF's success and should make readers
consider learning about, or using, this technology. This post cites its
powerful tracing capabilities, with the ability to attach to nearly any
function in the kernel with little impact on performance. Another reason is
that more and more companies, including large ones, are adopting eBPF; a
detailed list follows. At last, eBPF makes it possible to quickly develop
tools to instrument new parts of the kernel, without the need to go through a
longer process to upstream new attach points.</li>
<li><a href="https://cmd.com/blog/making-bpf-easy-with-libbpf-and-zig/"><em>Making BPF easy with libbpf and Zig</em></a>,
from Matt Knight.<br>
The <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> programming language is used to create and
handle a simple eBPF program in this tutorial, both for the user space loader
and the eBPF program itself. The objective is mostly to understand how libbpf
manipulates the ELF object containing a program in order to load it, but
compiling from Zig, which aims at competing with C while offering some newer
features, may open new perspectives. The code is available
<a href="https://github.com/mattnite/zig-bpf-intro">on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/13943">Weight support for Cilium's eBPF-based Maglev load balancer implementation</a>,
from Fankaixi Li.<br>
A new pull request by a software engineer at ByteDance (TikTok) popped up,
adding weight support to the eBPF-based
<a href="https://cilium.io/blog/2020/11/10/cilium-19#maglev">Maglev implementation in Cilium</a>.
Maglev provides consistent hashing for high-availability scenarios, and
balance packets to the same backends even if they arrive at different load
balancing nodes. The feature adds the possibility to assign weights to favor
some backends. It is still being discussed, but should land soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/ekDR/beyond-the-buzzword-bpfs-unexpected-role-in-kubernetes-andrew-randall-alban-crequy-kinvolk"><em>Beyond the Buzzword: BPF’s Unexpected Role in Kubernetes</em></a>,
from Andrew Randall and Alban Crequy.<br>
After a high-level overview of eBPF, this presentation depicts the landscape
of the projects gravitating around this technology. The authors explain that
there are many powerful tools based on eBPF, although none of them would
cover Kubernetes clusters. As an answer to fill the gap, they introduce
Inspektor Gadget, which reuses some elements from the bcc tools to provide a
new set of monitoring gadgets for examining Pods. Note that the wording in
the slides might be misleading: If there was no equivalent to bcc for tracing
containers before Inspektor Gadget, there <em>are</em> other tools targeting the
platform, such as Cilium/Hubble for network and observability or BPFd for
running bcc scripts in containers.</li>
<li><a href="https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/"><em>TIL: eBPF is awesome</em></a>,
from Filip Nikolovski.<br>
We all agree on this! This post is a gentle introduction to eBPF. A bit of
history, some details on the core infrastructure and its components, and a
simple “Hello, World!” example extracted from
<a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/34cada17f798b8e00268d1ba4a4a8d765b948532/examples/tracing/hello_fields.py">the bcc tools</a>.
A nice read if you just got started with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://suchakra.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/building-an-esoteric-filesystem-tracing-tool-with-ebpf/"><em>Building an Esoteric Filesystem Tracing Tool with eBPF</em></a>,
from Suchakra Sharma.<br>
This post has a focus on the read-ahead mechanism in the Linux kernel. After
providing a refresher on how read-ahead works, Suchakra explains in details
how eBPF can monitor the hit rate and efficiency of this mechanism. It turns
out that the program used to do that already exists in two versions, one with
a mix of C and Python proper to the bcc tools, and another one based on
libbpf and the newer features brought by the library, like CO-RE (Compile
Once, Run Everywhere). The last section details the benefits of the latter
version and the motivations to port tools to libbpf.</li>
<li><a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/data/proceedings.pdf#section*.12"><em>eXpress Data Path Kernel Objects for Real-Time Audio Streaming Optimization</em></a> (PDF),
from Christoph Kuhr and Alexander Carôt.<br>
Focusing on audio packet processing, this work aims at facilitating the set
up of a rehearsal environment for conducted orchestras via the Internet with
up to sixty musicians. The system may be susceptible to latency issues when
the different UDP streams must be processed and combined. The authors
investigated the use of XDP for processing these UDP streams, aggregating
them in the kernel and reporting only the final audio sample to the user
application. The authors found that XDP was not ideal, because of its lack of
floating-point operations and because it does not permit to retrieve hardware
timestamps. They were also limited by the incompatibility between LLVM, used
to compile the eBPF programs, and their build system, and could not
experiment on one part of their frontend. And although XDP increased the
performance, they realized that they could obtain similar speeds for their
use case with an optimized handling of a generic raw socket. Still, the use
case and experiment remain an interesting read.<br>
Video of the presentation may be available in the future from
<a href="https://lac2020.sciencesconf.org/">the page of the conference</a>, if it gets
uploaded.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/primer-how-xdp-and-ebpf-speed-network-traffic-via-the-linux-kernel/"><em>Primer: How XDP and eBPF Speed Network Traffic via the Linux Kernel</em></a>,
from Jack Wallen.<br>
There is a resolute focus on XDP in this article which describes how this
eBPF hook can speed up network traffic on Linux. This is followed by a simple
tutorial, where bcc is used to attach a XDP program and to track UDP packets
sent to a given port.</li>
<li><a href="https://nakryiko.com/posts/libbpf-bootstrap/"><em>Building BPF applications with libbpf-boostrap</em></a>,
from Andrii Nakryiko.<br>
You want to start developing an eBPF application, but you feel intimidated by
libbpf's complexity or lack of documentation? You <em>must</em> have a look at
libbpf-bootstrap. This project builds simple application templates, on which
you can directly build your software. Of the two available templates, the
simplest one (<code>minimal</code>) manipulates an eBPF program that simply logs the PID
of the process that calls it. The more advanced template (<code>bootstrap</code>) sets
up an application with more advanced features like eBPF maps, read-only
configuration variables, eBPF ring buffer, or CO-RE which needs a BTF (BPF
Type Format) description of the kernel's internals. This means that using
these features gets simple and immediate, all is set up for you in the
template. This article goes into a thorough description of the mechanisms
involved. This is a long read, but well worth it if you want to program
applications working with eBPF.</li>
<li><a href="https://pluginized-protocols.org/xbgp/2020/11/29/xbgp-hello.html"><em>A first xBGP plugin</em></a>,
from Thomas Wirtgen.<br>
As a follow-up from the link to the paper for xBGP in the previous issue of
these <em>eBPF Updates</em>, this is the introduction of a first eBPF-based xBGP
plugin. The idea is that, quoting the post, “<em>a network operator would like
to ignore the BGP UPDATE messages that contain an unknown attribute. A
practical example of this usage is when problems with the processing of BGP
Path attribute 128 caused the failure of BGP sessions</em>”. All steps required
for running this example are provided. The code is hosted on

TezEdge peer-to-peer nodes validate blocks for the decentralized

contracts. Blockchain networks are subject to DDoS (Distributed Denial of
Service) attacks, generally mitigated with a firewall. In the current case,
XDP is used to implement it. The eBPF program checks that each connection
starts with a valid and unique proof of work, making it expensive for an
adversary to start many connections. This is further integrated with the
“multipass validation” scheme that aims at detecting erroneous blocks as soon
as possible. Note that the eBPF programs are written in Rust.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Who I think CentOS Stream is and isn't for</h2>

	<p><small>December 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>As time goes by and <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/balancing-the-needs-around-the-centos-platform/">Red Hat people write more official posts</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qrtyaa/balancing_needs_around_centos_platform">via</a>), I've
grown some opinions on who it feels that CentOS Stream is for and
is not for. Since I also feel that Red Hat people are not being
<a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1340488916613390337">completely straightforward</a>, I am going to
write out my views, as an outsider to the CentOS project but someone who
uses CentOS (and Ubuntu LTS) and has in the past used RHEL.</p>

<p>If you want to see if your software will work with upcoming package
updates for the latest version of Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS Stream
is definitely for you. Giving people a preview of RHEL updates is
the expressed purpose of CS. You will not necessarily always be
able to build software for RHEL using CentOS Stream, because of
periodic ABI and API issues, but Red Hat will probably have a
solution for that at some point. CentOS Stream is also probably
for you if you operate RHEL systems and want some 'canary' ones
to see how future package updates are likely to affect you (and
if you see any new bugs or issues).</p>

<p>It's quite possible that for an open source project, using CentOS
Stream will also be the easiest way of testing if your software
(probably) works on the latest version of RHEL (at least in a fully
updated state). However, I'm not all that familiar with the options
Red Hat has here (such as their 'Universal Base Image'), and Red
Hat may introduce more in the future. If you're a commercial
company, <a href="https://centos.org/distro-faq/">the CentOS project distro FAQ</a>
makes it clear that Red Hat wants you to buy commercial RHEL licenses.</p>

<p>(Since CentOS Stream for 8 will end package updates in mid 2024,
open source projects who want to continue testing for RHEL 8 beyond
that point are going to have a problem. I expect that at least some
open source projects will simply drop official compatibility with
RHEL 8 at that point.)</p>

<p>If for some reason you want to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise,
CentOS Stream is also officially for you. The most likely case I
can imagine is that you use RHEL (or CentOS) and you have a bugfix
or small improvement that you want to push for and contribute, one
that Red Hat itself seems unlikely to take on. If you intend to
make larger contributions, I hope that you have a strong commercial
reason for helping a commercial company with its commercial product.</p>

<p>(To me, this raises significant questions about the future of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a>. However, Red Hat funds Fedora
too, so it could decide to work on funding EPEL should a supply of
outside volunteers start to dry up.)</p>

<p>If you want a free RPM based Linux distribution that probably has
a five-year support period, CentOS Stream may deliver what you're
looking for. Officially it's supposed to, at least at the moment,
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSStreamSuitability">but one can have concerns about the future</a>
and as far as I can tell this is not what CentOS Stream is 'supposed'
to be for, at least in the eyes of Red Hat (and Red Hat calls the
shots). <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Leap</a> is RPM based
and free, but <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime">it's only supported for 3 years</a>. Fedora, of course, is RPM based
and free but only supported for one year, with version to version
migration and an expectation that you'll always be on the most
current version.</p>

<p>If you want a well supported Linux distribution with an extremely
long support period and fast security updates, CentOS was never
really for you in the first place and CentOS Stream is worse (because
it definitely has no more than five years of package updates and
may have longer delays for security updates). In the past you could
press CentOS into service as such a thing and ignore, for example,
the delay between RHEL security updates and the rebuilt CentOS
security updates that corresponded to them, but you were always
accepting a compromise. Now that compromise has blown up on you,
although so far only for users of CentOS 8.</p>

<p>(CentOS currently says it will continue supporting CentOS 7 through
the end of life of RHEL 7 itself. Since Red Hat calls the shots, I
am not certain we should be as confident of that as we might have
been before.)</p>

<p>If you want a free version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the traditional
purpose of CentOS, Red Hat more or less says that CentOS Stream is
not for you. It is extremely likely that one goal of Red Hat's
management is to make it so that no such thing exists any more (and
certainly not one that they help pay for). At the moment the closest
you can probably come is Oracle Linux, which is also a rebuild of
RHEL, but that's if you're willing to put your trust in Oracle (many
people are not). It's possible that you can use CentOS Stream for
this anyway, but if a lot of people do so I expect Red Hat to take
additional steps to discourage this, such as by dropping 'CentOS
Stream for 8' support when RHEL 9 comes out (or even before then).</p>

<p>Since 'a free version of RHEL, including its long support period'
<a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1340488916613390337">was in fact what many people used CentOS for</a>, this
leaves a significant number of CentOS users without an obvious Linux
distribution to use at the moment, although options may well appear
in the future.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/OpenNebula/opennebula/latest" target="_blank">Terraform Provider for OpenNebula</a>—a Community initiative led by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.iguanesolutions.com/" target="_blank">Iguane Solutions</a> and <strong>OpenNebula Systems</strong>—was <a href="https://opennebula.io/terraform-provider-for-opennebula-now-officially-approved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially approved by HashiCorp</a>. A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions with the underlying infrastructure, in this case OpenNebula. The <strong>Provider Development Program</strong> allows vendors to build Terraform providers that are<strong> officially approved and tested by HashiCorp</strong>.</p>



<p>In mid-2020 we released a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/OpenNebula/terraform-provider-opennebula/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">second version</a> of the Terraform Provider, which included a number of interesting new features, including support for VM Groups and ACL, and enhancements like VM templates, tags, and timeout on some of those resources that can take a while to get ready (i.e. images and VMs). We discussed some of these back in July during an <strong>OpenNebula Webinar</strong> in which we participated along with <strong>Taylor Dolezal</strong> (Senior Developer Advocate at HashiCorp):</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, after several months of intense work, we are excited to announce the <strong>third version of the Terraform Provider for OpenNebula</strong>! 🚀 These are some of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenNebula/terraform-provider-opennebula/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvements</a> that this new version brings along:</p>



<p>New Resources:</p>



<ul><li>User management: creation, update and deletion.</li><li>Service management (<a href="https://docs.opennebula.io/5.12/advanced_components/application_flow_and_auto-scaling/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OneFlow</a>).</li></ul>



<p>Important improvements:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Attach / Detach NIC on a Virtual Machine</li><li>Attach / Detach Disk on a Virtual Machine</li><li>Resize a disk on a Virtual Machine</li><li>Add importer for Groups, Users and VDC</li></ul>



<p>As you see, this release is a <strong>huge step forward</strong> in making it easier for users to manage a running cluster. Until now, Terraform was really helpful for the deployment and deletion of a platform. However, updating running resources was still quite painful. Thanks to this new release, you can update running VMs without using Sunstone or CLI!</p>



<p>Kudos to all the people that made this new release possible! 👏</p>

Taxes are important tools for governments to reduce inequality. However, finding a tax policy that optimizes equality along with productivity is an unsolved problem. The AI Economist brings reinforcement learning (RL) to tax policy design for the first time to provide a purely simulation and data-driven solution. </li><li>The AI Economist uses a two-level RL framework (agents and tax policy) to learn dynamic tax policies in principled economic simulations. This framework does not use prior world knowledge or modeling assumptions, can directly optimize for any socioeconomic objective, and learns from observable data alone.</li><li>Our experiments show the AI Economist can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16%, compared to a prominent tax framework proposed by Emmanuel Saez, with even larger gains over an adaptation of the US Federal income tax and the free market. </li><li>Without endorsing this particular schedule, it is interesting that the AI Economist implements qualitatively different tax schedules than the baselines, with higher top tax rates and lower rates for middle incomes. Furthermore, it is robust in the face of emergent tax gaming strategies.</li><li>Moreover, the AI Economist is effective in simulations with human participants, achieving competitive equality-productivity trade-offs with the baselines and significantly higher income-weighted average social welfare. This suggests promise in using this approach to improve social outcomes in real economies.</li><li>Our vision for the AI Economist is to enable an objective study of policy impact on real-world economies, at a level of complexity that traditional economic research cannot easily address. We believe the intersection of machine learning and economics presents a wide range of exciting research directions, and gives ample opportunity for machine learning to have positive social impact.</li></ul><p>Our work fits within a larger context of recent advances in RL. RL has been used to train AIs to win competitive games, such as Go, Dota, and Starcraft. In those settings, the RL objective is inherently adversarial (â€œbeat-the-other-teamâ€�). Machine learning has also been used for the design of auction rules. In this work, we instead focus on the opportunity to use AI to promote social welfare through the design of optimal tax policies in dynamic economies.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

Taxes can help reduce inequality, but it is hard to find the optimal tax policy. Economic theory cannot fully model the complexities of the real world. Instead, tax theory relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example, about the effect of taxes on how much people work. Moreover, real-world experimentation with taxes is almost impossible.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>

Right: Taxes impact productivity (total income, represented by the area of the big squares), and equality (the relative difference in sizes of the smaller squares). In this illustration, the AI Economist achieves the best trade-off.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A prominent tax framework, proposed by Emmanuel Saez, derives a simple optimal tax formula. However, this formula requires knowing how labor responds to changes in tax rates (â€œelasticityâ€�) and makes strong assumptions, for example, that the economy is static and workers do not gain new skills. Other work has studied dynamic economic systems, but needs simplifying assumptions in order to attain analytical solutions.

There are two types of resources: wood and stone. Resources are scarce: they appear in the world at a limited rate. Workers move around, gather and trade resources, and earn income by building houses (this costs stone and wood). Houses block access: workers cannot move through the houses built by others.

Together, these economic factors and the various competitive drivers mean that workers need to be strategic in order to maximize their utility. </p><h3 id="emergent-specialization">Emergent Specialization</h3><p>Our economic simulation produces rich behavior when AI agents (the agents are the workers in the economy) learn to maximize their utility. A salient feature is specialization: AI agents with lower skill become <strong>gatherer-and-sellers </strong>and earn income by collecting and selling stone and wood. Agents with higher skill specialize as <strong>buyer-and-builders</strong> and purchase stone and wood in order to more quickly build houses. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/04/group-embed.svg"><figcaption>Top: The state of the simulation over the course of a single play-through.

Rather, specialization emerges because differently skilled workers learn to balance their income and effort. This demonstrates the richness of the economic simulation and builds trust that agents respond to economic drivers.

            <div>
              <div>
              <p>Haskell has a stigma of having poor or no documentation at all. Though more and more maintainers are doing a hell of a job to improve the quality of their libraries and applications, it is still not enough. We need to strengthen our vision of documentation collectively and as a consequence, master the existing tools for doing that.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">different types of documentation</a>. Today we want to talk about API and libraries documentation inside your library, and accordingly about Haskell gear for that – <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post is going to give Haddock overview, suggest documentation best practices, reveal the specialities of the Haddock tool, and show-and-tell lots of different examples of how to squeeze more out of your documentation. It should be interesting to library maintainers, developers who want to improve their documenting skills and everyone interested in documentation techniques in Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-haddock">What is Haddock<a href="#what-is-haddock">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Haddock is the Haskell way to document exposed API of your library or application. Writing special comments alongside your code helps to keep code and documentation synchronised and up-to-date (as outdated documentation is a painful problem to deal with). It also makes the docs comfy both for maintainers and users. And Haddock provides precisely that. Haskell is not always beginner-friendly, so giving a helping hand to users of your code in a convenient way is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>You write documentation using the special Haddock markup language right near the structures you want to document, and it can be rendered to different formats, including styled HTML, that could be viewable later on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a>, <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage</a> or even locally. Moreover, if you upload your library to Hackage or Stackage, <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> will search for definitions by name or type across all packages, including yours.</p>
<p>Here is how a typical Haddock documentation page for a module looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-membrain.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Module Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To produce the documentation, Haddock needs to build the project first because it uses build-time information. But you don’t need to worry about it usually, because build tools do that automatically when you ask them to output documentation.</p>

<p>Haddock is written in Haskell comments with the special annotations. There are two types of Haddock marked comments – <strong>pre-</strong> (starting with the <code>|</code> symbol) and <strong>post-comments</strong> (starting with the <code>^</code> symbol), which means that Haddock comments could be put right before or after the function/type/class definitions.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- | I am the 'foo' function's Haddock pre-comment.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>-- ^ I am the 'bar' function's Haddock post-comment</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For multi-line Haddock comments you can use either <strong>per-line</strong> or <strong>block</strong> style comments for both pre and post types. The special Haddock symbol needs to be added just to the first line of the multi-line comment, and Haddock will consume following lines until the first non-comment line.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- | This is multiline</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>-- per-line Haddock pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"></span>
<span id="cb2-5"></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span>bar ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- ^ Another per-line Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>-- post-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><span>{- | Multiline Haddock</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><span>block pre-comment</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb2-13"><span>baz ::</span> <span>Double</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you write multi-line comments in your code, we strongly advise using <strong>block</strong> comments by default over per-line ones because of the number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are fewer chances to lose part of your documentation due to the extra newline with multiline comments syntax, unlike per-line comments. Remember, that Haddock consumes comments marked as documentation until the first non-comment line, and a newline without <code>--</code> separates such comments into ordinary independent groups.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>-- | I am a normal line of documentation.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>-- I will be in the docs too.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span>-- I am not going to make it due to the missing @--@ in the previous line.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>foo ::</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>As a consequence, it’s impossible to have conditional documentation chunks under the <a href="https://guide.aelve.com/haskell/cpp-vww0qd72">C Preprocessor (CPP)</a> pragmas when using the <code>--</code> style of comments, as CPP pragmas are stripped to empty lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiline comments contain less noise (no <code>--</code> on each line), making it easier to read and update.</p></li>
<li><p>They are more suitable for inserting/copying/updating code snippets quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>They also occupy less space horizontally on average, because you don’t waste 3 characters on each line.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-be-documented">What can be documented<a href="#what-can-be-documented">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Generally, Haddock documents the exposed API of your Haskell libraries and applications.</p>
<p>More specifically, Haddock can be applied to document the following parts of the Haskell code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top-level module headers</li>
<li>Type definitions: <code>data</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>newtype</code></li>
<li>Constructors and fields</li>
<li>Typeclasses — <code>class</code> declarations</li>
<li>Typeclasses methods</li>
<li>Instances</li>
<li>Derived typeclasses</li>
<li>Top-level functions</li>
<li>Arguments and return results of functions</li>
<li>More exotic top-level definitions: <code>pattern</code>, <code>type family</code>, <code>data family</code>, <code>type instance</code> and <code>data instance</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The below example showcases some Haddock syntax and features:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>{- | Our example sum type.</span></span>

<span id="cb4-47">    <span>getChar</span> (<span>CharCode</span> _ c) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When documentation is built, it will look like on the screenshot below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-overall-example.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Overall Example</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr>
<p>We don’t recommend using the Haddock comment syntax for other places where they cannot be applied by specification because this breaks Haddock. Even though the documentation states that such comments should be ignored, it is not what you would get on the output.</p>
<p>For example, the following innocent-looking Haddock results in the documentation error:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Haddock coverage:

src/BlogpostHaddock.hs:57:10: error:
    parse error on input '-- ^ The answer'
   |
57 | var = 42 -- ^ The answer
   |          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>This issue will prevent the documentation appearing at Hackage and Stackage, which means that users won’t be able to read package documentation easily or search by the package in Hoogle.</p>
<p>Correct documentation looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-- ^ The answer</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you wanted to leave an ordinary (non-documentation) comment:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>var ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2">var <span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>-- The answer</span></span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>We are not going to cover all annotation syntax. You can learn more from the <a href="https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">official documentation</a>. Instead, we will try to focus on best practices, advice and more explanation of suitability and usability of some various pieces of documentation on different levels.</p>
<h2 id="haddock-fishing">Haddock Fishing<a href="#haddock-fishing">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As most of us are looking at the libraries’ documentation through Hackage/Stackage/Haddock or local options of the same format, we are going to cover each layer of the documentation on the page piece by piece from top to bottom and see how we can use 100% of each element.</p>
<p>Every page is responsible for one Haskell module and correspondingly reflects its structure, though in a user-configurable way (we will cover later the ways to take control over that). So, with respect to that, let’s start diving into the meaning of each and every documentation piece.</p>
<div>
<p>Though, sometimes you are interested only in specific types and functions, not in reading the full documentation. Hackage helps here as well. You can press the <kbd>s</kbd> button on a package page to quickly jump to definitions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-relude-search.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock Search Example</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<h3 id="top-level">Top Level<a href="#top-level">🔗</a></h3>
<p>First thing you see on the module documentation page is this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/haddock/haddock-top-level-header.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haddock top-level header</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This whole information is taken from the top-level Haddock comment for the module. The comment is attached to the <code>module</code> construction in the source file. You can put extensions (<code>{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}</code>) and options (e.g.&nbsp;<code>{-# OPTIONS_GHC ... #-}</code>) either <em>before</em> the module header comment or <em>after</em>, but we recommend putting module Haddock comment closer to the module keyword itself, <strong>after</strong> all language extensions and module-specific options.</p>
<p>So the module layout may look like this:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications    #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>{- | ... Module header comment</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>-}</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><span>module</span> <span>MyModule</span> (<span>...</span>) <span>where</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>The meta-information in the border to the right is the result of special annotations at the beginning of the top-level Haddock. If it isn’t present in the file, then none will be shown in there (except for automatically determined info by the tool you are using).</p>
<p>These annotations include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Module</code> – Module name</li>
<li><code>Description</code> – Short description</li>
<li><code>Copyright</code> – Copyright note (preserves newlines)</li>
<li><code>License</code> or <code>Licence</code> or <code>SPDX-License-Identifier</code> – the name of the license used in the project</li>
<li><code>Maintainer</code> – information about current maintainer, can include email</li>
<li><code>Stability</code> – <em>experimental</em> or <em>stable</em></li>
<li><code>Portability</code> – <em>portable</em> or <em>non-portable</em>, but you can put anything basically. This field meaning is not strictly defined. Some people use it for OS-portability and write something like POSIX, Windows, portable. Other people mean “the Haskell compiler according to standard portability” and put “non-portable” here if a module uses GHC-only extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Auto-filled, no manual fill-in is possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Safe Haskell</code> – <code>Safe</code>, <code>Trustworthy</code>, <code>Unsafe</code> or <code>None</code> (default)</li>
<li><code>Language</code> – Haskell report: 98 or 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the fields are optional, in free format and don’t have any requirements. Adding this header to each module is advisable.</p>

         <p> 特斯拉最大勁敵來了，蘋果首款電動車「Apple Car」將提前問世。供應鏈透露，蘋果比照iPhone備料由零組件開始催貨的慣例，近期向和大（1536）、貿聯-KY、和勤、富田等台灣汽車零組件廠提出備貨要求，將相關業者入列首波供應鏈。</p>
         <!--1-->
         
         <p> 台灣關鍵供應鏈證實，蘋果預計明年9月發表Apple Car，比原先規劃提早至少兩年，其原型車已經在美國加州上路測試，因應Apple Car拉貨需求，和大、貿聯等台廠忙翻天，全面爆單。 </p>

         <p> 儘管遭點名的台廠都相當低調，但近期已有不少國內汽車零組件廠開始「動起來」，透露Apple Car大單將至的訊息。其中，和大位於嘉義大埔美園區的新廠，正加速AI智能化產線布建，明年第2季將可新增六條產線投產。</p>
         <!--3-->
         
         <p> 和勤也積極進行兩岸擴產，台灣全興廠預計年底完成搬遷及量產，嘉興和新廠第五車間擴廠訂明年第2季完成搬遷。</p>
         <!--4-->
         
         <p> 富田位於銅鑼的二期廠預計明年投產，一、二期廠電動車動力馬達零組件產能，可由目前的每年40萬套，一舉拉升至100萬套，動力集成系統則增至40萬套以上。</p>
         <!--5-->
         
         <p> 業界指出，除了電動車龍頭特斯拉之外，國內電動車供應鏈最近出現一個新的發燒名詞「美國雙A」，積極向台廠下單。</p>
         <!--6-->
         
         <p> 儘管供應鏈廠商都簽署保密協定，不願透露細節，但知情的業者坦言，「美國雙A」指的就是蘋果（Apple）與亞馬遜（Amazon）兩家廠商，業者暱稱為「一個大A，一個小A」。</p>
         <!--7-->
         
         <p> 蘋果對電動車的進度始終秘而不宣，外界原本預期，至少到2023年才會發表Apple Car。不過，國內供應鏈大廠董座直言，客戶規劃Apple Car明年9月將發表；另外，亞馬遜與Rivian合作的電動貨卡車，明年8月搶先問世，關鍵供應鏈也都是台廠。</p>
         <!--8-->
         
         <p> 電動車供應鏈大廠高層透露，隨著訂單出貨、組裝完成，Apple Car首款原型車，已有數十輛秘密在美國加州上路測試中，預料放量出貨與商機效益明年發酵，2022年全面爆發。</p>
         <!--9-->
         
         <p> 另外，電動車新創公司Rivian，去年獲得亞馬遜10萬輛電動貨車訂單，雙方密切研發客製化純電小貨車，相關零組件也是倚靠台灣供應鏈，新車預計明年8月在美國上路，2022年在全球開始服務。</p>
         <!--10-->
         
         <p> 據了解，配合特斯拉增產，以及「美國雙A」等新客戶的加入，國內主要電動車供應鏈包括和大、貿聯、和勤、富田等都出現「爆單」的情形，並積極擴廠、擴產。</p>
         <!--11-->
         
         <p> 值得注意的是，上銀集團也加速布局電動車領域，目前正與歐洲及中國大陸電動車零件大廠洽談客製化智慧滾珠螺桿，最快明年底前開始出貨，主要用於電動車轉向與剎車系統。</p>

<p>VPNs, firewalls, jump hosts, and other networking components have been fundamental in managing permissioned access to company resources like servers, databases, internal applications, and more. But as cloud computing has matured, these resources have become widely decentralized, and the IT stack compartmentalized and abstracted.</p>

<p>As compute resources change dynamically and communicate via public networks, the current implementation of access controls and policy enforcement is becoming an increasingly inexact science. This whitepaper takes a deep look at these trends, the challenges posed by relying on a purely networking-based security policy, and how to reframe this problem in a realistic light. Distilled into key principles used by engineers from small startups to Fortune 5 companies, these four practices provide a strong framework in reconsidering how companies authenticate and authorize users access to critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>…will prepare organizations to secure infrastructure, meet compliance requirements, reduce operational overhead, and get better visibility into user behavior.</p>

    <p>There seems to exist a database for every niche, mood or emotion. And they seem to change just as fast.</p>

<p>How do you balance the urge for the new and shiny but without risking too much headache down the road?</p>

<p>This post is an attempt to lay out the rough landscape of databases that you might encounter or consider as of late 2020.</p>

<p>There will be broad generalizations for brevity.</p>

<p>The goal is not to be exhaustive or take all possible precautions. Consider it a starting point for further research and planning.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a consultant doing development, DevOps and cloud infrastructure. I also have the occasional side project trying out the Tech Flavor of the Month.</p>


<h2 id="project-phase-overview">Project phase overview</h2>
<p>The typical phases in projects Iâ€™m involved in follow no scientific or trademarked methodology, so YMMV:</p>

<h3 id="starting-out">Starting out</h3>

<p>Get something working as fast as possible. Take all the shortcuts. Use some opinionated framework or platform.</p>

<h3 id="moving-from-development-to-production">Moving from development to production</h3>

<p>People like it, people use it. Move the thing from a single â€œpet serverâ€� to a more robust cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="scaling-production">Scaling production</h3>

<p>Bottlenecks and scaling problems start to emerge. Refactor or replace some pieces to remove the bottlenecks.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>Moving between these phases might be a major PITA if the wrong shortcuts were taken in the previous phases.</p>

<p><em>This of course applies to all technology choices and not just databases. But we have to start somewhere, right?</em></p>




<p>When starting out I try to envision all the phases of the project and which directions it may take in the future.</p>

<p>First I want the technology or software I choose to be instantly usable. A Docker image. Great. An <code>apt-get install</code>. Sweet. <code>npm install</code>. Sure, why not. Downloading a tarball. Installing some C dependencies. Setting some flags. Compiling. Symlinking and fixing permissions. Creating some configuration from scratch. Making my own systemd service definitions. Going back and doing every step again because it failed. <em>Mkay, no thanks, Iâ€™m out.</em></p>

<p>At least for me itâ€™s a plus if itâ€™s easy to deploy on Kubernetes since I use it for everything already. I always have a cluster or three laying around so I can get a prototype or five up and running quickly before later spending money for cloud hosting.</p>

<p>Does the thing have momentum and a community? If it does it probably has high quality tooling either by the vendor or the open source community (preferably both). It probably also has lots of common questions answered on blogs and StackOverflow and Github issues.</p>

<p><strong>So we managed to build something and the audience likes it.</strong></p>

<p>How easy is it to move it from a production environment into something stable and low-maintenance? For databases that would typically involve using a managed service for hosting it. You do not want to be responsible for operating your own databases. Is it common enough that there are competitors in the marketplace offering it as a managed service? If there is only a single option expect prices to be very steep. Preferably also a managed service by one of the big known cloud platforms. They are usually cheaper. They are less likely to vanish. It might make integration with other systems easier later.</p>

<p><strong>We hit some problems either because of raw scale or some type of usage we did not anticipate in the beginning.</strong></p>

<p>Are there compatible implementations that might solve some common problems? Typically this is because an implementation has to make a decision about itâ€™s trade-offs. For a database system this is usually around the CAP theorem. A database system (or anything that keeps state) can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Partition Tolerant</em> - The system still works if a node or the network between nodes fail.</li>
  <li><em>Available</em> - All requests receive a response.</li>
  <li><em>Consistent</em> - The data we read is the current data and not an earlier state.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, you can only have two at the same time. And distributed systems tends to need to be partition tolerant. So we are stuck between consistency and availability.</p>

<p>It might be a good to have an idea of the CAP tradeoffs an implementation has done, and whether there are compatible implementations with different tradeoffs that can be used if later we find out we need to tweak our trade-offs for speed and/or scale.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>More information about CAP theorem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">here</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/cap-theorem-and-distributed-database-management-systems-5c2be977950e">here</a>. Jepsen have also <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses">extensively tested</a> many popular databases to see how they break and if they are true to their stated trade-offs.</em></p>
</blockquote>


<h2 id="database-categories">Database categories</h2>

<p>Databases can be roughly sorted into categories. Iâ€™ll keep it simple and use the everyday lingo and not go into details about semantics and definitions (forgive me).</p>

<p>https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/intro/comparing-database-types</p>


<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>

<p>The oldest category is the relational database, also known as SQL based on the typical interface used to access these databases.</p>

<p>In general these databases have tables with names, a set of pre-defined columns and an arbitrary number of rows. You should have an idea of the data types to be stored in each column (such as text or numbers).</p>

<p>The downside of this is that you have to start with a rough model of the data you want to store and work with. The benefit of this is that later you know something about the model of the data you are working with. Most of the time Iâ€™ll happily do this in the database rather than handle all the potential inconsistencies in all systems that use that database.</p>

<p><em>Main contenders: PostgreSQL. MySQL &amp; MariaDB.</em></p>


<h3 id="nosql">NoSQL</h3>

<p>All the rage the last decade. You put data in you get data out. The data is structured but not necessarily predefined. Think JSON object with values, arrays and lists.</p>

<p>The benefit is productivity when developing. The drawback is that you may pay a price for those shortcuts later if youâ€™re not careful.</p>

<p><em>Main contender: MongoDB.</em></p>


<h3 id="keyvalue">KeyValue</h3>

<p>Technically a sub-category of NoSQL, and should probably be called caches. But I feel it deserves itâ€™s own category.</p>

<p>A hyper-fast hyper-simple type of database. It has two columns. A key (ID) and value. The value can be anything, a string, a number, an entire JSON object or a blob containing binary data.</p>

<p>These are typically used in combination with another type of database. Either by storing very commonly used data for even quicker access. Or for certain types of simple data that requires insane speed or throughput and you donâ€™t want to overload the main database.</p>

<p><em>Main contender: Redis.</em></p>


<h3 id="timeseries">Timeseries</h3>

<p>A lesser known type of database optimized for storing a time series. A time series is a specific data type where the index is typically the time of a measurement. And the measurement is a number.</p>

<p>A time series is almost never changed after the fact. So these databases can be optimized for writing huge amounts of new data and reading and calculating on existing data. At the cost of performance for deleting or updating old data which is sloooow. Since the values are always numbers that tend to change somewhat predictably compression and deduplication can save us massive amounts of storage.</p>

<p><em>Main contenders: Prometheus, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB (plugin for PostgreSQL).</em></p>


<h3 id="graph">Graph</h3>

<p>Graph databases are cool. In a graph database the relationship between objects is a primary feature. Whereas in SQL you need to join an element from one table with another object in another table with some kind of common identifier.</p>

<p>For most simple use cases a regular SQL database will do fine. But when the number of objects stored (rows) and the number of intermediary tables (joins) become large it gets slow, or expensive, or both.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have much experience with graph databases but I suspect they are less suited to general tasks and should be reserved for solving specific problems.</p>

<p><em>Main contenders: Neo4j. Redis + RedisGraph.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PS: Graph databases and GraphQL are completely separate things.</p>
</blockquote>


<h3 id="other-nice-things">Other nice things</h3>

<p>When researching this post Iâ€™ve come across things that look promising but are hard to categorize or fall in their own very niche categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dgraph.io/">Dgraph</a> - A GraphQL and backend in one.</li>
  <li><a href="https://prestodb.io/">PrestoDB</a> - An SQL interface on top of whatever database or storage you want to connect.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> - A NoSQL database focused on real-time streaming/updating clients.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB</a> - A transactional key-value store by Apple.</li>
  <li><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse</a> - An SQL database that stores data (on disk) in columns instead of rows. Makes for blazingly fast analytical and aggregation queries.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/">Amazon Quantum Ledger Database</a> - A managed distributed ledger database (aka blockchain).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/edb-postgres-advanced-server-secure-ha-oracle-compatible">EDB Postgres Advanced Server</a> - An Oracle compatible PostgreSQL variant.</li>
</ul>




<p><em>How to use these maps:</em></p>

<p>Version compatibility are in parenthesis. I have not mapped every version and how much breaking they are compared to previous versions but included some notes where I know there might be issues.</p>

<p><em>API/Protocol/Interface</em> - This is decided by the framework, tool or driver you want to use. Sometimes it might be easier to choose the framework first and then a fitting database protocol. Or you might be lucky to choose the database features you need first and then select frameworks, tools and drivers that support it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think interfaces are really important when creating and choosing technology. I had a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stianovrevage/avoiding-lock-in-without-avoiding-managed-services">presentation</a> about it a while ago and I think itâ€™s still relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Engine</em> - Database implementations that are independent but try to be compatible. If there are alternatives to the â€œoriginalâ€� implementation they might have done different tradeoffs with regards to the CAP theorem or solve other specific problems.</p>

<p><em>Big three managed</em> - Available managed services by the big three clouds, Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP) or Microsoft (Azure). Having an option to host in the big three is most likely the cheapest method as well as having a variety …</p></div></div>

<p>Such are images of hope: Nurses getting vaccinated. Pallets of packaged vaccines distributed on special flights. Mayors exulting over "the beginning of the end of the pandemic.” A president who is preparing the country for better times.</p>


<div>
<p>These images are from the United States.</p><p>In Germany, on the other hand, you see desolate shopping streets, shuttered restaurants and a government that is preparing its population for long, dark days.</p><p>The contrast is unmistakable. On the one hand, there is the supposedly incompetent Trump administration, which will provide vaccines to 20 million Americans in the next two to three weeks alone. By the end of March, the plan is for around 100 million Americans to have received the two vaccine injections they need.</p><p>On the other hand, there is the supposedly well-prepared Europeans, who continue to have to wait for a vaccine that was developed in Germany. And who still don’t know exactly how much of the vaccine they will be getting in the coming months.</p>
</div>

<p>Initially, Germany’s health minister has announced, there will probably only be 400,000 vaccine doses for Germany, with another 11 to 13 million to follow by March -- a fraction of the amount the Americans are getting.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<p>It’s a politically dangerous situation that has now been recognized by the German government. Since last week, it has been taking hectic countermeasures. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) now wants to approve the vaccine a week earlier than planned, and vaccinations are slated to begin in Europe on Dec. 27. Negotiations are also underway with manufacturers to obtain more doses. On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel even spoke with BioNTech founders Özlem Türeci and Uğur Șahin in a livestream, part of which was broadcast publicly. The message couldn’t be any clearer: Vaccination is now the chancellor’s business.</p>

<div>
<p>That realization has come too late, however. For months, it has been clear that other countries would have more doses of the vaccine, would start vaccinating sooner and, as a result, would be able to take more effective action against the pandemic.</p><p>But in Berlin and at European Union headquarters in Brussels, too little action was taken for too long, and it was often justified with complacent arguments: In Europe, medicines are tested better and more precisely than elsewhere in the world, and vaccines are available in abundance thanks to good planning. Health Minister Jens Spahn announced that the critical mass of around 60 percent of the German population could be vaccinated.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Too Little, Too Late</h3><p>But, so far at least, his optimism hasn’t been matched by reality.</p><p>And the late approval of the active ingredient in the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) appears to be the least of the problems. The bigger issue is that if the situation remains as it is now, there will not be enough vaccine available to get the pandemic under control in Germany before next autumn. The EU appears to have bought too little, too late and at times from the wrong producers. And it appears that it turned down hundreds of millions of vaccine doses that are now lacking.</p><p>Dramatic consequences are brewing for the German government: Without being able to vaccinate on a broad scale, the country won’t be able to stop the virus. Which means that the fall and winter of 2021 could be similar to this year, with high infection rates, contact restrictions and lockdowns. The only remedy would be a massive increase in the number of vaccines that are approved for use.</p><p>But Berlin has made an uncompromising commitment to European solidarity on the vaccination issue. And that means it’s not only the influential and economically strong member states that will have access, but also smaller countries like Romania and Slovenia. If Germany were to go out on its own and buy up vaccine doses that are in short supply, it would massively threaten cohesion in a Europe that is already fragile.</p><p>At the same time, though, the German federal government has an obligation to do all it can to protect its people.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Scientists estimate that 60 to 70 percent of Germany’s population would need to be vaccinated in order to stop the virus. That would require 100 to 120 million doses because, with one exception, all the vaccines currently available have to be administered in two doses before they deliver immunity.</p><p>The EU has ordered a total of 1.3 billion doses from six different manufacturers. Germany is entitled to 18.6 percent of those doses in a distribution mechanism calculated according to its share of the EU population. That amounts to around 250 million doses. But the number is misleading.</p><p>Currently, the only deliveries that are certain are those from German-American consortium BioNTech/Pfizer and the American biotech company Moderna.</p><p>BioNTech, whose vaccine is to be approved by the EU on Dec. 21, will be able to supply around 45 million doses to Germany in the first half of the year, according to current estimates. Moderna, whose vaccine is due to be authorized for use in Europe on Jan. 6, could supply around 15 million doses. Together, that’s a total of 60 million doses, which is far too little.</p><h3>But When?</h3><p>Additional supplies are to come from four other producers with whom the EU has contracts. But it remains highly uncertain when they will be able to deliver. No matter what happens, no significant quantities are expected before the summer.</p><p>The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca had to interrupt its vaccine trial and delivered disappointing testing data. French company Sanofi has postponed possible approval for its vaccine candidate to the end of 2021. Meanwhile, the vaccine from CureVac, based in Tübingen, Germany, isn’t expected until this summer. The only company that is close to delivering another vaccine candidate is Johnson &amp; Johnson in the U.S., and it isn’t expected until March.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Of course, not all of these developments could have been foreseen. The U.S., for example, believed that Sanofi would be quicker in delivering its vaccine. Still, the procurement of vaccines in Europe has been a bumpy road from the start.</p><p>Germany initiated a small vaccine alliance in the spring together with France, Italy and the Netherlands. In a first step, they reached an agreement with AstraZeneca for 400 million doses. The move was primarily intended as a means of exerting pressure because there wasn’t enough happening in Brussels. "Many countries around the world have already secured vaccines, but Europe hasn’t yet,” Health Minister Spahn warned at the time.</p><p>In mid-June, the European Commission subsequently presented an EU vaccine strategy to "ensure fair and equitable access for all across the EU.” Sufficient supplies for the member states were to be ensured by providing purchasing guarantees to manufacturers.</p><p>Health care is actually one of the competencies that is reserved for the member states in the EU. But the vaccine supply was meant to serve as a symbol of solidarity in contrast to the U.S., where Donald Trump was propagating his "America First” stance and fueling merciless global competition for the coveted vaccines.</p><p>Between August and October, the EU concluded the first of its contracts: with the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. Even at the time, though, it was conspicuous that the companies with the most promising vaccine candidates were not given firm contracts. BioNTech and Moderna had already obtained promising results from their studies in July and were entering the home stretch.</p><h3>No Comment</h3><p>Behind the scenes, this was the source of anger and irritation within government circles in Berlin. The irritation grew significantly in November, when the companies published data that their vaccine candidates are each up to 95 percent effective.</p><p>The manufacturers have repeatedly made it clear that they intend to distribute the vaccine according to two criteria: population size and when the contract was signed.</p><p>Way back in July, the U.S. secured 600 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine and 500 million doses from Moderna. Japan, Canada, Hong Kong and others signed contracts in the summer and autumn. The EU only reserved doses. It didn’t place concrete orders until mid-November. And even then, it ordered far less than it could have.</p>

<p>The EU only secured 200 million doses from BioNTech, with an option for 100 million more that would be manufactured later. According to sources with knowledge of the negotiations, BioNTech had additional capacity and apparently offered that capacity to the EU: up to 500 million doses in the first round.</p><p>But the European Commission reportedly rejected the offer. European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides would not comment on the exact reason. "We do not comment on the progress of negotiations," a commission spokesman said.</p><p>Why were only 300 million doses of a vaccine secured that had already demonstrated 95 percent efficacy in clinical trials at the time? One that had been hailed as a sensation and was already on its way to regulatory approval? German Health Minister Spahn pushed for more to be purchased, but he failed to prevail in the end due to opposition from several EU member countries -- in part, apparently, because the EU had ordered only 300 million doses from the French company Sanofi. "That’s why buying more from a German company wasn't in the cards,” says one insider familiar with the negotiations. The European Commission has denied that version of events,&nbsp;saying it isn’t true that Paris took massive steps to protect Sanofi.</p>

After all, Jupiter and Saturn influenced Earth’s growth and evolution. Evidence suggests there were at least three occasions on which they (Jupiter especially) chose Earth’s evolutionary path, some 4.5 billion years ago, helping to shape the planet we know and love today.</p><p>The wee infant Earth was just sitting there growing<span><br></span>Some rocky things flying by, crashing and glowing.<span><br></span>But far from the Sun, way out in the cold<span><br></span>The giants were stirring. A force to behold!<sup>3</sup></p><p>Planets grow within swirling disks of gas and dust around young stars. We have images of these disks taken with our biggest telescopes, especially the giant radio telescope ALMA. Here is one of ALMA’s classics:</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18046_4fea1a6421a72296a12cd7898b93858e.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>ALMA image of the planet-forming disk around the nearby star TW Hydrae. The disk as a whole is similar in size to the solar system, and the inner hole in the inset is about the size of Earth’s orbit.</i></span><span>S. Andrews (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA), ALMA (ESO / NAOJ / NRAO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter starved the growing Earth. This may sound like a bad thing, but without Jupiter, Earth would probably have become a colossal “super-Earth” and moved inward, onto a roasting-hot orbit close to the Sun. Not great for life.</p><p>Planets grow out of dust. It drifts around in a disk, then piles up to form 100 kilometer-scale “planetesimals,” the real building blocks of the planets. Think of these like the potato-shaped asteroids from <i><a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-emodiversity-of-star-wars" target="_blank">Star Wars</a></i>—just bigger, farther apart, and without the giant space slugs. The rings in the ALMA image are pile-ups of sand-sized dust, where these objects may be forming right now.</p><p>Planetesimals grow further by bashing into each other, and also by sweeping up dust drifting inward. When a growing planetesimal gets massive enough, it blocks the drifting dust, not only starving itself but also blocking the dust from getting to any planetesimal closer to the Sun. These planetesimals can keep growing by self-collisions but not by any new dust originating in the outer solar system.</p><p>Jupiter’s growing core—a super-big planetesimal about ten times the mass of Earth—may have done exactly that. It grew big enough, fast enough, to stop the flow of dust. Scientists don’t know exactly why Jupiter’s core formed so much faster than Earth’s, but the reason likely has something to do with the fact that Jupiter started forming further from the Sun, where (sticky) ices could exist and contribute to its growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Meteorites corroborate this idea. The thousands of meteorites in NASA <a href="https://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/astromaterials3d/" target="_blank">collections</a> can be divided into two main classes, based on their isotopes—the relative amounts of the same elements with different numbers of neutrons. These meteorites are made out of dust that’s just the right size to drift really fast within the disk. Yet the two types of meteorites didn’t mix. Why not? Jupiter’s dust-blocking core.</p><p>Our system was neatly just sliced right in two<span><br></span>As Jupiter’s core stopped the dust flowing through.<span><br></span>If not for this, Earth would have just kept on growing <span><br></span>And wound up so close to the Sun we’d be glowing!</p><p>Jupiter and Saturn also stunted Mars’ growth. The Red Planet gets a lot of press, but it’s a runt. Mars is nine times less massive than its closest neighbor, Earth. Decades of computer simulations (starting in the late 1970s) have shown that, without an outside perturbation, Mars would have grown to be about as big as Earth—even with Jupiter blocking the flow of dust into the inner solar system.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18039_62b4521aec8fe13ad75560a2b41b2f95.jpg" width="733" alt=""></figure><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18040_152c97a9bb6f2ababc2c73a46cfef7a3.jpg" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>The actual inner solar system (top), and what the inner solar system would look like today if not for a strong outside perturbation during the planets’ growth (bottom; according to computer simulations).</i></span><span>planetplanet.net</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why isn’t Mars bigger? There are a few different ideas out there. One scenario—called the <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2013/08/02/the-grand-tack/" target="_blank">Grand Tack</a>—has Jupiter’s orbit shifting, or “migrating,” as it grew. On its own, Jupiter would have migrated inward and probably ended up somewhere close to Earth’s orbit, which is where most of the Jupiter-mass planets around other stars are found.</p><p>This is where Saturn comes in. Jupiter and Saturn together migrate outward instead of inward. This is a neat hydrodynamical effect that takes place when two gas giants are close to each other in the same disk, and the inner one is more massive than the outer one. The flow of gas changes and creates a pileup interior to the inner planet’s orbit, which acts to push both planets outward. Like two good friends, they have the wherewithal to go against the flow and migrate outward together, whereas each would migrate inward on its own.</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18041_a4396f61160d9bfa1ea9114dacd37247.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>A hydrodynamical simulation of Jupiter and Saturn (circled) migrating in the sun’s disk.</i></span><span>Arnaud Pierens</span></figcaption></figure><p>Jupiter and Saturn’s migration emptied out Mars’ feeding zone, stunting its growth. As long as their migration turned around (“tacked” in sailing jargon) early enough, the gas giants would not have disrupted Earth’s growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Like dinosaurs, Saturn and Jupiter roamed<span><br></span>They sculpted this system that humans call home<span><br></span>Their orbits first shrank, then shifted and grew.<span><br></span>Our Earth was constructed from rocks they plowed through.</p><p>We may be observing something similar in another system almost 400 light-years away. The disk around the star PDS70 appears to be shaped by two giant baby planets, locked in an orbital resonance, and migrating around right now!&nbsp;</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18042_7e132d103ce54fda527e88a13a3d1540.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Artist’s impression of the exoplanets PDS70 b and c as they are migrating around within their birth disk.</i></span><span>J. Olmsted (StSci)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The gas giants eventually became unstable, pelting all of the other, more inner planets with stray rocks and ice. There are several pieces of circumstantial evidence leading scientists to suspect that our solar system suffered a dynamical instability, an event during which the giant planets’ orbits changed in sudden, dramatic fashion. For instance, the giant planets’ orbits are not circles, but modestly stretched out ellipses. The Kuiper belt is almost empty, yet Pluto and Eris, another dwarf planet (discovered in 2005), needed a lot more mass to grow as big as they are. The giant planets are surrounded by clouds of “irregular satellites” that seem to have been captured from somewhere else. The orbits of Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids are strangely tilted. The list goes on.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model" target="_blank">Nice model</a>, a scenario of how our solar system dynamically evolved, developed in the French city of the same name, proposes that the giant planets’ orbits went unstable hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (more on that later). The instability may looked something like this:&nbsp;</p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18043_877d85181eb41f6b8db45bd2d29a97b4.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Snapshots of the giant planet’s instability (from a computer simulation). The colored lines represent the orbits of the giant planets, and the white dots are leftover planetesimals.</i></span><span>Gomes et al. 2005 / Wikicommons</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the instability, the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, were kicked all over the place. The outer disk of planetesimals—basically, a huge pile of leftover comets—was almost completely cleared out. Those leftovers rained down on the planets and a few were captured (like the irregular satellites).</p><p>And later on there was a big instability<span><br></span>This time the giants expressed their hostility<span><br></span>The ice giants’ orbits were strongly affected<span><br></span>An extra one may have been fully ejected!<span><br></span>(The Earth was bombarded; no planet protected.)</p><p>There is a new twist in this story related to the timing of these events. As you know, the Moon is covered in craters. Since the 1970s, the ages of craters were thought to show a big spike in the rate of impacts hundreds of millions of years after the planets formed (remember, that was still billions of years ago). This was called the “late heavy bombardment.”&nbsp;</p><p>New analysis shows that this spike is probably just the tail end of an early bombardment, the one that grew the planets in the first place. Not a “late” heavy bombardment. This doesn’t call the past instability into question, because it can explain so many features of the solar system at the same time. But it must have happened much earlier, maybe during the growth of the rocky planets. There’s a cherry on top: New simulations show that an early giant-planet instability can even <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2018/05/29/mars-growth-stunted/" target="_blank">explain</a> why Mars is smaller than Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>In modeling events billions of years ago, we are really only constrained by two things: the laws of physics (and available evidence) and our imaginations.</p><p>We don’t have a time machine, can’t see the past<span><br></span>But models can answer some questions we’ve asked<span><br></span>To test our ideas, we use simulations<span><br></span>On giant computers, with huge calculations.</p><p>Some people like to call Jupiter and Saturn the “architects” of the solar system, as though they had a clear plan for how our system should turn out. Not us. We think of the gas giants as bullies that pushed Earth around and made a lot of decisions for us.</p><p>Some even call Jupiter Earth’s “protector.” This is because, over the past 4 billion years, its massive gravity has scattered comets and asteroids away that might otherwise have hit our planet. But on closer inspection, this doesn’t hold up. Jupiter only protects Earth from comets that Jupiter put on Earth-crossing orbits in the first place. It’s like a bully—albeit, quite a beautiful one—asking for a handout to protect you from his fist.</p><p><i>Sean Raymond is an American astrophysicist working at the Bordeaux Astrophysical Laboratory in France.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p><em>By <a href="https://twitter.com/javisantana">Javi Santana</a></em></p> <p>One month before Black Friday, one of our clients in the retail space asked us to host for them the real time analytics API that feeds the dashboards that everyone in the company uses to see what’s going on (and of course, make decisions based on it).</p> <p>We knew it was tight but we specialize in running real-time stuff at scale: for example, while at Carto we served the Wall Street Journal frontpage map on 2012 during the election night, we hosted a website with a link from google.com’s home page (and a bunch of other countries) for 24 hours and some other high load events.</p> <p>In an ideal world you would setup a Kafka cluster, a streaming system to materialize some metrics on some fast key value store like redis and serve them using a lightweight backend through an API. With that you would get likely thousands of requests per second without much hardware.</p> <p>And while we can easily ingest Kafka streams, not every company works with streams, not all analytics can be precalculated easily and not all dashboards are simple counters.</p> <p>In this case we had to deal with data from a transactional database. And the analytics needed to be flexible due to filtering requirements as well as different configurations that needed to be changed on the fly and reflected instantly on the dashboard.</p> <h2 id="the-data-input">The data input</h2> <p>In order to “stream” data from the transactional database to our system, the client set up 5 parallel threads sending once per second all the rows that changed during the last second. Sounds easy but it gets complicated - wait for it.</p> <p>That means that even when just a column changes in an already existing row, the row needs to be sent again. And in a system like this, rows change quite a lot. Of course there are better ways to do this but for the use case it was good enough and allowed them to have high quality data (one of the requirements of the project)</p> <h2 id="the-infrastructure">The infrastructure</h2> <p>We used our product for the setup. It looks like:</p> <ul> <li>An Nginx load balancer</li> <li>A Varnish behind Nginx</li> <li>Our Tinybird backend. It runs the API endpoints, the load balancing for Clickhouse replicas and also the ingestion part. It’s a Python application with small bits of C++ for critical request paths.</li> <li>A Clickhouse cluster</li> <li>A Zookeeper cluster for data replication within Clickhouse</li> </ul> <p>It’s pretty simple (because we like to keep things as simple as possible) and using components we know pretty well. To be clear, in this case the amount of QPS was not going to be crazy high (less than 200QPS) so Nginx and Varnish acted just as routing tools with not so much load (more on this later) but any other load balancer would work pretty well too.</p> <h2 id="the-initial-numbers">The initial numbers</h2> <p>The plan was to have between 50-100QPS (with 120 QPS peaks) with a response time under 150ms over datasets with some millions of rows (trying not to be too specific here on purpose). The queries were not simple: they needed several joins with tables which were changing quite often so we couldn’t precalculate too many things.</p> <p>Around 5 ingestions happened per second with millions of rows ingested per minute.</p> <p>Every hour, many millions of rows would be imported to resync last hours’ with changes that might had been missed in the original database.</p> <h2 id="the-approach">The approach</h2> <p>The best way to run any analytics service is to serve static data. That’s the perfect world because it is inexpensive and fast as hell.</p> <p>With dynamic data, what you want to do is to convert the data as it’s ingested into static data so that you only process the data once. That’s possible when the amount of combinations you have to generate is low. A static blog generator with a few posts a day is one example of this.</p> <blockquote> <p>But when the amount of combinations is high you have to process the data as it comes in as much as you can so it’s fast to query, but taking into account the processing time should be low because you don’t want to add lag (if not, it would not be real-time)</p> </blockquote> <p>Our product uses Clickhouse and that’s what we used for the data storage and queries. It’s almost perfect for this use case: it allows to run queries over large amounts of data pretty fast, the latency is low and scales horizontally and vertically.</p> <p>So the plan was easy: using materialized views from Clickhouse, generating views to cover the most frequent use cases. Take into account that Clickhouse matviews are incremental - you don’t need to recalculate the whole view when new data is added. If you use Clickhouse and you are not using them you should take a look, you may save several orders or magnitude in query time.</p> <h2 id="ingestion">Ingestion</h2> <p>But there is one big problem: as I said we need to run upserts because the data comes from a transactional database. And Clickhouse (like other databases in the same space) doesn’t deal with upserts in real time.</p> <p>So what we did was to <em>split the main table</em>, the one with all the sales, in two: one (we call it RT) for the latest 30 minutes and another one for the rest (HISTORIC). Each table has the same materialized views but obviously they are different.</p> <p>The RT one is really easy to work with because the amount of rows in there is not going to be crazy, so we can recalculate it completely to run the upserts in real time. It takes less than 1 second with several million rows to run all the upserts and recalculate all the mat views for that “small” table.</p> <p>The HISTORIC one works as an incremental table and data older than 30 minutes is appended to the table. We don’t expect too many changes in rows after 30 minutes, that’s why we move data to this table.</p> <p>For rows that change after 30 minutes we run an hourly process to update parts of the HISTORIC table and recalculate all the materialized views for that table, only for data that has changed.</p> <p>The important part: we run this in several machines but taking into account we can never return inconsistent results, every operation needs to be aware of replication lag (pretty low I have to say) and run all the changes in an atomic way. This sounds easy but it isn’t; however, it is something that comes out of the box with Tinybird so we didn’t have to pay too much attention to it.</p> <p>For the table schema we tried to use the smallest possible data types to save as much space as possible since everything should be in memory to be fast. Also we used LZ4 compression (default for Clickhouse) since it provides a good ratio between compression and decoding speed, so it saves quite a lot of memory bandwidth.</p> <p>In order to optimize the ingestion process we also used one of the recently added features in Clickhouse, the in memory data parts, that lets you insert rows into a MergeTree table without actually syncing them to disk, which improves performance. All the tables were replicated (multi-master) so in case of a problem with the machine running the ingestion processes, we could switch to a different one without downtime. Data loss was really unlikely since the ingestion process would send the rows again in case of a failed insert.</p> <h2 id="querying">Querying</h2> <p>Once you have the materialized views, the queries are easy: just regular SQL following the real time rules:</p> <ul> <li>The best data is the one you don’t have to read. Using Clickhouse indexing to skip non needed data is key</li> <li>Lightweight operations first: filtering always goes first.</li> <li>Replacing joins with “WHERE column IN (SELECT …)” when possible, generally much faster. Using <a href="https://gist.github.com/javisantana/07c689564874cea6e4a31bd40fc770b1">transform function</a> when possible.</li> <li>Monitoring and optimizing query times, but also minimising the amount of bytes scanned. We always aim to scan as few bytes as possible in the first steps of the query and then try optimize to reduce the times. We split queries in several chunks so we know how many resources each part of the query takes, see <a href="https://ui.tinybird.co/snapshot/7437e5efa1f944a0b7cc017751696ea3">an example</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Also to be able to run queries over two tables without overlapping data, we used a simple but powerful technique: using a table to store the split date.</p> <div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>select</span> <span>split_date</span> <span>from</span> <span>split_table</span>
<span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>split_date</span>
<span>select</span> <span>…</span> <span>from</span> <span>historic</span> <span>where</span> <span>date</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>split_date</span>
<span>union</span> <span>all</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>select</span> <span>split_date</span> <span>from</span> <span>split_table</span>

<span>select</span> <span>…</span> <span>from</span> <span>RT</span> <span>where</span> <span>date</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>split_date</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div> <p>We have to run the Common Table Expression twice because its scope only covers one select, something that is being improved in Clickhouse as I write this.</p> <p>The objective was to run all the queries under 150ms with just one core. This is important because there was a lot of concurrency and also we have to leave some spare cores to work on the ingestion process. In our standard setup the load balancer routes more read requests to the machines not ingesting data at that moment so query time percentiles stay low.</p> <p>For the read load balancer we used a round-robin policy (all the requests take more or less the same time) but ideally the load balancer should try to route requests that use the same part of the data to the same machines to use caching as much as possible. In this case it wasn’t critical because the tables we were querying were not huge and we were running in large machines (32 cores, 64gb ram), so read tables fit in memory.</p> <p>We also used Varnish to avoid duplicate requests. When running dashboards, it’s pretty common for many browsers to request the same url at the same time, so using <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/users-guide/vcl-grace.html#grace-mode">Varnish grace mode</a> we avoided extra work in the database.</p> <p>Varnish was also ready for plan B: in case of an unexpected load peak well outside of our predictions, we could enable caching with a small TTL to save some requests to the database.</p> <blockquote> <p>One final comment: we optimized queries and materialized views taking into account the distribution of calls to different endpoints. It’s much better to speed up an endpoint which is run 80% of the times than another one which is 2x slower.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this sounds like obvious but developers sometimes forget about two things: basic maths and the big picture. If you are interested we published a blog post on <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/">how we optimize our endpoints based on basic statistics</a></p> <h2 id="final-numbers-and-results">Final numbers and results</h2> <p>Numbers after Black Friday days (4 in our case):</p> <ul> <li>We ingested +650B rows.</li> <li>All the queries read a total of …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

						<p>The holiday season is still not done delivering bad news. With ICUs at 0% capacity in some parts of the United States, Public health officials wonder if the seasonal change alone will affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A recent research study has studied the influence of temperature and humidity on the properties of individual virus-likes.</p><blockquote>When it comes to fighting the spread of this virus, you kind of have to fight every particle individually. And so you need to understand what makes each individual particle degrade. People are also working on vaccines and are trying to understand how the virus is recognized? All of these questions are single particle questions. And if you understand that, then that enables you to fight a hoard of them.</blockquote><p>The results indicate cold weather could have a preserving effect on the virus. The first study to evaluate the mechanics of the virus at a single particle stage, found that other coronaviruses tend to infect more people during the winter months.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Picture1.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Picture1.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Picture1.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Picture1.png 1302w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-us-maps-and-cases/">CNN; Johns Hopkins University</a></figcaption></figure><p>"You would expect that temperature makes a huge difference, and that's what we saw.

			<p>There is a growing body of evidence showing that many of our current chronic diseases (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity) all revolve around the balance of utilizing fatty acids for energy, normalizing blood glucose levels, and maintaining a healthy muscle mass and weight. The SCD1 gene impacts all of these topics.</p>
<p>This article explains the function of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and then dives into the genetic variants that impact your base levels. We will end with the research on how diet impacts SCD1 and how you may be able to manipulate it for weight loss.</p>

<h2><span id="StearoylCoA_Desaturase_1_%E2%80%93_converting_fatty_acids_in_your_cells"></span>Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 – converting fatty acids in your cells<span></span></h2>
<p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1 gene) is the rate-limiting enzyme needed for the body’s creation of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>First, some background information for context (skip ahead if you know this), and then I’ll get into the SCD1 gene and how it affects overall health, weight, and metabolic health.</p>
<h3><span id="Background_how_your_body_uses_food_as_fuel"></span>Background: how your body uses food as fuel<span></span></h3>
<p>Your cells create energy from <strong>two fuel sources: carbohydrates</strong>, which break down into glucose, <strong>and fat</strong>, which can be utilized in fatty acid oxidation for energy. When glucose is available, it is used preferentially for creating energy, and when glucose levels fall, fatty acids get used for energy.</p>
<p>We survive as a species because we are flexible in our ability to survive eating different diets — from hunter-gatherers eating mammoths and tubers to agrarian cultures eating mainly grains to my Irish ancestors who likely made it through famine times eating potatoes.</p>

<p>The body can convert glucose into fat for storage(called <em>de novo lipogenesis</em>), and it can convert fat back into glucose if needed (<em>gluconeogenesis</em>). While most cells can run on fatty acids for fuel, the brain needs glucose and thus the conversion of fat to glucose if needed.</p>
<p>When you eat foods containing fat, the fat gets broken down in a couple of ways with different lipase enzymes. These lipase enzymes (gastric, pancreatic) break up the fat into fatty acids and glycerol, and then bile acids act as emulsifiers, allowing the fatty acid to cross the mucous layer for absorption. (more thorough <a href="https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Nutrition/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_Nutrition_(Zimmerman)/05%3A_Lipids/5.04%3A_Digestion_and_Absorption_of_Lipids#:~:text=In%20the%20stomach%20fat%20is,fats%20through%20the%20lymph%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explanation here</a>)</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Fatty_acids_in_the_body"></span>Background: Fatty acids in the body<span></span></h4>
<p>While we often just think of ‘fat’ as the extra padding around our waist and hips, fatty acids have <strong>three different roles</strong> in the body:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fatty acids, mainly unsaturated fatty acids, make up the<strong> cell membranes</strong> of all the cells in the body.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can break down for the mitochondria use them to create <strong>energy</strong> in the form of ATP. Fatty acids are also the main way of storing fuel for later use.</li>
<li>Fatty acids can act as <strong>signaling molecules</strong>, causing many different downstream effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>So keep in mind that as we dig into this topic of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the body is regulating and using these fats in multiple ways.</p>
<h4><span id="Background_Types_of_fatty_acids"></span>Background: Types of fatty acids<span></span></h4>
<p>Fatty acids consist of carbon and hydrogen and referred to as saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats have all of their carbons bound to hydrogens, and unsaturated fats have at least one carbon bound to another carbon instead of a hydrogen. This change in the structure of the fatty acid differentiates saturated from unsaturated fats.</p>
<p>Saturated fats are generally solids at room temperature, and unsaturated fats are liquids.</p>
<p>Fatty acids are named based on the number of carbons in the chain and how many unsaturated double bonds between carbons exist. Saturated fats have no unsaturated double bonds. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have one unsaturated double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two unsaturated double bonds.</p>

<h3><span id="SCD1_converting_saturated_fat_to_monounsaturated_fat"></span>SCD1: converting saturated fat to monounsaturated fat<span></span></h3>
<p>Getting back on topic here, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme is found in all cell types and in all animals and plants. The SCD1 gene codes for the stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme which converts saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>The cell membrane surrounding all of your cells consists of fatty acids. Some of those fatty acids can be saturated, but most of them need to be unsaturated, in order to give more fluidity to the cell membrane. Saturated fats, which are solids at room temperature, are less fluid in cell walls.</p>
<p>The stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme changes the bond in the saturated fat to make it unsaturated and more flexible.</p>
<p>Specifically, the SCD enzyme converts stearic acid (saturated fat with 18 carbons) into oleic acid (unsaturated fat, 18 carbons, and one unsaturated double bond).&nbsp; It can also convert palmitic acid into palmitoleic acid.</p>

<p>Saturated and unsaturated fats are also found in foods that you eat. Stearic acid is found in beef fat (tallow), chocolate (cacao butter), and dairy fat. Palmitic acid is found in palm oil.</p>
<p>I’ll come back to the dietary aspects of SCD1 in the Lifehacks section…</p>
<p><strong>Does SCD1 alter your ability to burn off stored fat?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To lose weight, you have to use your stored fat for energy at a rate that is higher than your rate of replacing that fat.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that <strong>SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) is increased in people with obesity and metabolic syndrome.</strong> Additionally, people who are obese have higher ratios of monounsaturated fat to saturated fat (MUFA:SFA ratio).[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30754064/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The question, though, is whether the increased SCD1 caused obesity or whether it was elevated in response to having metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>Animal research may give us the answer. Research consistently shows that lower SCD1 levels keep the animal lean, even on a diet that normally would make them fat. The researchers decrease the SCD1 levels through manipulating the gene in various tissues of the animal, seeing the results of knocking out the gene in different organs.</p>
<p><em>Why does a lower SCD1 level keep mice lean?</em> The lack of SCD1 enzyme causes an increase in the rate of using up fat for fuel in the mitochondria. This increased fatty acid β-oxidation is through activation of the AMPK pathway.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>decreased SCD1 = increased burning of fat</p>
<p>Additionally, mice with <strong>SCD1 deficiency had better insulin sensitivity and reduced liver fat</strong>. They were ‘hypermetabolic’, burning off fat at a faster rate, irrespective of a fattening diet. The researchers were able to pinpoint that the <strong>deletion of SCD1 in skin and muscle tissue</strong> is what keeps the mice lean through increasing overall metabolism.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>][<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31241768/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>While <strong>decreased SCD1</strong> gives the benefit of decreasing weight gain, it also <strong>increases oxidative stress in the mitochondria and stress in the endoplasmic reticulum</strong>. Specifically, it seems that the decrease in oleic acid drives the ER stress, while low palmitoleic acid does not seem to matter.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701860/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>

<p><em>Let’s dig into some more details here…</em></p>
<h4><span id="Liberating_fat_from_your_adipose_tissue"></span>Liberating fat from your adipose tissue:<span></span></h4>
<p>Lipolysis is the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue for use in the body as energy or in other ways.</p>
<p>Most cells in the body get replaced at the end of their lifecycle. This happens quickly for some cell types, like intestinal cells that turn over in a matter of days, and more slowly for other types, like heart cells which turnover very slowly, if at all.</p>
<p>Adipose cells are around for about 9 years, on average. Interestingly, the fat stored in adipose tissue has an average age of 1.4 years. This means that once the fat is stored, it doesn’t get used up and replaced very fast. As people who are obese get older, the usage of fat from fat cells for fuel tends to slow down and accumulation speeds up a bit.[<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21947005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>The SCD1 enzyme is key in the fatty acid composition in your adipose tissue. Animal studies show that knocking out the SCD1 gene alters the fatty acid make up of adipocytes.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5625094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<h4><span id="Brown_fat,_beige_fat,_and_white_fat"></span>Brown fat, beige fat, and white fat:<span></span></h4>
<p>Brown fat, found in small amounts in adults, is an active type of fat cell that burns through a lot of fuel and produces a lot of heat. Lean people usually have more brown adipose tissue, and people who are obese usually have little to no brown fat. Brown fat is brown due to the high number of mitochondria in each cell, and it helps to both produce heat and burn off excess energy.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>White fat (white adipose tissue) is what you typically think of for fat cells. It is a storage cell, keeping fat on board for a time of famine. Not as many mitochondria, not producing the heat or energy that the brown fat does.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers discovered that white adipose tissue can be induced to become more like brown adipose tissue. This in-between fat cell type is termed beige or brite adipose tissue. Exposure to cold is one way that white adipose tissue can be induced to become the heat-producing, metabolically active beige fat.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034754/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>A 2020 research paper published in <em>PNAS</em> shows that when adipose cells are formed from stem cells, they can take two paths: white or beige. SCD1 is key to which path the stems cells take. The animal study showed that decreased SCD1 caused the stem cells to differentiate into beige adipose tissue, rather than white. The decreased SCD1 only affected the formation of new adipose cells – it didn’t convert existing white adipose tissue to beige.[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>]</p>
<p>Succinate is an intermediary formed when the mitochondria produce ATP in the electron transport chain. The researchers also found that the rising succinate levels due to the lack of SCD1 were the trigger for beige adipose differentiation. In cell culture, succinate alone is capable of causing adipose stem cells to differentiate as beige cells instead of white. The increase in succinate accompanies an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to search, browse, and retrieve wiki data from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>For this, we will be using a python library called <span>Wikipedia-API</span> which is quite impressive. Wikipedia-API is an easy to use Python wrapper for <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia’s</a> API. It supports extracting texts, sections, links, categories, translations, etc from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>It even allows you to retrieve the wiki information as HTML so that you could use it in web apps or websites.</p>



<p>We will begin by installing the library:</p>

<pre><code>pip install wikipedia-api</code></pre>



<h2>Searching Wikipedia</h2>

<p>Let's search for the term "Computer Programming"</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")</code></pre>

<p>The <span>first line of code imports the<tt> wikipediaapi</tt></span> and the<span> second line creates a Wikipedia object</span>. The last line searches for the page on<em> "Computer Programming"</em> and returns a <span>WikipediaPage object </span>which is then stored in the <code>page</code> variable.</p>

<p>To check if the page exists:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.exists())          # True</code></pre>

<p><br>
To retrieve a page summary:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.summary)</code></pre>

<p><br>
For the full URL of the page:</p>

<pre><code>print(page.fullurl)           # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming</code></pre>



<h2>Extracting all information from the Wikipedia page.</h2>

<p>Ok, now let's do more like extracting the whole page in a text format. Putting it all together,</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- title ----------")
print(page.title)

print("----------- Page URL ---------")
print(page.fullurl)

print("---------- summary ----------")
print(page.summary[:100])             # slicing summary
print()

print("---------- Main text information -----------")
print(page.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<strong><span>output:</span></strong></p>

<pre><code>---------- title ----------
Computer Programming
----------- Page URL ---------
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
---------- summary ----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to acco

---------- Main text information -----------
Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable 
computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms
 accuracy and resource consumption...(it's more)</code></pre>



<p>Note that the <strong>main text information </strong>is a lot of information and I've truncated it here for simplicity.</p>



<h2>Extracting page in HTML</h2>

<p>To extract a wiki page in HTML, we must tweak our wiki object a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia(language="en",
                                   extract_format=wikipediaapi.ExtractFormat.HTML)

page_html = wiki_html.page("Computer Programming")

print("---------- HTML ----------")
print(page_html.text)</code></pre>

<p><br>
<span><strong>output (truncated):</strong></span></p>

<pre><code>---------- HTML ----------
&lt;p class="mw-empty-elt"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Computer programming&lt;/b&gt; is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. 
Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen 
programming language (commonly referred to as &lt;b&gt;coding&lt;/b&gt;). The source code of a program is
 written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. 
The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) 
on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 
Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the...(truncated)</code></pre>



<h2>How to get all Wikipedia pages under a category</h2>

<p>Wikipedia puts its pages under categories like Physics, Science, Programming, Medicine, Company, Celebrity, Countries, Books, etc.</p>

<p>To retrieve all pages in a particular category:</p>

<pre><code>import wikipediaapi

wiki_html = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')

page = wiki_html.page("Category:Physics")

for c in page.categorymembers.values():
    print(c)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output</strong></p>

<pre><code>Physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Outline of physics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Portal:Physics (id: ??, ns: 100)
Apriorics (id: ??, ns: 0)
Computational anatomy (id: ??, ns: 0)
Conformon (id: ??, ns: 0)
Diffeomorphometry (id: ??, ns: 0)
Dispersive medium (id: ??, ns: 0)
Galilean non-invariance of classical electromagnetism (id: ??, ns: 0)
Homeokinetics (id: ??, ns: 0)
...
...
...</code></pre>



<p>Well, that is it for this tutorial, this is useful when you want to use some data from Wikipedia inside your web applications or any programs you may write.</p>

It contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) which has instructions for making the spike protein. This is a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which the virus needs to enter the body’s cells.</p><p>When a person is given the vaccine, some of their cells will read the mRNA instructions and temporarily produce the spike protein. The person’s immune system will then recognise this protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells (white blood cells) to attack it.</p><p>If, later on, the person comes into contact with SARS-CoV-2 virus, their immune system will recognise it and be ready to&nbsp;defend the body against it.</p><p>The mRNA from the vaccine does not stay in the body but is broken down shortly after vaccination.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/conditional-marketing-authorisation" id="glossary-term-43109" target="_blank" title="The approval of a medicine that addresses unmet medical needs of patients on the basis of less comprehensive data than normally required.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2020 has brought permanent change to the working world and the way that economic incentives are pointed. Let’s walk through how the effects we’re starting to see today will reward those who can position themselves well. A vaccine is starting to be deployed as of the time of writing and we can imagine how a post COVID world will play out. Having worked with data for some time, I can confidently say that forecasting is generally wrong for most things - <em>but forecasts that anticipate how incentives will affect behaviour are usually right</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-concept-of-distinct-countries-is-starting-to-crack"><a href="#the-concept-of-distinct-countries-is-starting-to-crack" aria-label="the concept of distinct countries is starting to crack permalink"></a>The concept of distinct countries is starting to crack.</h3>
<p>Everyday people have never had so much individual freedom and autonomy. The immense but quiet transition happening is the world moving away from geography-based local economies to a single global cyber-based economy. Profound implications result from this tectonic shift. </p>
<p>An increase in human mobility across borders will mean that skilled individuals will move to wherever suits them best at that point in time. Personal quality of life considerations will weigh heavily into this, favouring lower cost of living locales with good weather, culture, and social opportunities. Countries with high taxation will see brain drain and capital flight in increasing amounts. When money can be earned anywhere, you won’t be obligated to subjugate yourself to high taxes. Rather than being tied to the work opportunities in your local city, you can live in one country and be employed in another, using financial arbitrage to your advantage. Of course, this only works for those who can work online - any career relating to physical goods or services will remain local. The flipside of this is that you now compete globally for work! Companies that don’t offer remote work will lose the talent war and won’t be able to draw the “A Players” they seek. The age of the sovereign individual is here. In an extreme example, it is possible to declare tax non-residency from your home country, instead choosing to be taxed in a nation state with minimal or no tax requirements - potentially avoiding paying taxes altogether. Governments that charge too much will drive away their best customers. The digital nomad movement is a prime example of this. The nation-state will not endure these changes in its present form. </p>
<p><strong>For greater future flexibility and options, you should do everything that you can to make your career remote. It will give you much more career capital and let you work with the most successful people.</strong></p>
<h3 id="introducing-you-incorporated"><a href="#introducing-you-incorporated" aria-label="introducing you incorporated permalink"></a>Introducing "You, Incorporated"...</h3>
<p>One change that has been accelerated is the trend of rapidly changing jobs rather than having a long career in one company. The incentives are increasingly against those who stay in their jobs for more than a few years. Performance evaluations, corporate politics, wage structures all advantage those who jump between opportunities more often. The corporate ladder is now more diagonal for those with the highest aspirations. Nothing here is a revolutionary prediction but here is what is: <strong>eventually the idea of having a job will go away altogether</strong>. The late game of this trend is that employees will become companies of one - independent contractors for contracted services. Your financial success will be completely dependent on your ability to provide goods or services that actually provide value. “What are you working on right now?” will be a more relevant question than “what do you do?”. The days of irrelevant paper-pushing jobs are numbered - eventually automation and technology will trim most of the fat from all but the biggest companies. </p>
<p><strong>To get an advantage, start looking at yourself as a company of one today. Start thinking about exactly why a business would pay you, not in terms of the skills you possess but because of the revenue you bring in or the costs you cut.</strong></p>
<h3 id="get-skilled--get-focused"><a href="#get-skilled--get-focused" aria-label="get skilled  get focused permalink"></a>Get Skilled &amp; Get Focused</h3>
<p>A lot of these changes are going to be acutely painful for unskilled workers. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the middle class is disappearing quickly. At some point, this could reach a boil and prompt strong negative reactions from those who are underemployed due to automation. There could be a widespread push back against those leveraging technology. We are already seeing the beginnings of this today but the momentum is continuing in this direction. Main Street businesses have been decimated by COVID and have concentrated power even more in the tech giants’ hands. It’s hard to predict how this ends when so much of the global power is concentrated in the hands of so few. The economy runs fine when there is a relatively wealthy middle class who keep it moving but we are entering the age of exclusively haves and have-nots. We could see large political movements rise up to tackle the issue with regulation. We could also see a larger subset of people opting out of the default working arrangements. </p>
<p><strong>If you want to avoid being on the wrong side of this widening chasm, it is time to double down on a skill that is in demand today. Ignore most other things. Programming, effective business writing, digital distribution, and video making are all very in demand skill sets as a starting point.</strong></p>
<h3 id="businesses-are-harder-to-track-online"><a href="#businesses-are-harder-to-track-online" aria-label="businesses are harder to track online permalink"></a>Businesses Are Harder To Track Online</h3>
<p>Information is power. Those who have it will win, those who don’t will lose. In parallel, technology is getting faster and more capable. If your business is not online, it does not exist. This is going to make it harder for governments to track business activity, again undermining their strength. Cryptocurrencies feed directly into this. As more money moves online, governments won’t be able to track or control it anymore. They’ll lose their power over commerce and won’t be able to treat their citizens as revenue sources. They also have the ability to erode savings held in fiat currencies through inflation and money printing. Part of the appeal of digital currencies is the hedge against inflation, though there are still many barriers to their widespread use for transactions. Digital businesses having a country of origin will largely lose meaning.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-i-do-today-to-help-my-future-self"><a href="#so-what-can-i-do-today-to-help-my-future-self" aria-label="so what can i do today to help my future self permalink"></a>So What Can I Do Today To Help My Future Self?</h2>
<p><strong>In the future, wealth will be measured by your ability to structure your affairs to complete individual autonomy and independence.</strong> </p>
<p>For some, there will be unprecedented financial independence in the new economy based on information. There is no doubt that the cyber economy is the greatest economic phenomenon in history so far. It enables infinite leverage. As access to technology grows and becomes more accessible, we can multiply our abilities as individuals by getting computers to complete tasks for us. </p>
<p><strong>For you to place yourself in a good spot, you need to focus on finding a point of leverage somewhere. Leverage means reaching more customers with less work. Tools that give you leverage include code (servers work for you), money (can be invested to earn compound returns), and media (create once, distribute forever). Would-be millionaires need to identify and capitalize on their specific points of leverage.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can teach yourself to solve problems, you have a bright career ahead. No matter where you live, you will find problems galore in need of solving. Those who would benefit from solutions to their problems, will pay you handsomely to solve them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>This web page is also available in <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/index.html.ja" lang="ja">日本語</a>.

</p>

<p id="summary">Yash, yet another shell,
is a POSIX-compliant command line shell written in C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).
Yash is intended to be the most POSIX-compliant shell in the world
while supporting features for daily interactive and scripting use.
Notable features are:
</p><ul>
<li>Global aliases
</li><li>Arrays
</li><li>Socket redirection, pipeline redirection, and process redirection
</li><li>Brace expansion and extended globbing
</li><li>Fractional numbers in arithmetic expansion
</li><li>Prompt command and command-not-found handler
</li><li>Command line completion with predefined completion scripts for more than 100 commands
</li><li>Command line prediction based on command history
</li></ul>
<p>Yash can be modified/redistributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(Version 2) but the use of this program is
<strong>without any warranty</strong>.
</p><p><a href="https://osdn.net/"></a>:
Yash is an OSDN-hosted project. See also the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/">project summary page</a>.

</p><h2 id="progress">Current Development Status</h2>
<p>Yash now fully supports POSIX.1-2008 (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2016 Edition)
except for the limitations listed in <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/README">README</a>.
</p><p>Yash is stable. A maintenance update is released every three months or so.
For the change history, see <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/NEWS">NEWS</a>.
</p><p>The source code is versioned in the <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/scm/svn/">Subversion repository</a> and mirrored
on <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash">GitHub</a>.

</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Yash is supposed to build and run on any POSIX.1-2001 environment
with the Software Development Utilities and the C-Language Development Utilities
options.
Currently, yash is mainly tested on Fedora, macOS, and Cygwin.

</p><h2 id="downloads">Installation</h2>
<p>The source tarball can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://osdn.net/projects/yash/releases/">release page</a>
(or the <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/releases">release list</a>).
</p><p>On <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo dnf install yash</kbd>. On <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, the yash package can be installed by <kbd>sudo apt-get install yash</kbd>. For macOS, <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> and <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> provide yash installation.
</p><p>After installation, enter <kbd>yash</kbd> in the terminal to start yash.
The <a href="https://yash.osdn.jp/doc/">manual</a> can be viewed by <kbd>man yash</kbd>.

</p><h2 id="configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>

<h3>Initialization scripts</h3>
<p>When yash is started as a login shell, it reads ~/.yash_profile.
This file is a shell script in which you define environment variables using the export command.
</p><p>When yash is started for an interactive use, it reads ~/.yashrc (after reading ~/.yash_profile if it is a login shell also).
In this file, you make other configurations such as aliases, prompt strings, key bindings for command line editing, and command-not-found handler.
Use the <a href="https://github.com/magicant/yash/blob/trunk/share/initialization/sample">sample yashrc</a> as a template for your ~/.yashrc.

</p><h3>Making yash your login shell</h3>
<p>In many Unix-like OSes, a shell must be listed in /etc/shells to be set as a login shell. Edit this file and ensure that the path to yash is written in the file.
</p><p>Then, run the <kbd>chsh</kbd> command in the terminal and follow instructions from the command.
Depending on your system, you may have to use another command to change the login shell.
See documentation on your system.

</code></pre><p>Let’s say the parser is being used as part of a language server, and the user has typed out a variable definition:</p><pre><code>let b = a
</code></pre><p>They realise they haven’t defined <code>a</code>, so they define it above:</p><pre><code>let a = 10
let b = a
</code></pre><p>While the user is in the middle of typing that, our parser sees this:</p><pre><code>let a =
let b = a
</code></pre><p>What we want is for our parser to recognise two variable definitions, with the first missing an expression. This way, language intelligence like Go To Definition can continue working in spite of an incomplete file; if we tell the editor to ‘go to the definition of <code>a</code>’, it will know where to go because it’s recognised two separate variable definitions. The parser would also report an error on the second <code>let</code> keyword along the lines of</p><pre><code>expected number, identifier, ‘-’ or ‘(’, but found ‘let’
</code></pre><p>Our goal for the rest of this part is to make Eldiro have this behaviour.</p><p>This is the simplest of all the error recovery techniques; if you expect to see a <code>Foo</code>, but see something else, you skip tokens until you find a <code>Foo</code>. This is simple to implement but doesn’t deliver the best output, since it throws away a lot of possibly-useful tokens. For example, all the underlined tokens here are thrown away:</p><pre><code data-lang="-">let a =
let b = a
-------
</code></pre><p>Here the IDE’s Go To Definition on <code>a</code> wouldn’t work, and the user would get an ‘undefined variable <code>a</code>’ error. Evidently, this error recovery strategy doesn’t let us achieve the ideal case we laid out before.</p><p>The idea is to start with the above approach, but <em>don’t skip certain tokens.</em> For example, let’s say we have the following code:</p><pre><code>{
  let a = {
    let bar =
  }
  10
}
</code></pre><p>The naive approach would start looking for an expression after the <code>let bar =</code>, and would stop throwing away tokens at <code>10</code>. It now consumes the final <code>}</code> to close the <code>let a = {</code> block. This doesn’t leave a <code>}</code> to close the surrounding block, though, which means the user gets an ‘unclosed <code>{</code>’ error. Here’s roughly what the parser sees if you don’t include errors and fix the indentation:</p><pre><code>{
  let a = {
    let bar = 10
  }
</code></pre><p>With the fancier approach, we can tell the parser not to skip <code>}</code> tokens, since those are important for recognising program structure. In languages with explicit statement terminators, parsers are often constructed so that <code>;</code> is never skipped. These tokens that aren’t to be skipped by the parser during error recovery are called ‘recovery sets’.</p><p>We can improve on this approach by only ever skipping one token, which means we throw away even less of the input.</p><p>Remember that ideal example from earlier?</p><pre><code>let a =
let b = a
</code></pre><p>We can achieve the goal of recognising two variable declarations by including <code>let</code> in the parser’s recovery set. This way, whenever the parser encounters an unexpected <code>let</code>, it will stop parsing what it’s up to and keep returning from subparsers until it gets to a state in which <code>let</code> can be recognised.</p><p>Let’s write a test for the case we just discussed:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// stmt.rs

    <h3 id="api-powered-file-conversion-to-mysql-postgresql-and-ms-sql-server-all-for-0">API-powered file conversion to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Server, all for $0.</h3>

<p>We’re excited to announce that from today, customers on the <strong>SQLizer free plan</strong> will have access to the <a href="https://sqlizer.io/help/api/">SQLizer API</a>.</p>

<p>Previously only available on our paid plans, the SQLizer API allows programmatic access to our file conversion engine, with its intelligent format detection algorithms.</p>

<p>SQLizer converts ‘flat’ data files (like CSV, Excel, or JSON) into database insert statements in SQL, ready to run, importing data into your preferred database.</p>

<h3 id="intelligent-format-detection">Intelligent format detection</h3>

<p>Database columns need to know which type of data they hold - but many data files don’t state which type of data they contain. This makes importing data difficult because you need to work out which columns are in which formats. 
SQLizer works this out intelligently, and automatically.</p>

<h2 id="to-get-started-with-the-sqlizer-api">To get started with the SQLizer API</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://sqlizer.io/signup/">SQLizer Signup</a> and create a new account, you can select the <strong>free plan to process fewer than 5,000 rows of data</strong></li>
  <li>Visit <a href="https://sqlizer.io/account/">your SQLizer account</a> and copy your API key</li>
  <li>Visit the <a href="https://sqlizer.io/help/api/">SQLizer API documentation</a> for instructions on making your first request to the API</li>
</ol>

<p>We hope you enjoy working with the SQLizer API.</p>

<p><strong>.NET framework fans!</strong> If you work with .NET, then check out the <a href="https://github.com/sqlizer-io/sqlizer-client-dotnet">SQLizer .NET Client</a> on Github.</p>

<p>Over 4,000 designers responded to <a href="https://taylorpalmer.co/" target="_blank">Taylor Palmer</a>’s annual <a href="https://uxtools.co/" target="_blank">UX Tools</a> survey.</p>

<p>Here are some key takeaways from the results.</p>

<h2 id="1miro-had-massive-growth">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Miro had massive growth</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/miro.svg" alt="Miro had massive growth">
</figure>

<p>In the brainstorming category, <a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank">Miro</a> grew from 5% usage in 2019 to 33% in 2020. This has become one of my personal favorite tools.</p>

<h2 id="2people-love-whimsical">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;People love Whimsical</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/whimsical.svg" alt="People love whimsical">
</figure>

<p>Most tools averaged a rating of 3.5 out of 5, but <a href="https://whimsical.com/" target="_blank">Whimsical</a> achieved a great score of 4.5. Miro also had high scores, but Whimsical looks to be a great contender.</p>

<h2 id="3windows-adoption-is-climbing">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows adoption is climbing</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/windows-vs-mac.svg" alt="Windows adoption is climbing">
</figure>

<p>More designers are using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows" target="_blank">Windows</a>. 25% of respondents used Windows as one of their platforms for design this year, up from 18% last year.</p>

<h2 id="4figma-usage-skyrocketed">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Figma usage skyrocketed</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/figma.svg" alt="Figma usage skyrocketed">
</figure>

<p>Taylor said the <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> numbers were so high, Taylor had to double-check them. They were the clear winner in multiple categories, including the “Which tools are you most excited to try in 2021?” section.</p>

<h2 id="5testers-like-zoom--maze">5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Testers like Zoom &amp; Maze</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/user-testing.svg" alt="Testers favor Zoom &amp; Maze">
</figure>

<p><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> is the clear winner here, especially as it becomes a household name. <a href="https://maze.design/" target="_blank">Maze</a> also had a strong showing and high user rating. 25% don’t use software at all.</p>

<h2 id="6notion-is-a-budding-favorite">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Notion is a budding favorite</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/notion.svg" alt="Notion is a budding favorite">
</figure>

<p>There were several surprise appearances from <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a> in multiple categories. It’s clearly becoming a popular solution for many designers.</p>

<h2 id="7adobe-xd-is-slowly-emerging">7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Adobe XD is slowly emerging</h2>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/2020-tools-survey/adobe-xd.svg" alt="Adobe XD is slowly emerging">

<p id="introduction">The Transformer architecture<cite key="vaswani2017attention"></cite>
    has been powering a number of the recent advances in NLP. A breakdown of this architecture is provided <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">here</a> <cite key="alammar2018illustrated"></cite>. Pre-trained language models based on the architecture,
    in both its auto-regressive<cite key="liu2018generating,radford2018improving,radford2019language,brown2020language"></cite> (models that use their own output as input to next time-steps and that process tokens from left-to-right, like GPT2)
    and denoising<cite key="devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta,lan2019albert,lewis2019bart,raffel2019exploring"></cite> (models trained by corrupting/masking the input and that process tokens bidirectionally, like BERT)
    variants continue to push the envelope in various tasks in NLP and, more recently, in computer vision<cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></cite>. Our understanding of why these models work so well, however, still lags behind these developments.
</p>

<p>This exposition series continues the pursuit to interpret<cite key="rogers2020primer,atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    and visualize<cite key="vig2019visualizing,madsen2019visualizing,hoover2020,tenney2020language,wallace2019allennlp"></cite>
    the inner-workings of transformer-based language models.

We illustrate how some key interpretability methods apply to transformer-based language models. This article focuses on auto-regressive models, but these methods are applicable to other architectures and tasks as well.
     
</p>

<p>This is the first article in the series. In it, we present explorables and visualizations aiding the intuition of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Input Saliency</strong> methods that score input tokens importance to generating a token.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Neuron Activations</strong> and how individual and groups of model neurons spike in response to
        inputs and to produce outputs.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The next article addresses <strong>Hidden State Evolution</strong> across the layers of the model and what it may tell us about each layer's role.</p>

<!--more-->

<!--
    <li>
        <strong>Attention</strong>, a central concept in transformers, and how recent work<cite key="abnar2020quantifying"></cite>
        leads to visualizations that are more faithful to its role.
    </li>
-->

<p>In the language of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) literature like Molnar et al.<cite key="molnar2020interpretable"></cite>, input saliency is a method that explains individual predictions. The latter two methods fall under the
    umbrella of "analyzing components of more complex models", and are better described as increasing the transparency<cite key="du2019techniques,carvalho2019machine"> </cite> of transformer models.
</p>

<p>Moreover, this article is accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/tree/main/notebooks">reproducible notebooks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/">Ecco - an open source library</a> to create similar
    interactive interfaces directly in Jupyter notebooks<cite key="ragan2014jupyter"></cite>
    for GPT-based<cite key="radford2018improving"></cite> models from the HuggingFace transformers library<cite key="wolf2019huggingface"></cite>.
</p>

<p>If we're to impose the three components we're examining to explore the architecture of the transformer, it would look like the following figure.</p>

<h2 id="saliency">Input Saliency</h2>

<p>When a computer vision model classifies a picture as containing a husky, saliency maps can tell us whether the classification was made due to the visual properties of the animal itself, or because of the snow in the background<cite key="ribeiro2016whyribeiro2016why"></cite>. This is a method of <i>attribution</i> explaining the relationship between a model's output and inputs -- helping us detect errors and biases, and better understand the behavior of the system.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/dog-saliency-map.jpg">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Input saliency map attributing a model's prediction to input pixels.
        </strong> <br>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multiple methods exist for assigning importance scores to the inputs of an NLP model<cite key="li2015visualizing,arrieta2020explainable"></cite>. The literature is most often concerned with this application for classification tasks, rather than natural
    language generation. This article focuses on language generation. Our first interface calculates feature importance after each token is generated, and by
    hovering or tapping on an output token, imposes a saliency map on the tokens responsible for generating it.
</p>

<p>
    The first example for this interface asks GPT2-XL<cite key="radford2019language"></cite> for William Shakespeare's date of birth. The model is correctly able to produce the date (1564, but broken into two tokens: " 15" and "64", because the model's vocabulary does not include " 1564" as a single token). The interface shows the importance of each input token when generating each output token:
</p>
<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of Shakespeare's birth
            year using Gradient × Input.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        GPT2-XL is able to tell the birth date of William Shakespeare expressed in two tokens. In generating the
        first token, 53% of the importance is assigned to the name (20% to the first name, 33% to the last name).
        The next most important two tokens are " year" (22%) and " born" (14%). In generating the second token to
        complete the date, the name still is the most important with 60% importance, followed by the first portion
        of the date -- a model output, but an input to the second time step. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe world knowledge. It was generated using greedy decoding. Smaller variants of GPT2
        were not able to output the correct date.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our second example attempts to both probe a model's world knowledge, as well as to see if the model
    repeats the patterns in the text (simple patterns like the periods after numbers and like new lines, and
    slightly more involved patterns like completing a numbered list). The model used here is DistilGPT2<cite key="sanh2020distilbert"></cite>.
</p>

<p>This explorable shows a more detailed view that displays the attribution percentage for each token -- in case you need that precision.</p>

<figure>
   
    
    <br>
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a list of EU countries</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was generated by DistilGPT2 and attribution via Gradients X Inputs. Output sequence is cherry-picked to
        only include European countries and uses sampled (non-greedy) decoding. Some model runs would include China,
        Mexico, and other countries in the list. With the exception of the repeated " Finland", the model continues
        the list alphabetically.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another example that we use illustratively in the rest of this article is one where we ask the model to complete
    a simple pattern:</p>

<figure>
   
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a simple
            alternating pattern of commas and the number one.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        Every generated token ascribes the first token in the input the highest feature importance score. Then
        throughout the sequence, the preceding token, and the first three tokens in the sequence are often the most
        important. This uses Gradient × Inputs on GPT2-XL. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe the model's response to syntax and token patterns. Later in the article, we build
        on it by switching to counting instead of repeating the digit ' 1'. Completion gained using greedy decoding.
        DistilGPT2 is able to complete it correctly as well.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is also possible to use the interface to analyze the responses of a transformer-based conversational agent.
    In the following example, we pose an existential question to DiabloGPT<cite key="zhang2020dialogpt"></cite>:
</p>

<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of DiabloGPT's answer to the ultimate question</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was the model's first response to the prompt. The question mark is attributed the highest score in the
        beginning of the output sequence. Generating the tokens " will" and " ever" assigns noticeably more importance to
        the word " ultimate".
        This uses Gradient × Inputs on DiabloGPT-large.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Input_Saliency.ipynb"><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/colab-badge.svg"></a>
</p>

<h3>About Gradient-Based Saliency</h3>
<p>Demonstrated above is scoring feature importance based on Gradients X Inputs<cite key="denil2015extraction,shrikumar2017just"></cite>-- a gradient-based saliency method shown by Atanasova et al.<cite key="atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    to perform well across various datasets for text classification in transformer models.
</p>

<p>To illustrate how that works, let's
    first recall how the model generates the output token in each time step. In the following figure, we see how
    <span>①</span>
    the
    language model's final hidden state is projected into the model's vocabulary resulting in a numeric score for
    each
    token in the model's vocabulary. Passing that scores vector through a softmax operation results in a probability
    score for each token. <span>②</span> We proceed to select a token
    (e.g. select the highest-probability scoring token, or sample from the top scoring tokens) based
    on
    that vector.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/111.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient-based input saliency
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span>③</span> By calculating the gradient of the
    selected logit (before the softmax) with respect to the inputs by back-propagating it all the way back to the
    input tokens, we get a signal of how important each token was in the calculation resulting in this generated
    token.
    That assumption is based on the idea that the smallest change in the input token with the highest
    feature-importance
    value makes a large change in what the resulting output of the model would be.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/gradXinput.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient X input calculation and aggregation
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The resulting gradient vector per token is then multiplied by the input embedding of the respective token. Taking
    the L2 norm of the resulting vector results in the token's feature importance score. We then normalize the
    scores by dividing by the sum of these scores.</p>

<p>More formally, <span>gradient</span> × <span>input</span> is described as follows:</p>

<p>
    <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msub><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \lVert \nabla _{X_i} f_c (X_{1:n})  X_i\lVert_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>
    Where <span id="input_term"></span> is the embedding vector of the input token at timestep <i>i</i>, and <span id="grad"></span> is the back-propagated gradient of the score of the selected token unpacked as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span id="input_embeddings"></span> is the list of …</li></ul></div></div>

December 21, 2020 | https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Last month, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world/">Cloudflare published a postmortem</a> of a recent 6-hour outage caused by a partial switch failure which left <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> unavailable as it was unable to establish a stable leader. This outage has understandably led to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1332711011451867139">discussion online</a> about exactly what liveness guarantees are provided by the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus algorithm in the face of network failures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">original Raft paper</a> makes the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Consensus algorithms] are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement implies that consensus algorithms such as Raft should tolerate network failures (also known as <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/">omission faults</a>) as long as they do not impact communication between the majority of servers.
In this post, we will consider whether Raft can guarantee liveness, and specifically whether it can establish a stable leader, if a network fault means that some servers are no longer connected to each other.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-guarantee-liveness-in-the-presence-of-network-failures">Does Raft guarantee liveness in the presence of network failures?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Raft, as described in the original paper, does not guarantee liveness in all such cases. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is only connected to server 2 and server 5 is only connected to server 3. Initially, server 3 is the leader. Server 4 is not connected to the leader so it will timeout, increment its term and send a RequestVote RPC to server 2. Server 2 will update its term and then force server 3 to do the same and thus step down. Eventually, a new leader will be elected (either server 1, 2, or 3) but either server 4 or server 5 (or both) will not be connected to the leader and thus will timeout, updating its term and forcing the leader to step down. This system will not be able to establish a stable leader.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%201.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>Partially connected servers 4 and 5 constantly interrupt the elected leader.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to guarantee liveness, Raft must ensure that if a leader is up and connected to a majority of responding servers then it will not be forced to step down. Fortunately, section 9.6 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Diego Ongaro’s thesis</a> suggests how this can be achieved using <strong>PreVote</strong>. PreVote requires potential candidates to run a trial election to test if they can win an election before incrementing their term and running a normal election using RequestVote. A server only pre-votes for a potential candidate during the PreVote phase if it would vote for it during a normal election, and importantly, if it has not received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader with in the election timeout. PreVote fixes the problem have we described as servers 4 and 5 will not update their terms as they will not receive pre-votes from the majority of servers.</p>

<p>An alternative fix is to require servers to ignore RequestVote RPCs if they have received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader within the election timeout. This was suggested in section 6 in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> as mitigation for liveness issues during reconfiguration. However, we will focus on PreVote instead.</p>

<h2 id="so-does-raft-with-prevote-guarantee-liveness-then">So, does Raft with PreVote guarantee liveness then?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately not. In fact, PreVote introduces new liveness issues to Raft. Consider the following example. We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is connected only to server 2 and server 5 has failed.</p>

<p>Initially, server 4 is the leader. It was elected before its links to the other servers (except server 2) failed. Server 4 is now unable to make progress as it is not connected to a majority of servers. Servers 1 and 3 will not hear from the leader so they will timeout and begin the PreVote phase. Neither server will complete its PreVote phase as server 2 will not pre-vote for either server as it still receives regular AppendEntries from the leader (server 4). This system will not able to elect a new leader and the old leader will not be able to make progress.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%202.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>The leader, Server 4, suffers partial network faults but does not step down. Server 2 does not timeout, severs 1 and 3 will fail PreVote because of server 2.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be addressed by requiring leaders to actively step down if they do not receive AppendEntries responses from a majority of servers. This optimisation is sometimes referred to as CheckQuourm and related matters are mentioned in section 6.2 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Ongaro’s thesis</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/3866">raft discussions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-with-prevote-and-checkquorum-guarantee-liveness">Does Raft with PreVote and CheckQuorum guarantee liveness?</h2>

<p>Yes. If there is no leader, then an election (or series of elections) will occur and eventually, a server will be elected leader. To be elected leader, the server must be connected to a majority of servers as it received votes from a majority of servers in the PreVote and RequestVote phases.</p>

<p>CheckQuorum ensures that if the elected leader is no longer connected to a majority of responding servers, it will step down and allow a new leader to be elected.</p>

<p>There will always be at least one server that can win an election. This is the server (or servers) with the most up-to-date log (logs) within the subset of servers which are all online and connected to a majority of responding servers. PreVote ensures that once a leader from this set has been elected, the system will be stable as it will not be forced to step down.</p>

<h2>The Future is Here! Have You Checked OpenAI’s GPT-3 Yet?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/future-is-here.png" title=""></p>

<p>Ever wonder how close has AI gotten to impersonating human beings?</p>
            <p>You’d be surprised!</p>

            <p>The latest GPT-3 can code computer programs, compose tweets, summarize emails, write news, answer questions, translate languages, and write fiction and poetry too. </p>
            <p>It can take up almost any virtual English language task. In the latest recent milestone on YouTube, it created an app that functions similar to Instagram.</p>
            <p>Dubbed as one of the most important <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/neuromorphic-computing-the-next-level-artificial-intelligence">advancements in AI</a> in recent years, GPT-3 or Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 has raised the AI goal posts many notches toward the stratosphere. It is the <b>largest artificial neural network</b> ever created.</p>
            <h4>The Impact of GPT-3 on the Artificial Intelligence Sphere</h4>

            <p>
                In September this year, Elon Musk had criticized exclusive licensing of the model to Microsoft. When tech heavyweights like Musk root for and track the developments and distribution of a technology, you know that it’s the next big thing out there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first version of GPT-3 was unveiled in February last year, and the private beta version was launched in June this year. The second version of the technology was so promising that it scared its makers about potential misuse. They waited a year to bring it in open and, as expected, the results were mind-boggling.
            </p>
            <p>
                GPT-3 wrote a blog piece elaborating on an experiment with bitcoin and called itself the biggest thing since bitcoin. It said: “GPT-3’s predicted sentences, when published on the bitcointalk.org forum, attracted lots of positive attention from posters there, including suggestions that the system must have been intelligent (and/or sarcastic) and that it had found subtle patterns in their posts.”
            </p>
            <p> The blog piece was trending on the Internet some months back.</p>
<p>  Arram Sabeti, a user, in his post-test blog said: “It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried… all you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future.”</p>
<p>
                Another user, Merzmensch Kosmopol, posted his conversation with GPT-3 on Twitter.
            </p>
          
            <p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/playground-chat.png"></p>
                <h4> Decoding the Method in the Magic: How GPT-3 works</h4>
<p> GPT-3 is a technology that generates text using pre-trained algorithms. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series and uses <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/advances-in-deep-learning-2020">deep learning</a> to give human-like text. It works on 175 billion parameters</p>
<p> The technology has been fed the complete data it needs to carry out its tasks. 570GB of text information from texts by OpenAI and data collected from CommonCrawl, a publicly available dataset, drive this titan.</p>
            <p> GPT-3 can generate text that appears to have been written by a human.</p>
<p>  How precise is it? In the words of pop psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, the impersonating AI definitely sounded like something he would say.</p>
<p>
                When asked the question “How do we become more creative?”, the AI, replicating the thoughts and speech patterns of its archetype, said:
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think creative expression is a natural byproduct of growing up in a diverse world. The more diverse the world is, the more you get exposed to different people, to different opportunities, to different places and to different challenges. And the more diverse that is, the more likely you’ll be to be able to put the dots together to form something new. And in many ways, I think if you want to be creative, you have to go for it. If you want to be a writer, you have to write, if you want to be a musician, you have to create music, if you want to be a comedian, you have to create comedy, and the more you create, the more likely it is that you’ll stumble onto some interesting stuff.”
            </p>
                <h4>Round-up</h4>
<p> The precision and usability of GPT-3 have already carved a formidable niche for it in researched journalism, news, politics, and advertisements. But this is just the beginning.</p>
            <p>  GPT-3 is a massive breakthrough in artificial intelligence. It can change the way we interact with technology.</p>
<p> Not surprisingly, the Internet is flooded with use cases. In a recent one, user Mario Klingemann posted this conversation of GPT-3 with an imaginary character on Twitter:</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/importance-of-twitter.png"></p>
<p>
                Ready to dive in GPT-3? You can request access from OpenAI to integrate the API into your product and develop an entirely new application. OpenAI is also welcoming user suggestions to help them explore the strengths and limits of their technology.

December 21, 2020 | https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="header2">
	<div>
<p>
<i>
In the <a href="https://skyalt.com/blog/repl.html">last article</a>, I wrote about the new IDE and programming language. It's just a prototype(not easy to read C code and many important features are missing), so the next logical move is to re-write it to the production-ready product.
</i></p><p><i>

Coincidentally, <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup school</a> is announcing YC Build Sprint, starting on August 24. My goal of the Sprint is to rewrite and launch SkyAlt. Can I build IDE in 4 weeks? Hell no, but maybe 8. Let's find out.
</i></p><p><i>

I will program in different fields. From rendering/UI, over network/cryptography, to parser/interpreter. Let the hacking begin!
</i></p></div>



	<h2>Week 1</h2>
	<div><p>
The first thing I wanna build is the ability to run SkyAlt on the server(run apps) and connect from a remote client(rendering, keyboard, mouse). For rendering, I chose SDL, mainly because it supports many operation systems. Network connections are TCP/IP handled by SDL_Net with simple custom protocol. Connections are encrypted. For that, I'm using functions from the OpenSSL library. The client needs a valid key to log-in.
</p><p>

The Protocol synchronize communication so the Client tells the server when it's ready for the next frame data. Also If the frame takes more time to finish, then Server tells the Client how much work on the frame was done and the Client shows the progress. The bottom-left conner shows FPS(frames per seconds) and bandwidth.
</p><p>

Rendering is bases on SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_ttf(fonts). It can draw rectangles, images, texts. The server sends only UTF-8 text, so fonts are on Client only. Every letter of the text is handled by my code(left, right, center align, ...). If apps include images(icons, ...), they are on the server, which sends (as files) them to the client's cache, where they are decompressed and converted into texture.
</p><p>

Also, I have one source code, but thanks to #define I can compile it like a Server(run apps) or a Client(remote, only rendering, mouse, keys) or a ClientServer(all inside).
</p><p>

By end of the week, I optimize the protocol cache for images and texts. Also, I clean up the code a little bit.
</p><p>

The video shows Client-Server where Server is sending commands(there are no apps, yet) what to draw to Client(window). Looks awful, but there is a lot of engineering behind it.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/3.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	<div><p>
The week starts with working on the dictionary. SkyAlt is dynamically-typed(static typing will be optional later, something like Javascript -&gt; Typescript) and the memory model is an associative array(dictionary data structure, every record has value and sub-records and so on). I chose this model because I care a lot about developer's experience and If you think about it, in statically typed language you have to start with designing data structures and if you run the program it does nothing because there are no algorithms and that's frustrating. I want SkyAlt users to start with algorithms right away and <b>thanks to REPL and preview they can see what they are making from the beginning</b>. Overall time to build an app is the same, but the experience is different.
</p><p>

The next day, I write and run a few extra tests for the dictionary and slowly pivot my focus into integrating the dictionary to the SkyAlt memory model(record - sub-records). I constantly think about performance vs memory footprint for the dictionary.
</p><p>

Then I write .json importer and exporter.
</p><p>


I start working on Parser for the SkyAlt language. I try to parse some simple source codes, fixing a few bugs and it seems to work. So for the next few days, I work on the Interpreter and improving parser as well. I run more and more advanced tests.
</p><p>

There was a problem with the order of parsing assets(files), when one app uses multiple assets and that assets use other assets and there can be cycles, but around an hour later I solve it.
</p><p>

The video shows allocating 10M records and creating 5 sub-records for everyone. Then it's computing summary of one sub-record: The first 'sum' is for pure implementation in C, the second 'sum' is for search sub-record through the dictionary. Then It's just deallocating memory.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/8.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 3</h2>
	<div><p>
I start the week with implementing catching pressed keys, mouse buttons &amp; position on Client and sending them on Server. The great thing about SDL is that everything is UTF-8(across different OSs).
</p><p>

Then I try to compile code on Linux. I fixed a lot of bugs and many warnings(GCC is more aggressive than MSVC). I also optimized a few places in code so there is less (de)alloc every frame. FPS goes up. This is probably the worst day working on this project so far. So many things were broken.
</p><p>

The next day I focus on the UI layout system. Early on working on project I set that <b>content is more important than design</b>(layout, shapes, colors). So when you work with SkyAlt language, It's super easy to create GUI and define layouts under them, but of course there are tradeoffs. There is only one layout(grid layout), but it can expand/stretch(different screen sizes). I end up the day with a system where you can set column/row size and optional maximum size. Also, It's super easy for developers to change column/row size.
</p><p>

Implementing scrolling(mouse wheel, arrows, home/end/pageUp/pageDown) was quick since most of the parts already exist, so I only connect them together.
</p><p>

I start working on a Single-line editbox - text selection, copy/paste.
</p><p>


I finish the week by fixing bugs, few performance issues and cleaning the code. I'm not really making aggressive optimizations, because <b>I need to see the big picture first</b>. I also avoid multi-threading.
</p><p>

Sorry, I didn't make a video.
	</p></div>



	<h2>Week 4</h2>
	<div><p>
Ok, 4th week, here we come.
</p><p>

I had to rewrite code that handling layouts. It's using less memory, hopefully, bug-free and cleaner code.
</p><p>

I fixed text-align, working with keys and implemented dialogs(center screen or like a context menu). Also, You can change GUI theme colors.
</p><p>

The Info panel on the client shows server FPS. This is not the real number of frames computed, because it computes only frames which the client needs(max. 60), but it's a number of frames which the server is possible to compute.
</p><p>

I start working on the Multi-line editbox - text selection, copy/paste. You can also scroll text! Uff;)
</p><p>

The video shows work in progress Settings app, where you will be able to change language, theme, etc. You can also change the row size. That was just for testing purposes, I've removed it after capturing video.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/26.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/26.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 5</h2>
	<div><p>
When you work hard for a few weeks, why not work harder?
</p><p>

When you change language, all assets are automatically re-parse. Also, You can put an image(file) into an asset folder and App can render it.
</p><p>

I've finished the Settings app from the previous week and make the Menu app(New/Open project, Settings, About, etc.). You can switch between Windowed / Fullscreen mode and save app(code, data, translations). Also I make the Translation app, where you can translate apps to different languages.
</p><p>

I rewrite how URL works: checking for cycles, safely removing records and better language syntax. I hope, I will not have to touch it again.
</p><p>

I implement Context help - when you move the mouse over the button, edit-box, etc. the description shows up with little delay.
</p><p>

I try making a more advanced version of multi-line edit-box to use it as a code editor. So I add line numbers, syntax highlighting, showing warnings/errors in code. I add auto-break lines that are longer than a view into Multi-line. Also work on selections: 2 clicks for selecting a word and 3 clicks for the line.
</p><p>

The next day I start implementing Folding. When you call a function in source-code, you can "expand" it and It will show you the body of the function.
</p><p>

I spend some time putting down CPU usage when the user is not active. When the user stops moving the mouse and pressing keys, it will go to 0%(no drawing) and every 5seconds it will go 0.2%(drawing one frame, so the user can see possible new/changed data) =&gt; minimum CPU clock speed. On another side, When the user is active, then it renders 60 frames per second and has a maximum CPU clock speed. That's how ImGui works. I will try to deal with that later.
</p><p>

I finally trace one stupid memory-leak which I knew of for over a week. I fixed save() when record(text) has quote character inside.
</p><p>

For the first time, my TODO list starts to become shorter.
</p><p>

The video shows basic code editor with (un)folding capability. There is a small bug which I fixed after making this video: when I unfold function, it unfolds all function with the same name.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/41.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/41.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 6</h2>
	<div><p>
Still motivated, I'm not slowing down!
</p><p>

I start with the cleaning code from the previous week. I compile it for Linux and discover some new warnings in code and few bugs.
</p><p>

I implement accounts. You can log-in with a username and 128bits key. Also, the Client window remembers position and size when it's closed and opened again.
</p><p>

I work on REPL. You can Alt+click into code and it will execute code up to that line and show you in preview. You can also Alt+click into app preview and it will unfold code to the line which draws the part of the app. It works well and it's quick. Although it doesn't work very well when an app has more than one layer(context menu, dialogs). I'll back into that later.
</p><p>

I also fix not-precise syntax/error highlights and change syntax highlight colors. Also, I fix the saving/reading json file. This is quite normal, I change code in one part and in some cases, I will have to change some other parts of the code as well. That's why I optimize code only when it hurts because optimize code is harder to rewrite.
</p><p>

The video shows simple IDE, where you can edit code(left) and see a preview of the app(right). You can also see folding and REPL in action.

	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/49.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/49.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 7</h2>
	<div><p>
On Monday, I noticed that If the code in SkyAlt language had errors, the Interpreter would still execute it. So I quickly fix that.
I also implement key shortcuts(copy, cut, paste, etc.) and text selection with arrows. Also, the parser will not run when you are …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Earn users trust by respecting and securing their data. Since 2018 the European Union (EU) has imposed a new obligation on entrepreneurs to protect customers personal data. A duty for one another is a right, a tool to defend one’s rights. Each user should have the right to decide on providing information about himself, resign from using his data, delete his account. It’s a strong right that should be obeyed by everyone. Why? Because of substantial penalties, up to 20 mln euro! Be well prepared with Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and GDPR requirements.</p>

<p><img src="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/gdpr-meaning/Flag_of_EU.png" alt="EU flag"></p>



<p>The General Data Protection Regulation is an EU law regulation on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also regulates how to proceed when personal data are transferred outside the EU and EEA areas.</p>

<p><strong>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable person</strong>, also known as the data subject. Example of personal data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name and last name,</li>
  <li>address,</li>
  <li>ID /Passport number,</li>
  <li>Income,</li>
  <li>cultural features,</li>
  <li>IP address.</li>
</ul>

<p>That law gives a strong right for people to manage their data. It protects us, physical people, before the abuse. It imposes an obligation on companies to ensure everyone the right to: get information about his data, obtain access to personal data, correct his data, erased data - to be forgotten, object to the processing of personal data for marketing purposes, request the restriction of the processing of personal data, data portability - receive personal data in a machine-readable format and send it to another controller, request that decisions based on automated processing concerning or significantly affecting the user and based on his data are made by natural persons, not only by computers and the right to be notified - if data has been a breach (a person should be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the violation). How to ensure that these rights are respected for SaaS users?</p>

<p><img src="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/gdpr-meaning/Facilities_for_User.png" alt="Facilities for users"></p>

<p>On the EU GDPR webpage (https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/), we can find this phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“(GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we fully agree. It is limited and requires small businesses to be fully committed to protecting user rights. On the other hand, there is a risk that profiling and making automated decisions on our behalf may limit our freedom.</p>

<p>The GDPR provides broad protection of the individual’s rights while imposing several new obligations on entrepreneurs. Until now, the entities, confirming their due diligence, have applied for ISO certificates in the field of data security. The current regulations impose the obligation to ensure the processed data’s safety - on all entities dealing with personal data. One of these obligations is appointing a Personal Data Protection Inspector (DPO) in certain cases and keeping detailed documentation describing data processing.</p>



<p>GDPR relates to companies based in the European Union, citizens and people lived in the EU, and those who want to offer services for them. If you’re outside of the EU, but your customers are from the EEA (The EEA covers more countries than the EU itself), it refers to you as well.</p>

<p>GDPR applies to every company, both sole proprietorships and companies - operating in the European Union, which processes personal data. It does not matter the nationality of the persons whose data is processed, where the processing takes place, or where the servers are located.</p>

<p>Examples of entities covered by the GDPR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an entrepreneur with a headquarters outside the EU, but performing activities on its territory,</li>
  <li>entities that offer their services to clients outside the Union but have their offices in the Union,</li>
  <li>companies processing data via cloud computing - it does not matter where the servers are located,</li>
  <li>an entrepreneur who does not have organizational units in the EU but offers EU citizens goods and services (e.g., an online store).</li>
</ul>

<p>The GDPR may apply to entities (controllers and processors) that do not have an organizational unit in the EU, also in the scope of the obligation to appoint a personal data protection officer, when the processing activities carried out by them are related to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offering goods or services to such data subjects in the EU, whether or not they are required to pay; or</li>
  <li>monitoring their behavior as far as this behavior occurs in the EU.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-protection-officer-do-you-need-it">Data Protection Officer, do you need it?</h2>

<p>When your company is established in the EU, you are obliged to appoint a DPO if:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You are a public authority or body and have appointed a DPO (except if you are a court acting in our judicial capacity).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your main activity is processing operations requiring regular and systematic monitoring of data subject on a large scale by their nature, scope, or purposes (e.g., you’re Google ;-)).</p>

    <p>Here it is crucial to explain “large-scale” meaning. The GDPR doesn’t define the concept of “large-scale” data processing. However, it is recommended to consider the following factors in order to determine whether large-scale processing takes place: the number of data subjects (a specific number or percentage of a particular group of the population), the scope of personal data processed, the period for which the data is processed, geographical scope of personal data processing. Thus, describing the process with this term is quite relative. The concept of “regular and systematic monitoring” of data subjects is also not defined in the GDPR. However, “monitoring of data subjects’ behavior” is mentioned in Recital 2415 and includes all online tracking and profiling forms, including for advertising purposes behavioral.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your main activity is the large-scale processing of special categories of personal data and personal data related to criminal convictions and offenses.</p>

    <p>Now, what does it mean “special categories of personal data”? Data of a special category can be included revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data allowing the identification of a natural person.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As mentioned above, if your company is not an EU resident and your clients are EU residents, you should (as the data controller) have a representative registered in the EU. According to its competence, the DPO appointment should be notified to the relevant Member State’s supervisory authority.</p>

<p><img src="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/gdpr-meaning/DPO_obligation.svg" alt="Do you need a DPO?"></p>

<p>The DPO should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be aware of national and European data protection laws;</li>
  <li>be familiar with the practices in the field of personal data protection;</li>
  <li>have business and industry knowledge regarding the administrator’s activities;</li>
  <li>know the data processing processes,</li>
  <li>know the information systems and security measures used by the controller and its data protection needs;</li>
  <li>demonstrate knowledge of the entity’s administrative procedures and operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The inspector is, therefore, to play a crucial role in supporting the “data protection culture” and help in the implementation of the necessary elements of the GDPR, i.e.:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rules for the processing of personal data;</li>
  <li>the rights of data subjects;</li>
  <li>data protection by design and data protection by default;</li>
  <li>keep a register of processing activities;</li>
  <li>processing security requirements;</li>
  <li>reporting violations.</li>
</ul>

<p>DPO suppose to be easily accessible as a point of contact for employees, individuals, and Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO). His contact details should be published on your website. If you are not obliged to appoint a DPO, you can designate a person who will track the newest trends, UE recommendations and keep a hand on your company’s personal data security.</p>

<p><strong>Note from the author:</strong></p>

<p>Even though it contains a lot of practical information about legal stuff, you cannot treat it as legal advice. Each case is different and requires an individual approach. The purpose of this article is to help you to understand the essence of its subject.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Commentary: Red Hat has been in hot water about changing the way CentOS operates, but that model looks like the exact right way for open source entrepreneurs to operate.</p><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
<figure><span></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Red Hat switched up CentOS to make it less of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone and more of a feeder project into RHEL (as Fedora was always supposed to be, yet wasn’t). Some people are mad, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-resets-centos-linux-and-users-are-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has written</a> on sister site ZDNet. Some people, like former Disney employee Justin Garrison, <a href="https://twitter.com/rothgar/status/1337818039799070722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">think</a> it sounds perfect (the hipper, slightly edgier version of RHEL). If you’re a billion-dollar company upset that Red Hat appears to be trying to charge for something you value, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-centos-hello-rocky-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">founder of CentOS has a new way for you to get something for nothing</a>: Rocky Linux.</p>

<p>But if you’re an open source entrepreneur wondering what this means for you, well, Chef cofounder and System Initiative CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Adam Jacob has you covered</a>. In a series of tweets, he walks through how Red Hat’s CentOS strategy can play out for you. (He should know, as the company he co-founded, Chef, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-chefs-100-open-source-move-is-smart-business/" data-absolute="true">last year open sourced everything</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s observe.</p>
<h2>Open source all the things</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob’s first rule</a>? Open it up. Completely. “If I do an open source strategy for a company ever again, I will own the upstream, it will be fully open source, and I’ll happily collaborate with anyone downstream.” But not just an open upstream–it’s also important to, “Produce a commercial distribution [and c]ollaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062321982758912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">argued</a>.</p>
<p>What does he mean by “upstream” and “downstream”? In open source, think of the <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/993/what-does-upstream-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">upstream</a> as the parent, the head, the initial open source project. Downstream might be forks or distributions (packaging up of a particular build of the upstream code) of the upstream.</p>
<p>What Red Hat announced was basically that CentOS would move from being downstream to upstream. It becomes a place, as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062318451068929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob noted</a>, that others <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">like Facebook</a> can collaborate with Red Hat in a way they simply couldn’t before (as Fedora wasn’t closely enough aligned with RHEL). CentOS as a downstream RHEL community was mostly one of users, of consumers, not of collaborators. It was somewhere to get RHEL, but rebranded CentOS, for free.</p>
<p>As such, Jacob pointed out, “They weren’t invested in it beyond using it.” And when someone removes the downstream they get mad “because it’s like someone threatened the water supply,” <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062319558434822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">he argued</a>. It’s therefore far better to condition people to participate as collaborators with an open source project, and through the commercial distribution to also condition users to become customers, if they want the certified distribution.</p>
<h2>Open source + cloud</h2>
<p>One way that open source companies are doing this model to fantastic effect is by open sourcing their upstream and creating a cloud distribution (read: managed service). A variety of companies have embraced this model to greater or lesser extents.</p>
<p>Yugabyte, for example, ditched its Open Core model a year ago and open sourced 100% of its database code. A year later, CTO Karthik Ranganathan told me in an interview, “It increased our adoption like crazy,” growing the number of Yugabyte clusters 10x, but it also has dramatically accelerated their business without them losing any known pipeline. Could someone take that upstream and create a competitive downstream competitor? Of course. But no one should be able to out-Yugabyte on their home turf.</p>
<p>Or take Redis Labs. The company has fiddled with licensing over the last few years, but has kept core Redis completely open while encouraging a growing community (which includes downstream competitors) to lend a hand to improving the code. While Redis Labs doesn’t publish results, its business is booming, even as 10 or so other companies have created competitive downstream managed service offerings.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Jacob: “Run an open upstream from the jump. Produce a commercial distribution. Collaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open.”</p>
<p>That’s the strategy. That’s the magic. You don’t need to go Open Core or any other permutation of kind-of, sort-of open source. You can open source everything and just ensure you have a rock-solid managed cloud service. This reliance on cloud is what’s driving MongoDB, Confluent, DataStax, Redis Labs, and others to great success. It can be your model, too.</p>

<![CDATA[Pijul: Commutation and Scalability]]>

December 21, 2020 | https://pijul.org/posts/2020-12-19-partials/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pijul.org/posts/2020-12-19-partials/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

This week certain industries are reaching a holiday high, and DevOps, SREs, and on call engineers everywhere will have to don their invisible superhero capes and keep us humans and our devices connected, just like they always do.</p><p>At Transposit, we know the pain of on call ourselves, and so we’ve banded together to come up with some of our top tips for making holiday on call shifts as painless as possible.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-one%3A">On Call Tip Number One: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-one%3A">#</a></h2><p>Whether on-callers are planning on having a Rockwellian Christmas, lighting the menorah with Bubbe, visiting family abroad, or taking a tropical trip with the two federal holidays padding their vacation request, there is one consistent truth about the holiday week between Christmas and New Years: Mass exodus from the office. So, before we even get into the challenges of answering a page when no one is around to help you, how can you avoid that conundrum in the first place?</p><p>On call engineering managers should be careful to adjust on call schedules so that the same people are not on call during multiple peak times. Which times are most painful are up to the individual, so giving each person the opportunity to sign up for what works for them first is always a best practice. Perhaps someone doesn’t mind being on call Christmas morning, but absolutely can’t do it on New Years Eve. Start by letting people pick what is ideal for them, and then fill in the remaining gaps, being sure not to unduly burden any one member of the team.</p><p>When making the on call schedule, make sure that there are primaries and secondaries who are committed to each shift, since they will likely be working together without quick access to the rest of the team when something goes wrong.</p><p>To reduce the pain further, consider upping on call bonuses for the entire week as an incentive for taking on undesirable shifts, and once everyone is back in the office in January, be sure to acknowledge the on-callers who responded quickly to keep the business running while everyone else was enjoying their time away from work.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-two%3A">On Call Tip Number Two: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-two%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">Communicate early and often, with and without runbooks. <a href="#communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">#</a></h3><p>Without easy access to the rest of the team, good playbook/runbook documentation during this period is even more important than it is the rest of the year. If your typical on call process involves opening up a collaborative team Slack thread or Jira ticket and then letting various experts or senior SREs weigh in, you might face a rude awakening when your reliable experts are MIA during the holiday week.</p><p>Make sure your runbooks are updated and everyone has easy access to the DevOps systems they need before everyone leaves on vacation, because if on-callers are left to search half-empty wikis by themselves, the speed to resolution is going to be stressful for everyone - engineers, managers, and executives alike.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that primary and secondary on-callers know exactly who they are paired with for a particular shift. Make sure that both are committed to being fully available and sober during their shifts, so that in the absence of the whole team, they are secure in having at least one problem-solving partner.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-three%3A">On Call Tip Number Three: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-three%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="plan-around-potential-travel-problems">Plan around potential travel problems <a href="#plan-around-potential-travel-problems">#</a></h3><p>While it may seem obvious to plan your travel around your on call shifts so that you aren’t in the air while you’re supposed to be available, these days, we sometimes have too much faith in our connectivity during travel. Airports and even some planes have wifi, many airplane seats have built-in electricity and jacks, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Remember, this week is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in the US, so our already strained infrastructure will be at the edge of capacity in the best of circumstances. You won’t be very effective at troubleshooting an outage if you are standing in a 2-hour long airport security line or sitting in a traffic jam on the way up to the mountains. Add unpredictable winter weather to the mix, and we have on call disasters in the making. So, what should on-callers do?</p><p>First, you should plan wider time-frames for travel around your on call shifts to avoid accidentally being unavailable. You also shouldn’t count on access to wifi on your flights (only some planes are equipped, and airlines often shift which plane is flying a certain route based on weather and mechanical issues). Don’t expect access to electricity in the airport to charge your computer or phone, as the high number of travelers may easily keep the charging stations fully occupied, and make sure you have your computer and charger easily accessible, so that if you are forced to gate-check a bag on your crowded flight, you will be sure to keep these precious items on your person.</p><p>Traveling on-callers should also remember that time zones are a thing - your on call planning will need to be adjusted accordingly. If you are the secondary, your primary may be in a different time zone (or vice versa), and you should discuss your plans with them beforehand so that you are prepared for them to be asleep at different hours.</p><p>Finally, if you are traveling anywhere that has inclement weather or otherwise unreliable access to internet, you should have a back-up plan, such as tethering your computer to your phone’s data service to get around unreliable wifi. If you arrive at your destination and realize that you have bad data service, finicky wifi, or (gasp) the possibility of power outages, you should admit your defeat early and find an understanding colleague to take your shift, rather than hoping for the best and leaving any alerts to your back-ups.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-four%3A">On Call Tip Number Four: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-four%3A">#</a></h2><p>We’ve already talked about the importance of secondaries as problem-solving partners, but what about the other, more social challenges of being on call during this time? Let’s say you’re sitting down to a nice family dinner, and, just like you were dreading, there goes your phone dinging with an urgent alert. How are you going to explain this situation to your relatives, who in many cases, don’t really understand what you do?</p><p>This is where a friendly ally can help serve as your secondary within your social situation. If you arm a sibling or supportive partner with talking points to explain why you have to get up from the festive table to crouch frantically over your laptop in the back room, you will be able to focus on troubleshooting without worrying about the familial fallout.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-five%3A">On Call Tip Number Five: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-five%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">Pat yourself and your team on the back <a href="#pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">#</a></h3><p>It should go without saying, and so often it does, that there is a reason the world functions so smoothly during this week, despite its unique circumstances. While a lot of the credit is due to excellent engineering and team planning throughout the rest of the year, there are always unanticipated incidents that simply can’t be avoided. That’s why on call shifts, DevOps, and SREs exist in the first place! And so, as we look back on the year, and the incidents resolved during this special last week of 2019, let’s remember to give a shout out to all the engineering heroes who stepped forward to make it happen. Cheers to you!</p></div></div>]]>

December 21, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  It's 2019 and Lisp stories are on fire at HackerNews. While there exist multiple Lisp dialects, Common Lisp is the
  oldest and most mentioned. Thus, if you're looking to get started with programming in Common Lisp, then there are 2
  options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">portacle</a> to get up and running with SBCL + Emacs.</li>
  <li>
    Use
    <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">roswell</a> to install multiple Lisp implementations + build and bundle
    lisp applications. Roswell installs SBCL by default.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for me, I did not feel like learning a brand new text editor just to get started with Lisp so I went with Roswell.
  Follow the instructions on installing Roswell for your platform. In my case, I decided to install it under
  <code>$HOME/bin</code> on my linux machine via:
</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt install rlwrap
$ mkdir $HOME/bin
$ git clone -b release https://github.com/roswell/roswell.git
$ cd roswell/
$ sh bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin
$ make
$ make install</pre>

<p>
  Make sure to add the roswell path to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (note that roswell installed itself under
  <code>~/bin/bin</code> and if this looks odd to you, install it under <code>$HOME/apps</code> or something of the
  sort):
</p>

<pre>if [ -d "$HOME/bin/bin" ] ; then
  PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"
fi</pre>

<p>
  Open a new terminal and setup roswell:
</p>

<pre>$ which ros
/home/xxx/bin/bin/ros
$ ros --version
roswell 19.06.10.100
$ ros setup </pre>

<p>
  We will now setup VSCode to run lisp. First install the
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattn.Lisp">vscode-lisp</a> extension. Open a new file
  and type the following in:
</p>

<pre>(defun main ()
  (format t "Hello world"))
</pre>

<p>
  Then <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal">launch a terminal</a> inside VSCode. In
  the terminal run <code>rlwrap ros run</code> to start the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop). Select the above defined
  function and use the "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" from the Command Palette (F1) to run your code!
  Note that you can exit the REPL via: <code>(SB-EXT:EXIT)</code>. The <code>rlwrap</code> utility remembers previously
  typed commands which makes for a much nicer REPL experience.
</p>

<p>
  What is amazing about Roswell is that is comes with a scripting / build ability that allows you to easily distribute
  your application. To see this in action first create a roswell script via <code>ros init hello-world</code>. Then add
  in the following code so that your script looks like the following:
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
#|-*- mode:lisp -*-|#
#|
exec ros -Q -- $0 "$@"
|#
(progn ;;init forms
  (ros:ensure-asdf)
  ;;#+quicklisp(ql:quickload '() :silent t)
  )

(defpackage :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541)

(defun helloWorld
  ()
  (format t "Hello world")
)

(defun main (&amp;rest argv)
  (declare (ignorable argv))
  (helloWorld))
;;; vim: set ft=lisp lisp:
</pre>

<p>
  We can now simply run this script via <code>ros hello-world.ros</code> but more interestingly, we can actually compile
  a binary via <code>ros build hello-world.ros &amp;&amp; ./hello-world</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly enough, I am not a complete noob to Common Lisp, I actually programmed it 15 years ago during my
  undergrad years. A colleague and I
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/847c726edff337b818ba86914d9e71b6">compared an experimental genetic algorithm against an ant colony optimization algoritm on a path-finding problem</a>. Once I had lisp running I opened up the project and basically executed <code>ants.lisp</code> in the REPL, ran
  <code>(INITIALIZE-ANT-WORLD)</code> followed by <code>(DISPATCH-ANTS)</code> and voila, my ants were able to find
  their food!
</p>

<p>
  No guide to getting started with Lisp would be complete without a list of further reading that will keep you busy for
  the next 100 years so here we go:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A very basic Lisp <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/learn/first-steps">tutorial</a> which also features an excellent
    <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/books/">list</a> of Lisp books
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/3c02f249908494a961ac4b28e33f1ec5">A road to common lisp</a> - Steve Losh's excellent guide to
    getting into Lisp programming. The following is a small snippet of useful information from the post:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Files are files on your hard drive.
      </li>
      <li>Packages are containers of symbols. They are orthogonal to files.</li>
      <li>
        Systems are collections of code, instructions on how to load that code, dependency lists, and metadata. They are
        orthogonal to packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projects are high-level collections of "stuff" such as code, documentation, maybe some image assets,
        etc. They are (mostly) orthogonal to systems.
      </li>
      <li>Common Lisp itself knows about files and packages.</li>
      <li>ASDF adds systems.</li>
      <li>Quicklisp adds the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    This guide also provides a very nice review of libraries and is definitey worth a read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/cb5d30e9026cba3d1d0b838611d1624c">article</a> that recommends roswell and provides
    instructions for Atom integration along with project and library management.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Well, that's about it - Lisp is beautiful and I'm off to wrap my head around some 15 year old code that doesn't look
  too bad, go functional programming!

      <p>… Let’s talk about something that has haunted me for over a year now.<!--more--></p>

<p>Seeing discussion after discussion, paper after paper, point after point being made about references inside nullable types like <code>variant&lt;T&amp;, monostate&gt;</code>, <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code>, <code>expected&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> and its friends, I am now beyond compelled to speak. The straws that finally tipped me from my year+ hiatus on this subject were <a href="https://wg21.link/p2070">a paper by Professor Peter Sommerlad</a> in the latest C++ mailing, asking for a simplified <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> (and <code>object_ptr</code>) in the interest of safety for MISRA C++-type folk, as well as another paper by James Berrow, who pursued his <a href="https://wg21.link/p2005">objections to the 2D Graphics Proposal with a thorough scholarship</a> that demanded both respect and attention.</p>

<p><code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> (and <code>object_ptr</code>) are minefields. Since MISRA’s paper cites my old paper – <a href="https://wg21.link/p1175">p1175</a> – it seems I can no longer blissfully turn a blind eye and pretend what went down at the November 2018 San Diego meeting just didn’t happen. During that meeting, I explicitly told the room that I would not bring another paper forward to help resolve this issue. I will not be… but I did promise that I would fully vet the design space.</p>

<p>That vetting is done in a yet-unpublished C++ paper <a href="https://thephd.github.io/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/d1683.html">d1683</a>, a secret paper I have been never quite been able to force myself to finish writing. I could not write it because I feel I grossly misled myself and walked into a trap. In fact, I still do feel that way. It makes me feel sick that I am even picking up my pen to once more write about this utter travesty of a topic, most certainly not for the reasons you may expect. In an effort to do a good job and not sabotage Professor Sommerlad’s generally excellent work and consideration, I have bottled (nearly) all of the purely technical observations into <a href="https://thephd.github.io/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/d1683.html">d1683</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this reading is for those of you who can stomach messy, non-technical humanity that birthed the fullness of the viscerally methodical and mechanical understanding I leave for you in the paper. You may stop here if you wish,</p>

<p>though I certainly wish I could stop here with you, dear reader.</p>



<p>In late 2018, I was one meeting fresh of being a “Committee Member”. Brimming with ideas from <a href="https://thephd.github.io/rapperswil-2018-c++-committee-trip-report">my first real interaction</a> with the Committee and incensed by community problems – some listed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lwy4_sKeJM">my second ever recorded conference presentation</a> – I endeavored to tackle lots of “we should clean this up” problems. On that list was putting references inside of <code>std::optional</code>. I only spoke to a few people at C++Now 2018 about the idea, and they nodded their heads and said “this is a solved problem, we should fix it”. If only I had asked the right people at C++Now (literally, just one question at a lunch or break!), I would have known that this was not the case. Of course, there were additional warning signs that I was about to walk into one of the most one-sided fights of my life.</p>

<h3 id="a-deafening-silence">A Deafening Silence</h3>

<p>After attending your first Committee Meeting, dear reader, you get access to what is called “The Reflector”. It’s a fancy name for “private e-mail lists for Committee Members to discuss technical stuff”. Post-Rapperswil I joined the Reflector, verified my access, and then posted my very first message on the Reflector to some 100+ people:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear LEWG,</p>

  <p>I am doing some research on optional references…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody replied.</p>

<p>“It’s okay,” I told myself as I swallowed down my anxiety. “I’m just new and they just don’t feel like talking about it to a newbie about this stuff; there’s a long paper trail after all.” I sent another follow-up e-mail six days later, stating the intent of my research and a link to a survey. Again, my e-mail was met with the sound of my own increasingly shallow and worried breathing, albeit it seemed like they had received the post because some survey results trickled in. I was perplexed and confused. Despite probing a few people here and there to verify <em>did my e-mail actually send?!</em>, I received little to no information about <em>why</em> everyone was so quiet… until a sudden DM later after the survey was published:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Thanks for pursuing this. Regardless of what comes out, it’s a worthwhile effort and it’s probably going to be brutal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… Uh. <em>Excuse</em> me?</p>



<p>Ha! If only I had known that the descriptor ‘brutal’ was, in fact, taking it easy on me. In doing my survey, I journeyed to the dark and unlit places in C++ and gathered information:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2020-01-24/WusDisWusDat%20-%20Mythical%20Lies%20-%20Page%200.jpg" alt="Journeying through the C++ Dark Woods"></p>

<p>I completed the survey with just shy of 130ish participants. 110 responded to the survey directly, 20ish people and companies – including the original author of Boost.Tuple, Boost <code>reference_wrapper</code>, <code>std::reference_wrapper</code>, and more – replied either on a public mailing list to certain pieces / direct inquiries, or VIA private e-mail. As I reviewed the results, a steady drip of indignation slowly filled me. The reason, dear reader, was that I had been lied to. Everyone was lied to for at least 13 years by counting to the November 2018 San Diego meeting, and nearly 15 years to today’s very date.</p>



<p>If you read the technical paper, dear reader, you’ll see a detailed writing about the two most prominent directions that are <em>always</em> brought up when someone talks about references in X-or-Value style wrappers like <code>expected</code>, <code>variant</code>, and <code>optional</code>. There are actually four directions in total, but we will use the two most often discussed: the “Assign-through” <code>optional</code> direction, and the “Rebind” <code>optional</code> direction.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, observe the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;optional&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>24</span><span>;</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>optional</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span> <span>opt</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

	<span>opt</span> <span>=</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"x is "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"y is "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>y</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>endl</span><span>;</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some people will shout from the rooftops that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should be <code>24</code> (the optional “assigns through” itself and into the referred-to object). Others say that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should be <code>5</code> and <code>24</code>, respectively (the optional “rebinds” to another object, like <code>std::reference_wrapper</code>). This “ambiguity” of potential semantic choices led to a figurative holy war breaking out in not only Boost when this was first proposed, but in the Committee when it was brought up again. Back almost 15 years ago from today in Boost, Fernando Cacciola – the originator of Boost.Optional – had <a href="https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2005/10/95487.php">this discussion and debate</a>. The full discussion – if you hunt <a href="https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2005/10/95079.php">down all the pieces</a> – was over 100 e-mails long and featured some of today’s prominent (and today’s currently retired) C++ giants like Alisdair Meredith, Beman Dawes, Eric Niebler, and others.</p>

<p>The decision Boost made earlier was that <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> should rebind. This was based on a fact that Jonathan Müller observed over a decade later in his talk Rethinking Pointers and <a href="https://foonathan.net/blog/2018/07/12/optional-reference.html">more explicitly in a blog</a> on his opinions on <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> and why assign-through was the <em>wrong</em> behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now some people think that having that behavior in the <code>operator=</code> of <code>optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</code> itself is even a possibility they need to consider.</p>

  <p>It isn’t.</p>

  <p>It absolutely isn’t.</p>

  <p>Ignoring any other counter argument, those semantics would lead to confusion as <code>operator=</code> would do completely different things depending on the state of the <code>optional</code>!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he’s right:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>optional</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span> <span>maybe_obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// blah blah </span>
	<span>// work ...</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>some_condition</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>int</span> <span>better_obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>
		<span>maybe_obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>better_obj</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
	<span>// blah blah</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Imagine this code has a value for <code>maybe_obj</code> in the 95% case. You test it and it works for the cases you care about. Then, one day, <code>some_condition</code> becomes <code>true</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>maybe_obj</code> is empty; the double-whammy you never prepared you or your code for. Well, now you have a dangling reference to <code>better_obj</code> inside <code>some_condition</code>, a problem that is rarely discovered because you might use it in the time before the value becomes some wild overwritten garbage and still just “happens” to contain the value you like anyways and ships just fine. It’s a dangling reference to a stack variable – a vulnerability waiting to happen – but it compiles, runs, and ships.</p>

<p>In a rebinding world, that code is <em>always</em> wrong, and <em>always</em> gets rejected. Not by the compiler, no, but by Code Review, the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cor3ntin/status/1219897942343081986">upcoming <code>-Wlifetime</code></a>, and other tools. Static analyzers can sniff this in a heartbeat and issue a <em>hard</em> error, telling you to fix your mistake. If you have any degree of code auditing, testing, or checking, this will blow up right quick and can always be flagged down as “this is wrong, stop”.</p>

<p>In an assign-through world, dear reader, no static analyzer can diagnose that code with 100% certainty because Maybe That Is What You Intended But Why On God’s Holy Green Goddamned Earth Would You Write Code To Do This?! But there is an even more sinister way of writing this that looks correct, smells correct, and behaves mostly correct until it does not:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>optional</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span> <span>cache</span><span>::</span><span>retrieve</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>optional</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span> <span>opt</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>get_default_resource_maybe</span><span>();</span>
	<span>// blah blah work</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>found_a_thing</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lookup_resource</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>found_a_thing</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>int</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>resource</span> <span>=</span> 
		  <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>get_specific_resource</span><span>(</span><span>found_a_thing</span><span>);</span>
		<span>// do stuff with resource, return</span>
		<span>opt</span> <span>=</span> <span>resource</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>opt</span><span>;</span> <span>// optional says if we got something!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In both an assign-through world and a rebinding world, this code works. Unfortunately, they work in different ways. In the Rebinding world if you do not have a cached default resource, assigning into <code>opt</code> will re-point to <code>resource</code>. It also happens if there is a resource, too, taking <code>opt</code> and rebinding it to point at the specific <code>resource</code> in the <code>found_a_thing</code> conditional.</p>

<p>The empty case is the same for assign-through (it rebinds, because there is no other option). But if you have a default resource, <em>then that resource will be <strong>overwritten</strong> by the assignment</em>. This is by far the most sinister bug: subtle overwrites of default resources for seemingly innocuous code that is, by a decent eyeballing of it, non-offensive. Not even a static analyzer can tell you this isn’t what you meant to do. And yet, it is the thing that bit people who implemented assign-through optionals.</p>

                <div><p><em>Following this guide, you only need to change a single line of code to train an <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">object detection model</a> on your own dataset.</em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/chess-detection-longer.gif" alt=""><figcaption>In our guided example, we'll train a model to recognize chess pieces. (Full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLispu-Yb_0">video</a>)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5</a> was released recently. You may also want to consider visiting our post on <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/">how to train YOLO v5 in PyTorch tutorial</a> as it gets much better results than YOLO v3.</p><p><a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection">Object detection models</a> are extremely powerful—from finding dogs in photos to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05747.pdf">improving healthcare</a>, training computers to recognize which pixels constitute items unlocks near limitless potential. However, one of the biggest blockers keeping new applications from being built is adapting state-of-the-art, open source, and free resources to solve custom problems.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk through how to prepare a custom dataset for object detection using tools that simplify image management, architecture, and training. In each section, we’ll first follow what I’ve done for a specific example and and then detail what modifications you’ll need to make for your custom dataset. My recommendation is that you follow along step-by-step to duplicate my process before adapting these steps to your problem.</p><p>Let’s start with a clear description of our process.</p><p>Any given machine learning problem begins with a well-formed problem statement, data collection and preparation, model training and improvement, and inference. Often, our process is not strictly linear. For instance, we may find our model performs very poorly on one type of image label, and we need to revisit collecting more data on that example.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/data-process.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>The general machine learning workflow.</em></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2><p>Chess is a fun game of wit and strategy. Improving your playing ability requires understanding where you’ve previously made notable mistakes and what move(s) a superior player to you may have made in the same situation. </p><p>Thus, having a system that recognizes the state of the game and records each move would be valuable. This requires not just determining what a given chess piece is, but where that piece is on the board—a leap from image recognition to object detection. For the purposes of this post, we will constrain the problem to focus on the object detection portion: <u>can we train a model to identify which chess piece is which and to which player (black or white) the pieces belong, and a model that finds at least half of the pieces in inference.</u></p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/computer-vision-problems-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image Processing Problems, adapted from Stanford’s CS231N course</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem statement</em>, consider constraining the problem space to a specific piece. Moreover, consider the minimal acceptable criteria for the model’s performance. (In this example, we are constraining to just the identification of correct bounding boxes, and setting a relatively low bar for acceptable criteria. To be more rigorous, we may want to identify our model’s <a href="https://giou.stanford.edu/">IOU</a> or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">mAP</a> - but that is for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">a different post</a>.)</p><hr><h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2><p>To identify chess pieces, we need to collect and annotate chess images.</p><p>I made a few assumptions in my data collection. First, all my images were captured from the same angle. I set up a tripod on the table near my chess board. For inference, this would require that my camera is at the same angle as the training data was captured — and not all chess players may be setting up tripods before their games. Second, I created 12 different classes: one for each of the six pieces times the two colors.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/IMG_0167.JPG" alt=""><figcaption>An (unlabeled) image example from our dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, I collected 292 images. I labeled all the pieces in each of these images, totaling 2894 <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/glossary/#:~:text=annotation">annotations</a>. This <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/chess-full">chess dataset</a> is publicly available on <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a>. For labelling, there are many high quality, free, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/getting-started-with-labelimg-for-labeling-object-detection-data/">open source tools available like LabelImg</a>. I happened to use <a href="https://rectlabel.com/">RectLabel</a>, which is $3/month.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/01/rectLabel-example.png" alt=""><figcaption><em>An example image I labeled in RectLabel.</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>For your non-chess problem</em>, consider collecting images that are in-context of where your model will perform in production. This means ensuring you have a similar angles, lighting, quality, and objects in frame. The more situations your training set takes into account that your model may encounter in production, the better its performance will be. When labelling, it is best to draw bounding boxes that include the entirety of your objects, even if there’s a small amount of space between the object and the bounding box. Simply put, do not cut out any of the underlying object with your bounding boxes. If one piece blocks view (occludes) that of another, label as though you could see the full object (see the white-bishop and white-rook example above).</p><p>If you’re seeking already annotated images, consider <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection">object detection datasets</a> on sites like <a href="https://public.roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Public Datasets</a> which hosts a variety of free, high quality datasets.</p><hr><h2 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h2><p>Going straight from data collection to model training leads to suboptimal results. There may be problems with the data. Even if there aren’t, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tag/augmentation/">applying image augmentation</a> expands your dataset and reduces overfitting.</p><p>Preparing images for object detection includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Verifying your annotations are correct (e.g. none of the annotations are out of frame in the images)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/exif-auto-orientation/">Ensuring the EXIF orientation of your images is correct</a> (i.e. your images are stored on disk differently than how you view them in applications, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21207411">see more</a>)</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/you-might-be-resizing-your-images-incorrectly/">Resizing images and updating image annotations to match</a> the newly sized images</li><li>Various color corrections that may improve model performance like <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-grayscale-as-a-preprocessing-step/">grayscale</a> and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-contrast-as-a-preprocessing-step/">contrast adjustments</a></li><li>Formatting annotations to match the requirements of your model’s inputs (e.g. generating <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-create-to-a-tfrecord-file-for-computer-vision/">TFRecords for TensorFlow</a> or a flat text file for some <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4">implementations of YOLO</a>).<br></li></ul><p>Similar to tabular data, cleaning and augmenting image data can improve your ultimate model’s performance more than architectural changes in your model.</p><p><a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow Organize</a> is purpose-built to seamlessly solve these challenges.

Auto-orient is important because images are sometimes stored on disk in different orientations than the applications we use to view them.

This specific model is a one-shot learner, meaning each image only passes through the network once to make a prediction, which allows the architecture to be very performant, viewing up to 60 frames per second in predicting against video feeds. Fundamentally, <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov3-keras">YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> that divides an image into subcomponents, and conducts convolutions on each of those subcomponents before pooling back to create a prediction.

		<article>
			<p>Consider the meetup speaker.  She’s had a topic in mind for while, and so when the request went out for speakers, she volunteered.  But that was three months ago, and now the meetup’s only a few weeks away, and she hasn’t even begun.  She starts to outline the talk, but can’t quite figure out where to start.  She can explain all the details easily, but the order in which they should be introduced, the organizing structure of the talk, remains elusive.  Giving a talk about a subject, it turns out, is not the same as having a conversation about it.</p>

<p>Consider the first-time meetup attendee.  He’s been interested in the technology for a few months, but there doesn’t seem to be any guides that help him progress from the ubiquitous “hello world” or “distributed word count” examples to actual, effective production usage.  Maybe, he thinks, there will be some people at the meetup who can guide him through this awkward adolescence.  So after a long day at work, he wanders over to the meetup space, where everyone’s hanging around the open pizza boxes.  A few are eyeing the kegerator in the corner, wondering if it’s off-limits.  He stands next to them and eats his pizza, listening to their conversation, wondering if he should introduce himself or just wait for the talk to begin.</p>

<p>Consider the long-time meetup attendee.  He’s been using the technology for a few years, and wants its adoption to grow, so every month he comes to the meetup, eats the pizza, makes small talk with the other regular attendees, and dutifully listens to the talk.  The talk, unfortunately, is usually either too remedial or focused on something not very relevant to his day-to-day usage.  Also, the talks tend to be scattered, introducing concepts out of order, with lots of mental throat-clearing as the speaker tries to remember what was going through their head when they made the slide.  Usually within ten minutes half the audience is looking at their laptops, with only the occasional glance up to confirm that the talk is, in fact, still going on.  He attends almost every month, and often leaves wondering why he bothers.</p>

<p>In this based-on-a-true-story scenario, everyone’s motivations are good: they want to educate and to learn, to nurture and grow the community, to meet people who share their enthusiasm.  And yet, a typical meetup is at best weakly successful in all of these dimensions.  This is for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Any growing community is at least half-filled with novices.</strong>  Very few assumptions can be made about what vocabulary and concepts are universally understood.  The speaker needs to make a conscious choice to either build up from first principles, greatly delaying the time it takes to get to the actual topic at hand, or leave a significant part of the audience behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding something well enough to use it doesn’t mean you can explain it well.</strong>  We should all aspire to a clarity of understanding that lets us easily explain an idea to people from a variety of backgrounds, but that doesn’t come for free.  Details need to be synthesized into broader concepts, without losing sight of the practical knowledge necessary to apply those concepts.  Unsurprisingly, speakers are often still ascending that learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>The standard lecture format expects and enforces passive participation.</strong> Ostensibly the attendees are making an active choice to learn and grow by attending a meetup, but upon arriving all that’s expected of them is to eat and listen.  Each attendee likely has interests and projects of their own, but unless the talk directly addresses them, any discussion must be crammed into the margins of the meetup - either before, when people are eating and the speaker is fussing with the projector, or after, when the hosts are tidying up and giving not-so-subtle looks to everyone who’s lingering.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lecture format still has value, of course, but much less so than its widespread usage would suggest.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like a State</a>, James Scott contrasts two Ancient Greek words for knowledge, <em>techne</em> and <em>metis</em>.  <em>Techne</em> is universal and timeless: the Pythagorean theorem and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis">harmony of the spheres</a>.  <em>Metis</em> is local and contextual: Odysseus infiltrating Troy and escaping the Cyclops.  Our educations are anchored in <em>techne</em> - data structures, algorithms, and exams with objectively correct answers - but upon entering the real world, we find the <em>techne</em> only takes us so far.  The problems we solve are not universal, they’re bounded by the context of our particular domains.  This is fortunate, because needing to solve the general form of every problem we come across would slow our work to a standstill.  However, this means our <em>metis</em> is unavoidably tangled up in the context in which we developed it.</p>

<p>Looking back, leaving the <em>techne</em> of school for the <em>metis</em> of our jobs can feel like a fall from grace.  What was once clear is now hopelessly muddled, littered with a thousand half-remembered details.  The promise of the lecture format is a return to that higher plane, an escape from the endless minutiae that awaits below.  And yet, most of what we’ve learned in our careers is within that minutiae.  There is enormous practical knowledge available at every meetup, and the lecture format uses almost none of it.</p>

<p>And so, at Factual we’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">a Clojure meetup</a> modeled on a different academic tradition: office hours.  At a university, students who have questions about the lecture content or coursework can visit the professor, and have a one-on-one conversation.  This can be enormously freeing for both parties: the student can ask questions without fear of looking stupid or holding up the rest of the class, and the professor can focus on giving an explanation that makes sense to this particular student, rather than the entire class.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every meetup, we give everyone a name tag, and provide a whiteboard with two columns, “teachers” and “students”.  Attendees are encouraged to put their name and interests in both columns.  From there, everyone can eat their food and read the whiteboard, and go in search of someone from the opposite column who shares their interests.  Typically they form groups of two or three, sometimes with a few more people listening in.</p>

<p>We’ve only had three meetups so far, each time with around twenty attendees, but the results have been promising.  It has been especially encouraging seeing novice Clojure users bring in their first project to get a critique of their approaches, and discuss how they can better use Clojure’s core abstractions.  These are precisely the sorts of conversations that create a healthy, growing community.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what the maximum practical size for this sort of meetup is.  Given the small size of each group it may scale fairly well, but at some point it becomes impossible for people to find each other.  Some sort of pre-event registration where people list their interests, and popular topics are assigned a physical location, may offset this.  However, for the vast majority of tech meetups, where the attendees number in the dozens rather than hundreds, this can be an enormously useful and engaging alternative to the lecture format.  We encourage everyone to give it a try.  And if you find yourself in San Francisco and have even a passing interest in Clojure, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">give us a visit</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to do interesting work, a great starting point is to work on things you find interesting. Instead of trying to optimize for what you think others are likely to find interesting—chasing the market is a Sisyphean task—just keep digging deeper into what <i>you</i>&nbsp;find interesting.</p><p>That way, making your work interesting to others is simply a matter of sharing your enthusiasm. I took a geology class my freshman year of college. It’s easy to imagine how boring a class about rocks could be. But my professor <i>loved</i>&nbsp;rocks. She had contributed to the discovery of plate tectonics. She took us up into the mountains and showed us how you could decode geological layers laid bare by erosion to reveal the violence and wonder of how the Earth took shape. She could forge a path through the entire universe starting from a single grain of sand. Another professor could have taught the same curriculum to no effect. My professor’s love for the material brought it to life. She used her enthusiasm to ignite our curiosity.</p><p>But working on things you find interesting is not sufficient to make your work interesting to other people. We’ve all been bored to death by experts who speak in impenetrable acronyms or super-fans who get lost in their own rabbit holes. Their individual interest in the material may be genuine, but it isn’t contagious because they lack empathy. You (probably) wouldn’t tell a dirty joke to your grandmother in the same way you’d tell it to your best friend. Empathy is meeting people where they are so you can take them someplace new. That’s why rock stars shout out the name of the city they happen to be performing in. Despite her academic fame and scientific expertise, my geology professor didn’t get stuck in solipsistic obsession. Instead, she <i>used</i>&nbsp;her enthusiasm as a tool to inspire her students, to pry open new worlds for us. As a result, we found her work tremendously interesting.</p><p>So doing interesting work doesn’t require guessing what others might like or a benevolent hiring manager offering you your dream job. Doing interesting work requires working on things you find interesting, and then cultivating sufficient empathy to find effective ways to share your enthusiasm with the right people. Empathy is the catalyst that makes curiosity contagious. You’ll know you’re doing it right when the people you seek to reach find your work at least as interesting as you do.</p><p>*</p><p>Complement with <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/12/quantity-is-route-to-quality-not-its.html">Quantity is a route to quality, not its opposite</a>, <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/10/lasting-value.html">Lasting value</a>, and <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/2020/07/creativity-is-choice.html">Creativity is a choice.</a></p><p><b>Get new posts delivered straight to your inbox:</b></p><!--Begin MailChimp Signup Form-->

<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet?

<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d8aeadbd98b6bda0ac">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>My daily driver is a desktop that I originally built as a Hackintosh for my wife's use. She outgrew it a year
or so ago for a new iMac, and I inherited it. Over the year, I've been using macOS less and less, and have spent
much more time on the dual-booted Windows 10 installation, especially since WSL is getting better and better
all the time. It's almost not painful to use for just about all the coding, writing, and occasional photography
or design projects I undertake.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I noticed while doing some file cleanup that there really was a terrific lot of crap that had
accumulated on the Windows drive. I'm fairly certain that this drive started out as a Windows 7 install, then
probably skipped Windows 8 and has been on Windows 10 through several Insider Ring upgrades over the years.
Anyway, I thought I'd just finish my backup and then re-install Windows to have a nice clean start. At the same
time, I figured since I wasn't really using the macOS installation that much, I'd move that one to a slower SATA
SSD and move Windows over to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KGpd3x">Western Digital 500GB NVMe M.2 drive</a> that previously
hosted the Hackintosh boot drive.</p>
<p>Based on my recollection of the last time I'd installed/updated Windows, it seemed like a reasonable afternoon
project that should be pretty straightforward. As it turns out, the actual installation of Windows 10 is even quicker
than I had remembered, but the getting to the point where installation was possible was more than I bargained for.</p>
<p>This is a write-up because I ran into a few problems that were difficult to find great answers for, and I'm sure
there's someone else out there who will get into a similar situation. That someone is most likely to be a future
version of me…</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 install media</strong></p>
<p>This is the easy part. I remembered having had issues in the past with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Windows Media Creation Tool</a>,
and so I went out of my way to download the plain old ISO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: if you want to do this you need to
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/">spoof your User-Agent</a>
if you're on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-pro-tip: you probably don't need to do this. I ended up using WMCT and had no issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, if you want to get the ISO then you'll probably want something like <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to help
you burn it into a USB thumb drive. As I mentioned above, during the course of about 15 installation attempts,
I ended up recreating the bootable media with WMCT and that's the version I ultimately successfully used. The
other failures weren't due to the ISO or Rufus, but it's probably easier to just use WMCT unless you have some
other burning reason not to.</p>
<p><strong>Hard drive prep</strong></p>
<p>I had already cleaned everything I needed off of the M.2 drive, and had reformatted it before leaving macOS.
The drive doesn't need to be in any particular state, format, or partitioning scheme - you can take care
of that in the Windows installer.</p>
<p>Some motherboards have little quirks about whether you can actually have more than one M.2 drive connected,
and if so, what other SATA ports you might lose access to, or which other PCIe slots get degraded lanes or
just stop working altogether. In my case, I'd already connected it up correctly several years ago and didn't
need to make any changes, but worth checking if you're using the M.2 drive for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS prep</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to skip all of the many, many things I tried that didn't work with BIOS settings for this, and
just make note of what I ended up finding was important. Obviously all BIOSs are different and so this won't
be an exact prescription unless you also happen to have a GIGABYTE GA-Z170X-UD5 on F21 BIOS version, but
it may be helpful nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>CSM needs to be turned off.</strong> This is Compatibility Support Module, and it (possibly among other things) will
force the boot media into MBR mode, and not UEFI mode. You want UEFI mode unless your motherboard is somehow
so old that it's not enabled. But if that were the case you're probably not trying to install Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>If you have CSM enabled, it's very likely that you'll see an error message like “Windows cannot be installed to this disk.
The selected disk is of the GPT partition style.”</p>

            <p>This may mean you have CSM enabled</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also needed to set <strong>Secure Boot to Disabled</strong> otherwise I couldn't even get to the BIOS screen… I needed to
hard-reset the CMOS a few times before I figured this out definitively.</p>
<p>The final setting that mattered was the <strong>“Windows 8/10 Features”</strong>, which needed to be set to “Windows 8/10”.
The WHQL setting isn't needed, and the “Other OS” had been my previous setting when the boot manager was
Clover from the Hackintosh EFI partition, but didn't work with a Windows EFI boot loader.</p>
<p>I also had “Fast Boot” turned off, but I don't think it should matter either way. All these settings (in my BIOS)
were under the tab labeled “BIOS”.</p>

<p>I don't know why this is a problem. Others seem to have it as well, but not consistently. I don't know if
it's related to this being a clean install with multiple internal hard drives connected, or to something
about USB 3.x vs USB 2.0 for the installer media, or maybe something entirely different. Either way, as I made
it through the initial few steps of the Windows 10 installation, I kept running into a failure with the error
message “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation. To install Windows,
restart the installation.” Of course, restarting the installation doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>Before getting to this point, I had used the partition manager in the installer to delete all partitions from
the target NVMe drive, then chose the Unallocated Space on which to install Windows. I also tried creating
the partitions manually myself, with the same error message.</p>
<p>After much swearing both at the installer and the garbage that is the Microsoft Community Forums, I finally
found my way to a gentleman who went by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a26b9f6-6f40-419f-a7bd-9fc6389899c8?sort=LastReplyDate&amp;dir=Desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;forum=allcategories&amp;meta=&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=undefined&amp;postedBefore=undefined&amp;threadType=All&amp;page=1">RichardKay1</a> and seemed
to have not only the same exact problem as I, but also a solution that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-10-fresh-install-fails/f9614ae4-6dbd-4715-9a81-8586b16dfaf7?page=2">looked like it might have merit</a>.</p>
<p>His steps outlined on the forum were not exact, and mostly dealt with the <code>diskpart</code> utility, with which
I am not all that familiar, so I also spent some time trying to figure out how to safely use that tool
without deleting all the data on the 4 other disks that I had connected still.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro-tip: probably safer to disconnect all the other disks you're not using for the actual install
before messing around with <code>diskpart</code>. Unless you're very careful. Or brave/stupid.
I decline to identify into which category I fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: <code>diskpart</code> can seriously ruin your day. BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU HIT ENTER. You have been warned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. RichardKay1, the root cause is that the USB installer <em>actually</em> tries to install Windows
onto the same USB stick, despite me having chosen an internal drive as the target. I don't really know how
to verify this, but regardless, his solution worked.</p>

<p>This is the key takeaway to solve the “Windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase
of installation”. Or it was in my case, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Reformat the target drive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the USB installer (I assume you can do this, else you probably the target audience.).</li>
<li>Select the language, time, and keyboard type, click Next.</li>
<li>Click “Repair your computer”, then “Troubleshoot”, then “Command Prompt”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This puts you on the X: drive (temporary RAM disk with some command line utilities) and able to access
the rest of the connected drives. First step is to fully erase the target disk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: it's up to you to choose the correct disks, and make sure that erasing them is actually what you
want to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>From the command prompt, type <code>diskpart</code> to start the utility. You'll get a little prompt like <code>DISKPART&gt;</code>
and not much else.</li>
<li>Type <code>list disk</code> to show all disks, and identify (by size or whatever) which is your target.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list disk

  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt

<ol start="6">
<li>Type <code>select disk 2</code> to choose this disk for manipulation.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: the next step will erase EVERYTHING on the disk you have selected!</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Type <code>clean</code> to erase all partitions on this disk. If you run <code>list disk</code> again after this you should
see that the value in the “Free” column has gone up to the full drive capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prep the internal drive</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>We eventually want to boot in UEFI mode, and so need the partition scheme to be GPT. Type
<code>convert gpt</code> to accomplish this.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where I diverged a bit from the forum answer. I wanted to create a EFI partition manually so that
I could keep it big enough to later use <code>grub</code> for a dual-boot Linux install, and also to get the EFI partition
in the right spot on the disk so when I collapsed partitions later I wouldn't leave a gap.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Create an EFI partition with <code>create partition EFI size=500</code> (size is in MB).</li>
<li>Format the EFI partition to FAT32 (important) with <code>format FS=FAT32 label=System</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that EFI was ready to go, I wanted to create a ~10GB partition to hold the install media that was currently
on the USB thumb drive. The process is similar to creating the EFI partition except that it's a ‘primary’ partition
and formatted as NTFS:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Create installer partition with <code>create partition primary size=10000</code>.</li>
<li>Format installer partition with <code>format quick FS=NTFS label=Installer</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, I needed to access files on both the installer USB and also on the new internal partition. To do that
I needed to assign a drive letter.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To see what letters are assigned, type <code>list volume</code></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmd">DISKPART<span></span>&gt; list volume

  Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info
  ----------  ---  …</code></pre></div></div></div>

December 20, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/21/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>a popular trend in the Rust community is to ask "Are We X Yet" for various things that it would be nice to be able to develop easily in Rust - <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">game</a> and <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">web</a> are the most prominent ones as far as i can tell - and one such question is <a href="https://areweguiyet.com/">Are We GUI Yet</a>.
that's a good question; <em>are</em> we GUI yet?
Are We GUI Yet has a list of libraries for building GUIs: let's go through them in alphabetical order and see if we can build a simple to-do list with them without too much struggle.</p>
<p>some notes before we get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>this is all extremely subjective.</li>
<li>the only ui toolkits i have used and not hated are Swing (i know), Electron (<em>i know</em>), and wxWidgets, which doesn't have Rust bindings because Rust bindings to C++ libraries are generously described as a nuisance to create (i've tried, and i'm writing this post instead of trying harder).
as such, i might be using some of these wrong, who knows.</li>
<li>i use windows, and so anything that's a nuisance to set up on windows is not going to fare well regardless of how cool it is once you get it working.
it could be the best thing since sliced bread or Meteor on release and i wouldn't care.
do not @ me.</li>
<li>the people who wrote these libraries have done more than i have to make the rust gui ecosystem not suck, and i don't want any of this to come across as suggesting that they suck and their work is bad.
the strongest thing i want to say is that a library is not designed in a way that i would want it to be designed, or that it doesn't work for me.
doing this shit at all is really goddamn difficult, and i don't want to minimize that by being unhappy with the results.</li>
<li>i started drafting this post in early July 2020, and finished it in late August 2020.
some things may have changed in the meantime while i wasn't paying attention.</li>
</ol>
<h2>azul</h2>
<p>first on our list is <a href="https://azul.rs/">azul</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A free, functional, immediate-mode GUI framework for rapid development of desktop applications written in Rust, supported by the Mozilla WebRender rendering engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the wiki says we need cmake installed, which is never a good sign, but conveniently, i've already got that set up on my computer, for reasons i forget but probably didn't enjoy.
the runtime dependencies on linux are a mile long, but fortunately i don't have to care.
azul isn't currently available on crates.io for reasons that presumably exist but are difficult to explain, so we have to add it directly as a git dependency.</p>
<p>once we've got it added as a dependency, we can attempt to run our test crate, just to make sure everything's not on fire. unfortunately:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error: failed to run custom build command for `servo-freetype-sys v4.0.5`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `D:\Melody\Projects\we-are-not-gui-yet\target\debug\build\servo-freetype-sys-1fae054761ff82c5\build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
running: "cmake" &lt;snip&gt;

--- stderr
CMake Error: Could not create named generator Visual Studio 16 2019
</pre></div>
<p>this is an inauspicious beginning.
one version history crawl later and it looks like my cmake is from April 2019, which is not all that old but maybe they hadn't caught up on the latest visual studio yet, who knows.
this is already more work than i was prepared to do, but i've come this far, so it's time to update my cmake.</p>
<p>okay one installer later and it's time to try again.
armed with a cmake from May 2020, let's give this another shot:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
   --&gt; C:\Users\Melody\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\webrender_api-0.60.0\src\display_list.rs:270:35
    |
270 |             let reader = bincode::IoReader::new(UnsafeReader::new(&amp;mut self.data));
    |                                   ^^^^^^^^ could not find `IoReader` in `bincode`
</pre></div>
<p>welp.
the cmake update fixed things, i guess, but now we've got a whole other pile of mess.
this might be fixable, it may have been fixed by the time you read this.
regardless, this library does not work for me.</p>
<h2>conrod</h2>
<p>next up is <a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod">conrod</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An easy-to-use, 2D GUI library written entirely in Rust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i've actually used this one before in a couple of projects, but it's been a minute, so i forget the details.</p>
<p>they do not have a real tutorial, which is unfortunate, but they do have some examples.
unfortunately, step one is to pick which of the half dozen backends i want.
do i want glium or vulkano or rendy or piston?
do i look like i know what a vulkano is?
i just want a picture of a <a href="https://youtu.be/EvKTOHVGNbg">god dang hot dog</a>.
okay that's not quite fair, i recognize three of those and can infer from context what the fourth one is, but that's only because i've been down this road before, and i still have no clue which one is the right one to pick.
all the examples live under glium, though, so let's go with that.</p>
<p>wait actually i'm staring at these examples and there's an entire ass event loop in the support code for the examples.
something in here mentions a <code>GliumDisplayWinitWrapper</code> and i'm scared.
i have literally used this library before - on two different projects - and i'm at a loss.
i don't want to just copy and paste the examples without actually understanding what's going on, i can't understand what's going on in the examples, and there's nowhere else to get started.
so there goes that i guess.</p>
<h2>core-foundation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Bindings to Core Foundation for macOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh hey, it's an OS i don't have access to at all.
next.</p>
<h2>druid</h2>
<p>our next contender is <a href="https://linebender.org/druid/">druid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Druid is a framework for building simple graphical applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>apparently this sprung out of that vi-like text editor a couple googlers were working on, so apparently it's at least possible to use it for real software.
there's a tutorial, they're on crates.io, they're describing it as "conceptually simple and largely non-magical" which i am always a fan of, i am cautiously optimistic.
if we throw it in our dependencies and just see if anything breaks, we find the surprising result that everything just works.</p>
<p>oh hey the first real chapter in the tutorial starts with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is outdated, and should be replaced with a walkthrough of getting a simple app built and running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you love to see it.
fortunately, we can just ignore that and skip to the hello world example, reproduced here in its entirety:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>{</span><span>AppLauncher</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>WindowDesc</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>};</span><span></span>
<span>use</span><span> </span><span>druid</span>::<span>widget</span>::<span>Label</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>build_ui</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Label</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>PlatformError</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>AppLauncher</span>::<span>with_window</span><span>(</span><span>WindowDesc</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>build_ui</span><span>)).</span><span>launch</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>and somehow, this actually works.</p>
<p>the tutorial ends here, which is unfortunate, but there's more documentation, including explanations of core concepts with examples that are... todo lists!
with even more features than what i was planning to include here!
so that's convenient.
the UI hierarchy is based on CSS Flexbox, which i also appreciate.
this is what peak UI layout API looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>build_new_todo</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Widget</span><span>&lt;</span><span>TodoState</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>textbox</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>TextBox</span>::<span>new</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_placeholder</span><span>(</span><span>"New todo"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>lens</span><span>(</span><span>TodoState</span>::<span>next_todo</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Button</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Add"</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>on_click</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>data</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>TodoState</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>create_todo</span><span>());</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Flex</span>::<span>row</span><span>()</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_flex_child</span><span>(</span><span>textbox</span><span>.</span><span>expand_width</span><span>(),</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>.</span><span>with_child</span><span>(</span><span>button</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>1 hour and 80 lines of code later, we've got ourselves a perfectly valid and working todo list!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.boringcactus.com/assets/2020-08-21-survey-of-rust-gui-libraries-1.png" alt="our sample druid application, showing a todo list"></p>
<p>i'm not quite happy with this, though: we can type text and hit the button and it adds the todo, but pressing enter in the text field doesn't do anything.
there's no way out-of-the-box to make that happen; let's see if we can build that ourselves.</p>
<p>~30 lines of code later, we've got it!
the <code>Controller</code> trait is designed for exactly this sort of thing, when you need to wrap the behavior of an existing component and intercept some events to inject your own logic.</p>
<p>if you're curious, you can take a look at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~boringcactus/survey-of-rust-gui-libraries/tree/main/druid-test">the source for our druid example</a>.</p>
<p>so apparently druid is actually pretty darn usable.
i only have a couple tiny issues with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>it doesn't use platform native UI widgets, so it doesn't look quite like a windows app should, and it won't look quite like a mac or linux app should either if i test it there.
this one is a feature as far as some people are concerned, but i am not on that list.</li>
<li>accessibility features like being able to tab between UI widgets (<em>update 2020-12-14</em>: and also literally any screen reader support) are missing, so you'd have to roll those yourself in a real application.
 maybe they'll add that by default in future versions, maybe not, but it would be neat if it existed.</li>
<li>high-level documentation is incomplete.
the individual struct/function docs are really good, but at a high level you don't really have a convenient place to jump in.</li>
</ol>
<p>i was about to add "no support for web" to that list, but even though the high-level docs don't mention it, the crate root docs and the examples do.
on the plus side, it just works, and i didn't have to make any changes to my code because i use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/pull/736">this patch to wasm-pack that lets you just use binary crates in wasm-pack</a> even though it hasn't been merged yet upstream.
on the minus side, it points everything at a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag, which means you get none of the accessibility features of actually using the DOM.
so that one's a mixed bag.</p>
<p>but yeah, overall druid is perfectly usable for gui development.
i was originally calling this post "we are not gui yet" but i guess we are at least a little bit gui already.
pleasant surprises are the best kind.</p>
<h2>fltk</h2>
<p>following up that success is <a href="https://github.com/MoAlyousef/fltk-rs">fltk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FLTK crate is a crossplatform lightweight gui library which can be statically linked to produce small, self-contained and fast gui applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cross-platform and statically linked are both good things.
the upstream FLTK website makes my eyes bleed, which is never a good sign for a UI library, but that doesn't mean much one way or the other.
the simple hello world example is once again a mere handful of lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>fltk</span>::<span>{</span><span>app</span>::<span>*</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>window</span>::<span>*</span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>app</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>App</span>::<span>default</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>wind</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Window</span>::<span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3…</span></pre></div></div></div>

    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>"nxt"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h4>This classic article from Mario Wolczko first
appeared on Usenet in 1986.  </h4>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf
~/*</kbd>" and was hovering over the keyboard with threats along the
lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/1334862797822373889">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1334796914831855617">Sara Soueidan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brucel/status/1334818455275626499">Bruce Lawson</a>, and more (principal) web developers seem to agree that CSS is hard to master. It’s interesting how experts say CSS is hard, while a group of people who specialise in other technology say otherwise.</p>
<p>I feel we, the community, have to acknowledge that CSS is easy to get started with and hard to master. Let’s reflect on the language and find out what makes it hard.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-and-common-properties"><a href="#syntax-and-common-properties">#</a> Syntax And Common Properties</h2>
<p>Back in 2013, Hugo “Kitty” Giraudel published <a href="https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/15/css-is-easy/">CSS is Easy</a>, in which they also write about how CSS is perceived as easy. In the article, Kitty makes an excellent point: “CSS is easy… syntactically.” I wholeheartedly agree. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> {
  <span>background-color</span>: black;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>body</span> {
    <span>background-color</span>: white;
    <span>color</span>: black;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this snippet, you can see much of the syntax used in CSS. There are selectors, declarations, I even added an at-rule (<code>@media</code>). The properties and values in this example are straight-forward; they just work. The at-rule, although syntactically simple, adds some cognitive load to understanding this snippet. It creates a relationship between what’s inside and outside the at-rule. In other words, to determine what colour the <code>body</code> is, we have to parse the entire file mentally.</p>
<p>This snippet isn’t too complex, but as we get more code the number of relationships (like the at-rule) do too.</p>
<h2 id="a-web-of-relationships"><a href="#a-web-of-relationships">#</a> A Web Of Relationships</h2>
<p>Syntax and basic properties are pretty easy, indeed. However, the learning curve of CSS quickly gets steeper when you start dealing with various relationships. Let’s look at some.</p>
<h3 id="property-sets"><a href="#property-sets">#</a> Property Sets</h3>
<p>Many properties are part of a set, meaning you may need several others to make one work. For instance, the <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and the <code>z-index</code> properties are ignored until you add the <code>position</code> property and set it to anything but <code>static</code>. That means that you have to learn a couple of properties of a set and how they relate to each other before being able to use one. If you’re unaware which properties rely on others, it can be extremely frustrating because it may appear that a declaration just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s not always obvious which pieces of the set are declared. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>.snackbar</span> {
  <span>position</span>: fixed;
  <span>bottom</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>left</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
  <span>right</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
}

<span>@media</span> (<span>min-width:</span> <span>64em</span>) {
  <span>.snackbar</span> {
    <span>bottom</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>left</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
    <span>right</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the first rule, we can easily tell how an element with the <code>snackbar</code> class would be positioned on our page. If we look at the second rule, the one in the <code>@media</code> at-rule, we’re not so sure. We’d have to look up the <code>.snackbar</code> rule outside the at-rule. This example is fairly obvious, but it can get pretty obscure. The <code>position: fixed</code> declaration could be set elsewhere, on another selector, or inline.</p>
<h3 id="the-dom"><a href="#the-dom">#</a> The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h3>
<p>We can’t determine which styles are applied just by looking at your CSS. The HTML, or rather the DOM, also affects them. We have to consider the tag name of the element, its attributes, its siblings, its parents all the way up to the root node, and all relevant styles. If you render HTML server- or client-side, all of this may be dynamic and influenced by the application state.</p>
<p>The adjacent sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) is a simple example of how HTML influences CSS. The following style is only applied when a <code>li</code> is followed by another:</p>
<pre><code><span>li</span> + <span>li</span> { <span>margin-top</span>: <span>1rem</span>; }
</code></pre>
<p>This example is quite expressive but doesn’t have to be. Another example that took me a while to get as a beginner was using <code>position: absolute</code> on an element with a parent with <code>position: relative</code>. The element with <code>position: absolute</code> is positioned relative to the viewport or relative to an ancestor element with <code>position: relative</code>. In order to place this <code>absolute</code> element correctly in the interface, we have to know whether the element sits in a container with <code>position: relative</code>. Again, we’d have to look at the DOM, and at all it’s states, to be sure this is the case.</p>
<p>A similar, perhaps more familiar, example is the <code>flex</code> property. It only works if the element is a direct child of an element with the <code>display: flex</code> declaration.</p>
<p>When we write CSS, we always have to consider the DOM.</p>
<h3 id="cascade"><a href="#cascade">#</a> Cascade</h3>
<p>Let’s say I want text and links in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to be red. We might write the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code><span>nav</span> { <span>color</span>: red; }
<span>nav</span> <span>a</span> { <span>color</span>: inherit; }
</code></pre>
<p>These two simple declarations imply various relationships. The link colour is now dependent on the colour of the text. Because of that, we can set the text colour of the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element and the link will inherit this colour. If we remove either of these two declarations, the link colour won’t be red anymore.</p>
<p>The flexibility cascade gives has its benefits, but it’s not hard to imagine that it can get difficult to track the relationships between all styles. It’s no surprise that many opt to use cascade as little as possible.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility"><a href="#compatibility">#</a> Compatibility</h2>
<p>Designing an interface with CSS that doesn’t break is no easy task. There are numerous devices, browsers, resolutions, and users we have to take into account. We can also account for device settings, like dark mode using <code>prefers-color-scheme: dark/light</code>. On top of that, there are often various conditions in the interface that affect the styling as well.</p>
<p>Every combination of all these states and overrides have to be taken into account to produce the right output style. Again, this is no easy feat. It often involves a lot of tools and testing during and after development.</p>
<h2 id="maintainability"><a href="#maintainability">#</a> Maintainability</h2>
<p>Like all other code, CSS should be clean, readable, and maintainable. We can group styles into various files, or prefix selectors, but all rules live globally. This is a challenge, but also greatly contributes to keeping the code <abbr title="Don’t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>.</p>
<p>I earlier explained various types of relationships in CSS. They play a part in maintainability as well. Some of the methodologies used in CSS — like atomic design, <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr>, <abbr title="Inverted Triangle CSS">ITCSS</abbr>, and others — help to keep the coupling in check. They’re similar to paradigms and best practises in programming, and also steepen the learning curve and requires additional knowledge.</p>
<p>Then there are also preprocessors. We have a lot of them (e.g. PostCSS, Sass, LESS, and Stylus) at our disposal to do things we can’t do with vanilla CSS. This usually improves maintainability but does add another layer of complexity.</p>
<p>Finally, not unlike other languages, there often are various solutions to one problem. A common example is deciding between <code>display: inline-block</code>, the <code>float</code> property, flexbox, or grid to horizontally stack a list of items. Each has its pros and cons. When mentoring beginners, I found this is a challenge for them. It’s also difficult to convey the differences of these options — that are often subtle — and which is the most robust in a given situation.</p>
<p>All together, maintainability in CSS is a tradeoff. The code gets more complex syntactically and bound by self-imposed rules, but (hopefully) reduces the effort it takes to understand and modify the code.</p>
<h2 id="concluding"><a href="#concluding">#</a> Concluding</h2>
<p>CSS may seem simple at first, but the learning curve isn’t linear; mastering it is hard. By no means is the language perfect, but it’s amazingly efficient at what it’s designed to do. Despite its simple syntax, there’s little it can’t do.</p>
<p>I think mastering CSS comes down to having a good amount of knowledge about it, recognising the subtle dependencies between different declarations, rules, and the DOM, understanding how they make your CSS complex, and how to best avoid them. Reaching that point is naturally frustrating because you will run into code that is a tangled mess where the tiniest edit might change the interface in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>I worry that the way we think about CSS might affect how beginners perceive the language. If they are taught that CSS is easy, they might be discouraged from seeking help when they struggle or just blame the language. Admitting you struggle with something is difficult enough. Let’s not make it worse for them.</p>
<p>I feel it’s better if we acknowledge the complexity of writing CSS. We might also stop looking down on CSS specialists. Today, they’re often considered half a developer, whilst (JavaScript) software engineers (or UI engineers, or whatever they’re called nowadays) that know little about the complexities of CSS are considered full-fledged front-end developers. We see this on social media, in job openings, and in pay.</p>
<p>Thanks to Danielle, Hidde, Sven, and Thijs for reviewing this post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

<p>The Apple M1 available in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, and Mac Mini has
been the focus of a ton of benchmarking writeups and blog posts about
the new chip. The performance overall, and especially performance/watt,
that Apple has achieved with the chip is very impressive.
As a ray tracing person, what caught my eye the most was the
performance AnandTech reported in their
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/2">CineBench benchmarks</a>.
These scores were 1.6x higher than I got on my old Haswell desktop and 2x
higher than my new Tiger Lake laptop!
I had also been interested in trying out the new
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">ray tracing API for Metal</a>
that was announced at WWDC this year,
which bears some resemblance to the DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX GPU ray tracing APIs.
So, I decided to pick up a Mac Mini to do some testing
on my own interactive path tracing project,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a>,
and to get it running on the new Metal ray tracing API.
In this post, we’ll take a look at the new Metal ray tracing
API to see how it lines up with DirectX, Vulkan, OptiX and Embree,
then we’ll make some fair (and some extremely unfair) ray tracing
performance comparisons against the M1.</p>

<!--more-->



<p><a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT">ChameleonRT</a> is an open source
interactive path tracer that I’ve been working on to learn the different ray tracing APIs,
and to provide an example or starting point for myself and others working with them
in other projects.
ChameleonRT provides backends for the GPU ray tracing APIs:
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/dxr">DirectX Ray Tracing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/vulkan">Vulkan KHR Ray Tracing</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/optix">OptiX 7</a>.
Through the work discussed in this post, it also has a new
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/metal">Metal</a> GPU backend.
ChameleonRT also has an <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/tree/master/embree">Embree backend</a>
for fast multi-threaded and SIMD accelerated ray tracing on CPUs through
<a href="https://www.embree.org/">Embree</a>, <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB">TBB</a>.
The rendering code in each backend is nearly identical and they produce almost pixel exact outputs,
with some possible small differences due to subtle differences in the ray tracing
libraries or shader languages.</p>

<p>ChameleonRT is different from popular ray tracing benchmark applications like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinebench">CineBench</a>, <a href="http://www.luxmark.info/">LuxMark</a>,
and <a href="https://opendata.blender.org/">Blender Benchmark</a>, in that ChameleonRT is
a minimal interactive path tracer. CineBench, LuxMark, and Blender Benchmark are excellent
for getting a full picture of what performance to expect from a production film
renderer, as they are production renderers. However, there’s a lot more going
on in a production renderer than just ray tracing to support the kind of complex
geometries, materials, and effects used in film; and the large code
bases can be challenging to quickly port to a new architecture or API.
ChameleonRT is the exact opposite, supporting just one geometry type,
triangle meshes, and one material type, the Disney BRDF.
The rest of the code is similarly written to achieve interactive path tracing performance,
though I have tried to balance this with how complex the code is to read.
For example, the renderers use iterative ray tracing instead of recursion,
support only a simple sampling strategy, and don’t support alpha cut-out effects.
The use of iterative ray tracing is valuable on both the CPU and GPU, but is
especially important on the GPU, as the
overhead of recursive ray tracing calls in the pipeline can have a significant performance impact.
Similarly, ignoring alpha cut-out effects allows the GPU renderers
to skip using an any hit shader (and the Embree on to skip needing an intersection
filter). The any hit shader (or intersection filter) would be called during
BVH traversal after a candidate intersection with a triangle is found.
In the case that the BVH traversal is hardware accelerated, this ends up
producing a lot amount of back and
forth between the fixed function traversal hardware and the shader cores to run the any hit
shader during traversal, limiting the hardware’s performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s a path tracer? Path tracing is a technique in computer graphics for
rendering photo-realistic images by simulating the light transport in
the scene. It is a Monte Carlo technique, meaning that it randomly samples
light paths emitted from lights in the scene that reach the camera
by bouncing off objects in the scene. This is done by tracing the paths in reverse,
starting from the camera and tracing the path back through the scene.
A large number of light paths need to be sampled to produce a noise-free
image. Path tracing is not restricted to photo-realism, and is the
core rendering algorithm used in major film renderers, such as: Pixar’s Renderman,
Disney’s Hyperion, Autodesk’s Arnold, and Weta’s Manuka.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">Wikipedia</a> for more.</p>

<p>The new ray tracing API in Metal will be familiar to those who’ve used inline ray
tracing in DirectX or Vulkan. For a good introduction to Metal’s API, check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10012/">Discover ray tracing
with Metal</a> video from WWDC 2020,
and the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/accelerating_ray_tracing_using_metal?language=objc">accompanying sample</a>.
Inline ray tracing allows applications to make ray tracing calls in any shader stage,
e.g., fragment/pixel shaders, vertex shaders, compute shaders, etc.
Inline ray tracing allows ray tracing effects, for example accurate reflections and shadows,
to be integrated into the regular rasterization pipeline.
Inline ray tracing can also be used from a compute shader to implement a standalone
path tracing based renderer. ChameleonRT is a standalone path tracer, and takes
the compute shader approach for Metal.</p>

<p>At a high-level, ray tracing in Metal proceeds as follows: you upload your
geometry data, build bottom-level primitive acceleration structures over them, then create instances
referencing those acceleration structures and build a top-level acceleration structure over
the instances.
To render the scene you dispatch a compute shader and trace rays against the top-level
acceleration structure to get back intersection results. The intersection results provide
you with the intersected primitive and geometry IDs, and if using instancing, the instance ID.
Your shader can then look up the geometry data for the object that was hit and shade it,
after which it can continue tracing the path.</p>

<p>At this time Metal only supports inline ray tracing, in contrast to DirectX and Vulkan, which
also provide support for ray tracing pipelines. Ray tracing pipelines are used
to implement standalone ray tracing renderers, and is the approach ChameleonRT
uses in its DirectX and Vulkan backends.
OptiX only supports ray tracing pipelines.
Ray tracing pipelines require the creation of a Shader Binding Table to
provide the API with a table of functions to call when specific objects
in the scene are intersected. The SBT can be difficult to setup and debug,
and is a common point of difficulty for developers learning these APIs.
For more information about the SBT, check out my post
<a href="https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways">“The RTX Shader Binding Table Three Ways”</a>.
However, the potential benefit of the SBT is that the GPU can reorder or group function
calls to reduce thread divergence. With inline ray tracing, the developer
must do this themselves, or do without
(check out another video from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10013/">WWDC20</a>
for information here).
Right now, ChameleonRT does not do any reordering to reduce divergence.</p>

<p>Those familiar with Metal may know of the previous
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/metal_for_accelerating_ray_tracing?language=objc">Metal Performance Shaders ray intersector</a>.
The new support for inline ray tracing improves on this by allowing the renderer
to move entirely to the GPU. The previous ray intersector worked by taking
batches of rays, finding intersections in the scene, and writing these results
back out to memory. Multiple compute shaders would need to be dispatched to
trace the primary rays and create shadow and secondary rays, then trace the shadow rays
and continue the secondary rays while filtering out paths that terminated.
This requires significantly more memory traffic and compute dispatches, introducing overhead
to the renderer. Such an approach is also not well suited to augmenting traditional
rasterization pipelines with ray tracing effects.
Approaches based on tracing and sorting rays and intersection information to extract
coherence are valuable for complex film renderers, and can be implemented efficiently using inline
ray tracing as well.
For example, <a href="https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/hyperiondesign.html">Disney’s Hyperion renderer</a>
uses sorting and batching extensively to
extract coherent workloads from an otherwise incoherent and divergent distribution of rays.
There’s also an excellent higher-level <a href="https://youtu.be/frLwRLS_ZR0">video</a> explaining how this
works.</p>

<p>The Metal ray tracing API is quite nice to work with.
It bears a lot of similarity to the other ray tracing APIs, but has been streamlined
to be easier to use.
For example, compare the code required to build and compact a BVH in
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/dxr/dxr_utils.cpp#L877-L977">DirectX</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/vulkan/vulkanrt_utils.cpp#L46-L214">Vulkan</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/metal/metalrt_utils.mm#L318-L396">Metal</a>.
OptiX’s API provides a similar simplification, here’s the
<a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/ChameleonRT/blob/master/optix/optix_utils.cpp#L183-L244">BVH build in OptiX</a>
for reference.
It’s also nice to have templates and C++ style functionality in the shader language,
a feature Metal shares with OptiX, which uses CUDA for the device side code.</p>

<p>This simplicity also has some drawbacks. For example, while in DirectX, Vulkan, and OptiX
you have control over where the acceleration structure memory is allocated,
Metal makes this allocation for you. As a result, you cannot allocate the acceleration
structures on a <code>MTLHeap</code>, and so to make sure they’re available for your rendering
pipeline, you must individually mark them as used in a loop instead of a single <code>useHeap</code> call.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span></span><span>// Use our top level acceleration structure</span>
<span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>setAccelerationStructure</span><span>:</span><span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>atBufferIndex</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>// Also mark all mesh acceleration structures used, as they're indirectly</span>
<span>// referenced by the top level one</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mesh</span> <span>:</span> <span>bvh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>meshes</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>command_encoder</span> <span>useResource</span><span>:</span><span>mesh</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bvh</span> <span>usage</span><span>:</span><span>MTLResourceUsageRead</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This can add some overhead if you have a lot of bottom level BVHs, as can be the
case in scenes with many instances.
It’d be nice to be able to allocate the acceleration structures on a heap, and replace this loop
with a single <code>[command_encoder useHeap:data_heap-&gt;heap];</code></p>

<p>The API is also simplified significantly by not including ray tracing pipelines and
only requiring a Shader Binding Table-esque
structure when implementing custom geometries or other operations that need
to happen …</p></div></div></div>

For a local installation, supply instead of "pil" the actual path like "./pil"
or "../pil21/pil".

The pieces are indicated by the letters 'K'ing, 'Q'ueen, 'R'ook, 'B'ishop,
k'N'ight and 'P'awn, with black pieces in angular brackets.

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>
