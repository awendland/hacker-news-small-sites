		</div><p>It's Sweden's storied worker protections and climate-conscious citizens welcoming Amazon's ruthless drive for low prices. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Stockholm is preparing for a tug-of-war with one of the world’s most powerful companies — which just announced its entry into the Swedish market — and hopes that its arrival will mean the country of 10 million will be able to change Amazon, instead of being changed by it.</p>
<p>Amazon's plans — dubbed “<a href="https://www.ehandel.se/har-ar-amazon-se-det-blir-en-helsvensk-lansering" target="_blank">Project Dancing Queen</a>,” after the hit song by Swedish pop group Abba — don't have a lot of detail, but analysts believe its Swedish store will go live in the fall, in time for November’s Black Friday online shopping bonanza.</p>
<p>“Amazon has been supporting Swedish customers and selling partners across our different European stores for many years, but the next step is to bring a full retail offering to Sweden and we are making those plans now,” said Alex Ootes, Amazon’s vice president for EU expansion, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s turbo-capitalism corporate culture goes against the grain of Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries, which pride themselves in their strong labor unions and sustainability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls” <em>— Jonas Arnberg, CEO of market-research firm HUI</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But the country also has an affluent, internet-savvy market ripe for Alexa, Kindles, Prime and the thousands of items on Amazon's online store, the company believes. Around 68 percent of Swedes shopped online in 2018, and they spent an average of €200 per online transaction. In total, the Nordic countries spent over €22 billion online in 2018, according to a <a href="https://www.postnord.fi/siteassets/raportit/verkkokauppa-pohjoismaissa/ecommerce-in-the-nordics-2019.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by PostNord, the country’s postal service.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of competition in online marketplaces, and nobody can match Amazon’s massive cornucopia of goods.</p>
<p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls,” said Jonas Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, a market research company.</p>
<p>Amazon will change that, and force local players to adopt e-commerce faster than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm in e-commerce now. The COVID-19 impact took us two to three years forward in digitalization. With Amazon’s entry it is going to go even further,” said Kristoffer Väliharju, the CEO of CDON, a Nordic online marketplace. Väliharju is optimistic about CDON’s chances of taking on the tech giant, but said companies without a strong e-commerce game will likely take a big hit.</p>
<p>Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.</p>
<p>Analysts believe local warehouses are inevitable if Amazon is to offer one of its most unique selling points: quick delivery.</p>
<h3>When in Stockholm</h3>
<p>Establishing a local operation will be a major challenge for the company. American Amazon’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/how-amazon-is-fighting-back-against-workers-efforts-to-unionize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-union stance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working culture</a> is the antithesis of pro-union Sweden. (Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's political career is rooted in union activism dating from his time as a welder.)</p>
<p>The Swedish labor market is regulated by collective agreements between companies and unions, giving workers plenty of power over corporate decisions. Approximately 70 percent of Swedish workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>“If Amazon wants to succeed in Sweden, they need to work very closely with unions,” said Arne Andersson, an e-commerce expert at PostNord.</p>
<p>Amazon has not yet contacted Handels, the union representing warehouse workers, its political coordinator Emelie Wärn told POLITICO.</p>

<p>“Amazon is welcome to Sweden, but they have to sign a collective agreement. We will work very hard to get them to do that,” Wärn said.</p>
<p>“The fact that international companies takes interest in the Swedish market place is a positive thing. As an employer in Sweden you are obliged to follow Swedish labor legislation, which includes regulations regarding collective bargaining,” said Eva Nordmark, Sweden’s minister of employment, adding that approximately 90 percent of the employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for a card-carrying Swedish warehouse worker is 142.50 Swedish krona (€13.85) per hour before tax, according to Handels. In contrast, Amazon’s Polish warehouse workers who serve the German market <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-amazon-employees-rage/">earn</a> 20 zlotys (around €4.50). Amazon said its workers in Germany earn a base pay of €11.10 an hour.</p>
<p>But the union is confident it will be able to negotiate with the tech goliath. Handels has done similar deals with Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo, Wärn said as an example.</p>
<p>But Uniqlo is not Amazon, and Handels' confidence might be misplaced, according to Markus Varsikko, a retail consultant at Dash Retail, which helps businesses use Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>“Amazon is a realist. If they can operate in Germany, they can operate in Sweden. It is an American company with American culture and thinking, and it is far from what we are used to here,” Varsikko said, arguing that Sweden's companies and workers might have to adapt — not the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Handels and Greta</h3>
<p>Amazon might also have to polish its sustainability credentials to appease Swedish consumers.</p>
<p>“What makes the Swedish market unique is that there is a great focus on companies to do good, be transparent and sustainable. For many Swedes, this is even more important than a wide range and low price,” said Niclas Eriksson, the CEO of electronics retailer Elgiganten. And thanks to local activist Greta Thunberg, consumers are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cancel-your-amazon-prime-subscription-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming increasingly aware</a> of the carbon footprint of services like next-day delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>European consumer groups have slammed Amazon for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus Amazon's insistence on lower prices might not be its winning ticket.</p>
<p>The foray into the Swedish market by another e-commerce company, Wish, may serve as a cautionary tale. The American online marketplace, which mostly sells cheap items from China, tried and failed to take over the market a few years ago. The company first wooed consumers with dirt-cheap products such as electronics and clothes, only for Swedes to be disappointed by the quality of the products and frustrated by not being able to return products to sellers.</p>
<p>"[Wish] was cheap, it was a great marketplace, but it was also crap,” said PostNord’s Andersson. Wish did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon's had troubles with quality control too. European consumer groups have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/online-marketplaces-rife-with-unsafe-and-illegal-items-study-shows/">slammed</a> the company for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform. The European Commission also put pressure on online platforms to control scammers and price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>CDON’s Väliharju said Swedish customers are very quality-conscious, and aware of their rights as consumers. Consumer groups and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-big-brands-chanel-canon-louis-vuitton-nike-are-taking-on-big-tech-silicon-valley-at-last/">brands</a> have criticized Amazon and others for not holding sufficient information about their sellers, especially for products that come from outside the European Union that could be dangerous or counterfeit.</p>
<p>“Amazon absolutely could be well met by Swedish consumers in the beginning,” said Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, citing Amazon’s promise of low prices, a big range of products and fast delivery.</p>
<p>“But in the long run they will have to adjust to Sweden."</p>

I started noticing the performance bottlenecks started when I tried to run Wordpress on it, where a single page load of a newly installed Wordpress blog takes about <strong>10 seconds!</strong> Nevertheless, all that was unsurprising given the measly single-core 700MHz processor on each node.</p><p>At that point in time, I've graduated from university then and secured a job as a Data Scientist + Full-Stack Engineer at a startup and I thought to myself:</p><blockquote>What better a time to build myself a new cluster?</blockquote><h2 id="kraken">Kraken</h2><p>The second cluster was named <em>Kraken</em>.</p><blockquote>The <strong>kraken</strong> (/ˈkrɑːkən/)[1] is a legendary cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size in Scandinavian folklore. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>The Kraken is basically a much bigger and monstrous octopus, hence the name, symbolizing an evolution of the first cluster. It was built out of 7 Raspberry Pi 3Bs powered by a single USB charger. </p><p>With my first pay check, I had initially intended to <em>finally</em> build a cluster of 8 nodes but once again I was unable to realize this <em>cursed</em> idea. The maximum number of ports on a consumer-grade network switch was 8, enough for 7 nodes and a cable to the router. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<p>The Aviation Platform crew (for an explanation of crews and wings,<a href="https://flightaware.engineering/crews-wings-and-alliances-part-1-the-principles-of-how-we-work/" target="_see this blog post"> see this blog post</a>) revolves around the performance and reliability of Hyperfeed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Hyperfeed is FlightAware’s core flight tracking engine. Its output powers the company’s most salient offerings: the <a href="https://flightaware.com/live/flight/ABW140" target="_blank"> flight pages</a> on the website, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/firehose/" target="_blank">Firehose</a>, <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/flightxml/">FlightXML</a>, and <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/premium/">flight alerts</a>. So if Hyperfeed stops working, so does much of FlightAware. Given the impact of a Hyperfeed outage, we need to know immediately if something goes—or might go—wrong so that we can act swiftly and precisely to remedy the situation. For maintaining the requisite accuracy and timeliness of Hyperfeed’s output, we rely heavily on monitoring<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. To that end, we have recently begun adopting Prometheus, a time-series metrics database, and Grafana, a powerful visualization platform. The introduction of these tools marks a significant upgrade and improvement to Hyperfeed’s current monitoring stack. It is hoped that by sharing our experience and the reasons for adoption that we can help inform the decision-making of others in an analogous situation.</p>
<p>Before discussing Prometheus and the many enhancements it brings to our monitoring of Hyperfeed, it helps to provide some context by examining what we currently use and how it has evolved over time. In its current form, Hyperfeed is a distributed system composed of a constellation of more than a dozen components and sub-systems spread across multiple machines for performance and fault-tolerance. Its sub-systems include a number of other well-known services: Postgres, Zookeeper, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. It wasn’t always like this, though. When I started working on Hyperfeed in 2016, it was not distributed; its components all ran on a single machine (this is not strictly true as it also used a Postgres database running on a separate server). Naturally, monitoring at that time was relatively less complex: it had markedly less surface area to cover. We were able to do the job effectively with a combination of custom, in-house tools and a heavy dose of Zabbix.</p>
<p>Our custom monitoring tools mostly consisted of some scripts that followed Hyperfeed’s output and its logging statements looking for problems, e.g., the output has stopped completely, the output is out of date, or an excess number of tracebacks happened. These tools were specific to Hyperfeed and did not generalize well to other software. Zabbix, on the other hand, has been FlightAware’s primary monitoring and alerting framework. It is used throughout the company and not specific to any piece of software. When applied to Hyperfeed, Zabbix monitored some key characteristics of the server running the application such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Moreover, the aforementioned custom tools fed their data into Zabbix so that they could be used for alerting an engineer if something went haywire. On top of that, Zabbix gave us a basic web interface for viewing the data it collected in a graphical format. Back when Hyperfeed fit snugly on a single server, this sort of monitoring served us well: Zabbix was a one-stop shop for all things monitoring. But as the demands placed on Hyperfeed grew, so did its operational complexity.</p>
<p>Eventually, a single-machine architecture was not enough to handle the increased volume of Hyperfeed’s input, which was precipitated by FlightAware acquiring <a href="https://flightaware.com/commercial/aireon/" target="_blank">new data sources</a>, and expanding its <a href="https://flightaware.com/adsb/" target="_blank">existing data sources</a>. In order to accommodate this change in scale, it was necessary to distribute Hyperfeed across multiple machines. When this happened, we continued using (and still do use) custom tools and Zabbix for monitoring. Our custom tools, though, and the data we send to Zabbix necessarily expanded, too. Although distributing Hyperfeed across multiple machines was necessary and improved the performance and reliability of the system, it also brought with it new challenges and difficulties, particularly in terms of monitoring<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Given their origin, our custom tools were not designed with a distributed setting in mind. As such, they lacked the ability to easily aggregate data across multiple machines and were somewhat cumbersome to operate as Hyperfeed’s architecture progressed. In addition, Zabbix started creaking and revealing some rough edges as we placed more demands on it. A core issue was that Zabbix does really well at monitoring particular machines but not as well at system or application level monitoring, especially in a context where services can move around from machine to machine as failures occur or as an intentional part of the design. In a distributed setting, it also imposes non-trivial operational burdens, e.g., when adding new monitoring points or spreading the collection load across machines. Moreover, Zabbix combines all monitoring functions into a single monolith rather than the current best practice of loosely coupling monitoring tasks like collecting data, long-term storage, querying data, alerting with deduplication and aggregation, and visualization/dashboarding (for further details on monitoring system best practices, see the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/monitoring/" target="_blank">Google SRE workbook’s monitoring chapter</a>).</p>
<p>As Hyperfeed moved to a distributed architecture, a change driven by business demands and an increased volume of flight tracking data, it became clear that our monitoring tools, while mostly satisfactory in alerting us when something failed in the system, neglected to provide us with many of the other benefits that monitoring can offer. In particular, we were weak in whitebox monitoring and visualization<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.Whitebox monitoring is especially important for analyzing long-term trends, comparing experimental groups, and in guiding capacity planning and other engineering decision making. Some information can only come from the vantage point provided by whitebox monitoring. For visualization we had Zabbix, but its capabilities there are fairly limited and inflexible. Given all of this, we started looking for a new solution to fill in the gaps in our monitoring approach, something designed for dynamic, distributed systems. We chose Prometheus and Grafana. This combo of tools addresses the shortcomings of our current approach, and also brings with it a number of additional virtues.</p>
<h2 id="upgradingmonitoringwithprometheusandgrafana">Upgrading Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</h2>
<h3 id="prometheustimeseriesmetrics">Prometheus: Time-Series Metrics</h3>
<p>In an idealized monitoring practice, every event or state of a system is recorded so that it is available if needed: no detail is left out. Unfortunately, this only works in a hypothetical, theoretical scenario since it is impossible to store, process, and work with the quantity of data generated continuously by modern systems. Instead of capturing everything, one must grapple with what to monitor: how to turn the endless torrent of events in a system into something comprehensible, manageable, and actionable. To this end, Prometheus provides time-series metrics, which track aggregations of events in a system over some period of time, where an event refers to anything that might occur and can be quantified or measured. Some example events include a function getting called, CPU usage going up, a web request being made, a client connecting to a service or a cache hit happens.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Fundamentally, the monitoring offered by Prometheus periodically takes a snapshot of some of the events in a system, typically measuring how often or how quickly each event occurred. The value of a snapshot at any given point is often of less interest than its relative value: how the frequency of an event changes over time provides the actionable insight and value of metrics-based monitoring. To make this more concrete, in the case of flight tracking some example time-series metrics of interest might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Departures per second</li>
<li>Arrivals per day</li>
<li>Cancellations per minute</li>
<li>Diversions per hour</li>
<li>Flight plans created per second</li>
<li>Input messages processed per second</li>
<li>Output messages generated per second</li>
<li>99th percentile of the time taken to process an ADS-B position over the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order to keep the amount of data captured manageable, the contents of the input messages that trigger each of these events get aggregated away. With metrics, the rate of departures, for example, are measured throughout the system, but any single departure cannot be investigated. As succinctly summarized by <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-101-collecting-data/" target="_blank">Datadog</a>, metrics provide “the big, broad-stroke measures that can help you quickly answer the most pressing questions about a system’s internal health and performance.“ Metrics can also capture resource utilization, like CPU, memory, or disk, and metadata like code revisions and configuration values. Time-series metrics, despite necessarily omitting a lot of detail, are still quite versatile, yielding practicable monitoring data for critical activities throughout a system.</p>
<h3 id="dataandoperationalmodel">Data and Operational Model</h3>
<p>One of Prometheus’ main selling points is that it provides a powerful and conceptually straightforward data model for extracting metrics from a system of interest and tracking their rate of change over time. Each time-series metric tracked by Prometheus includes the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric name: a string indicating what the metric is for, e.g., <code>hyperfeed_departures_total</code>.</li>
<li>Help documentation: a string describing what the metric is for or where it comes from.</li>
<li>Metric type: four types are provided, but two of them provide the atomic building blocks of the others. The fundamental types are counters, which can only go up or reset, and gauges, which can be set to any value.</li>
<li>Labels: key-value pairs attaching additional dimensions to the metric. Labels …</li></ul></section></div></article></div></div>

<p>Sixty years ago this week — on August 12, 1960 — Dr. Seuss published what would become his biggest-selling book of all time. Written as the result of a $50 bet between Seuss and his friend and publisher at Random House, Bennett Cerf, the book, by some estimates, has sold north of 200 million copies.*</p>



<p>The book? <em>Green Eggs and Ham.</em></p>



<p>When I discuss <em>Becoming Dr. Seuss </em>with audiences, Seuss fans tell me they have warm memories of this one; it’s the book that taught them how to read, or it’s the first book they received as a gift — or, as grown-ups, it’s a book they can still quote and recite word-for-word. And it <em>is </em>a great book–but it’s an important one, too, both in the Seuss library and in the overall oeuvre of children’s literature. There’s a lot going on between its colorful orange boards, the result of sweat, inspiration, and no small amount of luck. But to truly appreciate how smart, and how important <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> is, we need to go back a few years before its 1960 publication to get some background and some context. </p>

<p>Let’s start, then, by checking in with this May 1954 issue of LIFE magazine (that’s comedic actress Kaye Ballard on the cover, by the way, who was burning up Broadway in the musical <em>The Golden Apple</em> and would later make an appearance on <em>The Muppet Show</em>) which features an article by Pulitzer Prize winning novelist John Hersey titled, “Why Do Students Bog Down on the First ‘R’?” The cover text teases the article as  “Why Can’t My Child Read?” but the gist is the same: namely, Hersey was discouraged by the low rates of childhood literacy in the United States, and placed the blame for children’s lack of interest in reading squarely on the shoulders of the ponderous <em>Dick and Jane </em>standard reading primers on which several generations of children had been raised. </p>

<p>The real problem, as Hersey saw it, was that Dick and Jane were<em> terrible</em>. The text — with its now-easily lampooned, “Look, Jane, look. See the ball?” syntax — was bad enough, but Hersey thought the artwork was even worse–“insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children,” he railed. No one, he concluded, was interested in reading about Dick and Jane and their lives of quiet desperation. At the very least, suggested Hersey, couldn’t they get Dr. Seuss to illustrate the otherwise turgid text?</p>



<p>They never would get Dr. Seuss to illustrate Dick and Jane; instead, Seuss was approached by William Spaulding, an editor of children’s books at Random House rival Houghton Mifflin, who had read Hersey’s article and begged Dr. Seuss to “write me a story that first graders can’t put down.”</p>



<p>But there was a catch. Putting aside all their other problems, Dick and Jane were at least living their dull lives inside an actual reading primer, operating under a strict educator-approved vocabulary list of about 300 unique words at the first grade reading level. For his book, then, Dr. Seuss would have to play by those same rules, using only the words on the sanctioned reading list. Seuss told Spaulding he’d take the list home and “play with it.”</p>



<p>He played with it for nearly a year. It was, he said later, an “impossible and ridiculous task…I was forbidden to use any words beyond the list. I almost threw the job up.” Eventually, he decided to read through the list one last time, vowing that “if I find two words that rhyme and make sense to me, that’s the title.” Unfortunately,<em> tall </em>and <em>ball</em> were a bust.</p>

<p><em>Cat </em>and <em>hat</em>, however, were not.</p>



<p>After another year of work, Dr. Seuss published <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> in the Spring of 1957.** For <em>Cat</em>, Seuss had used 236 unique words from the word list. (His total word count, with repeated words, is about 1,600.) It was Seuss’ first real blockbuster of a book — the one that permitted him to finally devote himself full-time to writing and drawing books for children. But more importantly, <em>Cat in the Hat </em>is a bestseller with a pedagogy; with its reliance on the officially-sanctioned word list, it’s a book teachers approved of, one parents loved, and one kids actually wanted to read. In 1957, that was a game changer.</p>

<p>Inspired by the huge success of the Cat, Random House created a new imprint called Beginner Books, aimed squarely at beginning readers and which continued to lean on the educator-approved word list. Dr. Seuss was brought in as the imprint’s president and editor–a seat from which he would not only recruit and work with other writers and artists on children’s books (one of the most popular of which was P.D. Eastman’s <em>Go, Dog. Go!</em>) but would also regularly produce his own books under the new logo, featuring the Cat himself.</p>



<p>Among the first books Dr. Seuss produced for the Beginner Books imprint was <em>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</em>, completed in 1959. <em>One Fish</em> was an experiment for Seuss, as he was deliberately using an even more restrictive word list of short words, and placing the accompanying drawings as close to the text as he possibly could, like so:</p>

<p>It would be the prototype for a new line of books Seuss was already informally calling “Beginner Beginner Books,” aimed at very early readers with limited vocabularies. Soon, there would be a new imprint at Random House, overseen by Seuss, and formally designated with the moniker Bright &amp; Early Books. The Bright &amp; Early Books relied on an approved vocabulary list of only 182 simple words—a little more than half as large as the already restrictive list adhered to by Beginner Books.</p>

<p>Still with me? In 1959, Random House publisher Bennett Cerf approached Dr. Seuss and gleefully pointed out that the new Bright &amp; Early imprint relied on a tight list of 182 words. Then he laid down a playful and very specific challenge: <em>could Dr. Seuss write a book using only 50 of those words?</em> </p>



<p>Cerf bet Dr. Seuss $50 that he couldn’t. </p>



<p>Challenge accepted.</p>



<p>Seuss, who who had agonized and struggled with a broader and less restrictive word list as he worked on <em>The Cat in the Hat, </em>nevertheless rose to the occasion. But it’s probably no coincidence that the resulting book was all about convincing someone to do something they didn’t really want to do.</p>

<p><em>Green Eggs and Ham </em>would be its own kind of misery, requiring Seuss to create complicated charts, checklists, and multiple word counts as he struggled to keep track of the words he was using. He also imposed on himself a requirement to stick with one-syllable words, though he would make an exception for “anywhere,” which was made up of two short words that young readers would know.</p>



<p>Rhyming, too, could be tough with a fifty word restriction. “The agony is terrific at times, and the attribution is horrible,” he said. “If you’re doing it in quatrains and get to the end of four lines and can’t make it work, then it’s like unraveling a sock. You take some of your best stuff and throw it away.”</p>



<p>Dr. Seuss delivered <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> to Cerf at Random House in 1960. He was glad to be done with it, and somewhat nervous about how it would be received.</p>



<p>We all know how it turned out. “The good doctor has scored another triumph,” exclaimed the <em>New York Times</em>, while one reviewer wrote presciently of <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>: “A vocabulary of only fifty words, but they will long be remembered.”</p>

<p>For the rest of his life, Dr. Seuss would find himself at book signings and dinners in his honor where he would be served plates filled with green eggs and ham. “Deplorable stuff,” he said later, “The worst was on a yacht in six-foot seas.”</p>



<p>Generations of readers would look for hidden meanings and metaphors in its text—but for Dr. Seuss, <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> was only ever about one thing: “Cerf bet me fifty bucks I couldn’t write a book using only 50 words,” he said later. “I did it to show I could.”</p>



<p>Oh, and Seuss also said later that Bennett Cerf never paid him his fifty dollars. </p>



<p>Regardless, Happy 60th Birthday to <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>. Thank you, thank you, Sam I Am (and Dr. Seuss!)</p>

<p>* Publishers can be persnickety about releasing sales figures on the record. Total sales for <em>Green Eggs </em>are reported as anywhere from 8 million to 15 million to 200 million.</p>



<p>* * In a trade-off deal, Random House–Dr. Seuss’s normal publisher–permitted Houghton Mifflin to publish the textbook version of <em>Cat in the Hat </em>for schools, while Random House retained the trade rights. As it turned out, few schools bought the textbook version. Random House would make a mint off the Cat; Houghton — where the idea had originated in the first place! — not so much. Random House would eventually acquire the textbook rights back from its rival, and promptly shelve them, preferring to issue only the trade edition.</p>

Imagine if dinner was carted into this room, and four people got half the food. The night would end in violence," Anand Giridharadas told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed at a public event hosted by <a href="https://www.samaracanada.com/" target="_blank">the Samara Centre for Democracy</a>.</p>  <p>"But somehow you scale it up to the level of the society &nbsp;— millions and millions of people — and you make it money instead of food, and people are like,&nbsp;'Yeah I guess that's okay,'" Giridharadas added.</p>  <p>The journalist and author has been investigating how global elites in the U.S. have been "changing the world" and dominating the news with their efforts. In his book&nbsp;<em>Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World</em>, Giridharadas lays out how the the rich and powerful have been fighting for equality and injustice, branding themselves as socially engaged agents of change and pouring millions — if not trillions — of tax-avoided dollars into social causes.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But, he warns, in all of this good, their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve is obscured.</p>  <p>"If all these people on the top are doing all this nice stuff, but year by year they are increasing their concentration of wealth and power, their monopolies are getting more monopolistic, their tech companies are becoming more abusive of privacy and democracy —&nbsp;not less —&nbsp;if their influence over politics is increasing, not decreasing, then what is all this do-gooding doing?"&nbsp;</p>  <h2>'If only' solutions</h2>  <p>The New York University professor argues that the conventional wisdom out there to solve the world's problems stems from an "if only" approach, suggesting maybe there needs to be more than just one Mark Zuckerberg to fix this.</p>  <p>"If only we had an effective altruism movement, so that when you give money away you could be guided to give it more rationally. If you give it to this NGO, it will have more impact than if you give it to that one. If only Chinese billionaires could be persuaded to donate philanthropically at the same percentage that American billionaires do," he explained.</p>  <p>"If only, if only, if only."</p>  <p>This "if only" solution got Giridharadas thinking about an equal and opposite possibility.</p>  <p>"Maybe all this extraordinary elite helping in our time is how we maintain a system — an architecture of extraordinary elite hoarding," he told Ayed.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5180043.1580159463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/britain-facebook-privacy.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>'While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do ... is to start joining things.

Why should the decisions be left to permitting the rich to decide what's important — a hospital wing, a legal aid centre, a new well in the village? These are decisions that should involve everyone, including elected representatives and governments, Giridharadas argues.</p>  <p>When the rich and powerful not only get involved in change but get into the front row of social change, "they change 'change,'" said the former McKinsey analyst.</p>  <p>"They change what kinds of change are acceptable. They change the discourse we have about change."</p>  <h2>Make democracy</h2>  <p>If the institutions that are set up aren't to be trusted, Giridharadas proposes it's time to build better institutions — this time, from the bottom up.</p>  <p>He sees a possibility to make democracy better by organizing the world differently.</p>  <p>"While you don't have individually the power to dethrone a Mark Zuckerberg, what you do have the power to do — today, tomorrow and the next day — is to start joining things," he told Ayed.</p>  <p>Giridharadas calls on people to join organizations, membership lists and movements that work toward building cross-racial, cross-class coalitions of people — with a goal to create a future that benefits most people.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If we build movements to that effect, I think we can end this age of capital. I think we can usher in the age of reform and I think we can resume the idea of democracy as the place we go to change the world."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>* This episode was produced by Philip Coulter.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/3-classic-books-for-tech-leads-or-those-aspiring-to-be" data-title="3 Classic Books for Tech Leads (or those aspiring to be)"><p>Books are the best resource for sharing knowledge in a not-assisted way. They go deep into a topic, or more briefly over a bunch of them. Although, as a Software Engineer, I learned a lot from blog posts, tweets, and conference talks, it was books that prepared me for the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/tech-lead-everything-software-engineers-need-to-know-to-become-a-great-technology-leader">Tech Lead role</a>.</p>
<p>For this article, I created a list of 3 classic books I consider essential for whose transitioning — or desires to transition — to a leadership position in technology.</p>
<p>Books can teach us many things. It’s familiar to us to feel like there’re too many things to learn and too little time to absorb it. We tend to get anxious and overloaded with the content easily. Relax.</p>
<p>Take your time on reading, and take your time practicing it. Theory and practice converge at some point, and you realize you’ve been a leader for quite some time.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a while since their publication. So, you may notice some old stories during your reading. However, I think they are classic, and as any other book in this category, they aged very well.</p>

<p>Start receiving <strong>hand-picked content<br></strong><span>with high quality from <strong>experienced engineering leaders</strong> in your email regularly!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">Subscribe to our weekly Newsletter</a></p>

<p>That said, let’s go to the list.</p>
<h2>1. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</h2>
<p>The book was first published in 1987. The authors, Tom DeMarco and Timothy R. Lister talk about managing people through lots of stories. The stories may sound outdated and unlikely to happen nowadays, but their essence is still valid.</p>
<p>Many things stated by the two authors are kind of obvious, like<em> how expensive the turnover is, that we should include the team in the hiring process and that methodologies are restrictive</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic opportunity to recapitulate those topics; <strong>some were written more than 30 years ago</strong>.</p>
<p>Peopleware was the first book that I recall to mention the need for a sociological view, not only a technical one over projects and teams. As such, Tom and Timothy’s theories are still valid.</p>
<p>Among the theories, I how they state the importance of peer view (or <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">Code Review</a>, in our case), and that knowledge workers, like software engineers, are continuously working their soft and hard skills.</p>
<p>The theories go through the traps of <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/how-tech-leads-and-team-leads-can-measure-teams-productivity">software engineering productivity</a>, how office influences how we work, the impact of quality in our work, and much more.</p>
<h2>2. Driving technical change: Why People on Your Team Don’t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should</h2>
<p>If you’re new on persuasion and influence, the Driving Technical Change book is an excellent start. It’s full of anecdotes that surface how to gain skeptics buy-in for your ideas. It was published in 2010 and written by Terrence Ryan.</p>
<p>The content works pretty well for <em>an introductory approach on how to expose your ideas, find allies, and, most importantly, check whether your proposals are plausible</em>.</p>
<p>The book also lists some <strong>categories of skepticism, which was very valuable to me</strong>. I could better understand how the team responded to my inclinations and how I responded to others. This awareness is an excellent start for those wanting to manage large teams.</p>
<p>I confess the book is not very practical, and that may be a disadvantage against it. However, it was very relevant when I read it for the first time, and I strongly suggest you read this short (~200 pages) book even though it won’t answer all your questions or tell you exactly what to do.</p>
<h2>3. The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</h2>
<p>If you thought Peopleware was old because it was published in the late 80s, well, my next recommendation is 15 years earlier.</p>
<p>The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks was<strong> first published in 1975 (almost 50 years ago!)</strong> and covers <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/software-engineering-newsletter">software engineering and management topics</a>.</p>
<p>The author creates the concept of man-month. It’s the unit for the amount of work of a person in a month. Then, he defends that adding more people to a late project makes it later. It’s known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Brook’s law</a>.</p>
<p>It relates to the latest and hottest discussions in the agile world about “coordination costs”: <strong>when you increase the number of people in a group, organizing work gets harder</strong>. Thus, it requires more meetings and management efforts to align everybody, which delays the software development even more.</p>
<p>It’s an inspiring book, a classic one, which, in a certain way, is still modern and worth the reading.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After months of work, I am ecstatic to finally announce <strong>Bevy Engine</strong>!</p>
<p>Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine and app framework built in Rust. It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open-source</a> forever!</p>
<p>It has the following design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Capable</b>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set</li>
<li><b>Simple</b>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users</li>
<li><b>Data Focused</b>: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm </li>
<li><b>Modular</b>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like</li>
<li><b>Fast</b>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel</li>
<li><b>Productive</b>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bevy ECS</b>: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance</li>
<li><b>Render Graphs</b>: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes</li>
<li><b>Bevy UI</b>: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy</li>
<li><b>Productive Compile Times</b>: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the "fast compiles" config</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cross Platform</b>: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)</li>
<li><b>3D</b>: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading</li>
<li><b>Sprites</b>: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets</li>
<li><b>Assets</b>: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads</li>
<li><b>Scenes</b>: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds</li>
<li><b>Plugins</b>: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins</li>
<li><b>Sound</b>: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems</li>
<li><b>Multiple Render Backends</b>: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs">wgpu</a>)</li>
<li><b>Data Driven Shaders</b>: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms</li>
<li><b>Hot Asset Reloading</b>: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts</li>
<li><b>Events</b>: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems</li>
<li><b>Properties</b>: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names</li>
<li><b>Hierarchical Transforms</b>: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy </li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the "prototyping" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. <span>I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability</span>.</p>
<p>Hopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">The Bevy Book</a> is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note to the reader</strong>: in this article you will find text formatted like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_render/latest/bevy_render/texture/struct.Texture.html"><code>Texture</code>
</a></p>
<p>This formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!</p>
<h2 id="bevy-apps">Bevy Apps</h2>
<p>First, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_default_plugins</span><span>()
        .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc</p>
<p>You can also register the default <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> manually like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>CorePlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>InputPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>WindowPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>RenderPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        .</span><span>add_plugin</span><span>(</span><span>UiPlugin</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>())
        </span><span>/* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */
        </span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>And of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/trait.AddDefaultPlugins.html#method.add_default_plugins"><code>add_default_plugins()</code>
</a> for simplicity, at least initially. </p>
<h2 id="bevy-ecs">Bevy ECS</h2>
<p>All Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component, whereas another entity might have a <code>Position</code> and <code>UI</code> component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a <code>movement</code> system that runs on all entities with a <code>Position</code> and <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.</p>
<p>Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b>: normal Rust structs</li>
<li><b>Systems</b>: normal Rust functions</li>
<li><b>Entities</b>: a type containing a unique integer</li>
</ul>
<p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rW7ALyHaas">great introductions</a> to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave "getting up to speed on ECS" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:</p>
<h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>I'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS <em>in existence</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>struct </span><span>Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);
</span><span>struct </span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>f32</span><span>);

</span><span>// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components
</span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands</span><span>) {</span><span>
    commands
        </span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),))
        .</span><span>spawn</span><span>((</span><span>Position</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>),</span><span> Velocity</span><span>(</span><span>2.0</span><span>),));
}

</span><span>// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component
</span><span>fn </span><span>movement</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Mut</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Position</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>velocity</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>) {</span><span>

<p>That is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/blob/master/examples/basic.rs">won't</a> find <a href="https://github.com/TomGillen/legion">any</a> ECS <a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/blob/master/bunny_demo/src/systems.rs">with</a> better <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube">clarity</a> or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write <em>and</em> easy to read.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>One of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic <em>super</em> fast, primarily for these two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Iteration Speed</b>: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast</li>
<li><b>Parallelism</b>: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling</li>
</ol>
<p>Bevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular <code>ecs_bench</code> benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:</p>
<h4 id="system-iteration-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">System Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_iter.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<h4 id="world-setup-in-nanoseconds-less-is-better">World Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)</h4>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/ecs_build.svg" alt="ecs iter performance graph"></p>
<p>Note that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that <code>ecs_bench</code> is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. </p>
<p>I have pushed my version of <code>ecs_bench</code> <a href="https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench">here</a> if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>Now you might be thinking "Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but <em>surely</em> this means you had to compromise on features!"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>You may have heard of the “bus factor.” The strategy and processes designed to cover for the sudden loss of a teammate. The story goes: you want more than one person in your business to have domain knowledge because they might get hit by a bus! Your business would lose all that experience and expertise in one tragic accident. The premise in isolation sounds ridiculous, but mitigating the “bus factor” is serious business.</p><p>Everything gets a lot easier if you select the right software and framework, primarily if you use Ruby on Rails. Rails itself is a full-stack framework that has a best practice for every piece of a web application. If you are committed to doing things “the Rails way,” you cut the total cost of ownership by A LOT. “Staying on the Rails” makes any new developer productive almost immediately (and will keep them “out of the weeds”). Sticking to the standards evangelized by the community and adding proper documentation (possibly in the form of useful tests) makes onboarding a breeze, which creates more productive developers, which makes hiring more accessible, which reduces your “bus factor.” <br></p><p>The only guaranteed way to save money is to spend it on reducing your “bus factor”. By investing in making the code of your application more straightforward and easier to understand, you make it easier to add developers and reduce the future occurrence of bugs. You’ll make working on your code more enjoyable (reducing the likelihood your developers will want to leave), and possibly most importantly: reduce the barriers (time/money) to building new features. If you haven’t been keeping an eye on this, and find yourself in a position to hire someone, then these tasks will be their first job <strong>every time you hire</strong>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, I have no personal experience with a colleague getting hit by a bus, but I know a few that have been hired by Netflix. Remember to look both ways before crossing a street and never underestimate the amount of money the FAANGs have to poach your talent. It is effortless to lose good talent. When (not if) your developer leaves to make $500k+ a year in the valley, you’ll be in a much better position with a lower bus factor to quickly fill the gap and keep moving forward.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<p><span>Last week on July 29, 2020, the CEOs of the most powerful tech companies in the world—including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple—were called in to testify in front of the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The event was widely considered to be mostly political theater, a performance act for Congress to look like they’re hard on Big Tech. But the tech titans took it seriously, knowing the one thing that actually determines whether antitrust legislation moves forward: how each company fares in the court of public opinion. The company taking the most heat from both Democrats and Republicans was, without a doubt, Google. They’re also the company that’s most likely to be regulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The antitrust case against Google is the most straightforward of any of the big tech companies. Google started out as an almost benevolent index of the world wide web, showing users ten blue, unbiased links for whatever users were searching for. But over the years, Google has steadily favored showing their own products above organic search results, even when their own products arguably aren’t as good. Rand Fishkin </span><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-in-2020-from-everyones-search-engine-to-everyones-competitor/"><span>says that</span></a><span> in 2020, Google has gone “from everyone’s search engine to everyone’s competitor.”</span></p>
<p><span>As the founder of an SEO company, </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, and as someone who’s been working in growth and digital marketing for more than a decade, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch Google devour screen real estate to feature its own products. From my point of view, Google is squeezing businesses more than ever and the game is increasingly rigged in Google’s favor. Small and local businesses have almost no chance at succeeding with SEO because they don’t have the budget or resources for it. To make things worse, so much screen real estate is now taken up by Google’s own products, small businesses have no choice but to pay Google for search traffic. Even if users are searching directly for a business’s name, Google controls the appearance and experience of interacting with that business.</span></p>
<p><span>Local restaurants, for example, are forced to use Google’s partner ChowNow in order to have convenient “Order Pickup” or “Order Delivery” buttons in search results for their own name, which charges an added hefty fee to the restaurant for each order, hurting their already thin margins. During the global pandemic, this is an incredibly predatory shakedown. No small business should be forced to use Google’s preferred ordering mechanism, and pay a tax to Google, simply to allow a customer to search for their business. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-582x1024.png" alt="google chownow local businesses" width="582" height="1024" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-582x1024.png 582w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-171x300.png 171w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-768x1351.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745-600x1055.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7745.png 821w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote a great post summarizing the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">antitrust issues each tech behemoth has</a>, yet highlights his issues with Google’s position: “Google’s anticompetitive behavior is relatively clear…the company consistently favors its own properties in search results, particularly ‘above-the-fold’…that is, results that are not actually search results but which seek to answer the user’s query directly.” A few examples:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png" alt="ben thompson stratechery google antitrust regulation issues" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM.png 419w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-11-at-10.23.49-AM-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px"></p>
<p><span>Take a look below at how Google-owned YouTube results take up the vast majority of the screen on a simple video search. Other competing video products like Vimeo or Twitch don’t get the same visual treatment or preference in search results. You can barely see the first organic search result for this query:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png" alt="google YouTube video search results" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-929x1024.png 929w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-272x300.png 272w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-768x847.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM-600x662.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-05-at-9.53.37-AM.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px"></p>

<p><span>The problem gets even worse when we’re talking about more lucrative search categories, like flight search or finding a hotel. On the flight search example below (which also includes a Covid-19 travel warning), Google Ads and Google’s own Flights product take up the entire screen, any organic search results pushed below the fold. When searching for “hotels near cape may, nj” the actual organic search results were almost two pages below the fold. How many users do you think scroll that far, instead of clicking on Google’s products?</span></p>

<p><span>Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other companies have been complaining about unfair treatment by Google </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/technology/yelp-google-european-union-antitrust.html"><span>for years</span></a><span>, but left unfettered, Google is only going to continue to expand their own products into more search categories over time. The list of companies with grievances against Google is growing. The landscape for businesses to compete in search is increasingly competitive, and the companies who succeed in search over the long-run are using advanced tactics like SEO A/B testing and NLP content optimization, which the average business can’t afford.</span></p>
<p><span>On a recent episode of the </span><a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co/"><span>All-In Podcast</span></a><span>, Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, and esteemed guests engage in a rigorous and detailed debate about Big Tech antitrust and censorship (I recommend </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Ewtt593ZsFT5QXJSB97wR?si=Ej5Bx4UMRwqrU4ruSog06w"><span>giving it a listen</span></a><span> if you haven’t, as it covers the strongest arguments both for and against Big Tech regulation). Chamath says what I think most people don’t want to admit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>The internet is now a pervasive and critical part of human infrastructure. As such, there needs to be people that regulate and manage the internet</b><span>—the same way that the FAA manages and regulates planes, and wind turbines, etc.… Let’s take aviation [for example], it’s impossible for you to go into your garage and build a plane that takes people from point A to point B. Take agriculture [for example], it’s impossible for you to build up a farm and supply it to Safeway, without any checks and balances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are very specific kinds of businesses and business models that should be overseen. The first and most important thing is a body [that] oversees the collection of user data and privacy and identification. The second one is essentially something that tears the fig leaf off of internet companies and says, you know what, you are the equivalent of a publisher and a platform, some weird hybrid that we didn’t think could exist when we wrote these rules, so we’re now going to adapt these rules. If you think about it, nobody is happy with the internet publishers today. The left thinks that it skews right, the right thinks it skews left—everybody is confused. Nobody gets what they want and somebody has to step in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You go to a movie and it tells you who can go to the movie or not. You buy an album and it tells you whether there’s explicit lyrics or not. Before you turn on the TV, there’s some rating agency that tells you whether your kid should be watching with you. My point is: what is the equivalent version here? We all need to think about what it is, but for there to be nothing is crazy.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Google search is fundamentally the gateway to the internet for the majority of people and an arbiter of truth in our digital age. Google has a </span><a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"><span>dominant market monopoly position</span></a><span>, a treasure trove of sensitive information on hundreds of millions of users. It’s incentivized to return value to shareholders and extract more value from search over time, which is at odds with doing right by businesses and citizens. Their business model doesn’t require them to act in the long-term interest of businesses and citizens, and because they have a monopoly on a utility that’s become essential to our day-to-day lives, the only solution is for the government to enforce guidelines on fair behavior within search.</span></p>

<p>Dramatic title, I know, but lately I've had a few people ask me what extensions I use, and through sharing my list I've learnt of even better ones, so what better way to amplify these positive effects than to leverage the internet? 😛</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump into it.</p><h3 id="privacy-badger-ublock-origin"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp">Privacy Badger</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">UBlock Origin</a></h3><p>Let's block all the ads! Sites look cleaner, load waayy faster, and pry less. These are the first extensions I install on <em>any</em> browser. </p><h3 id="nano-defender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a></h3><p>Let's block all the anti-adblockers! Many sites these days will try to get you to turn off your adblocker, but once you set up <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en">Nano Defender</a>, you'll no longer have to deal with that. Note: To use alongside Ublock Origin, I had to go through a <a href="https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin">few extra steps</a> first.</p><h3 id="hover-unpaywall-bypass-paywalls"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok/related">Hover</a> + <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>/ ByPass Paywalls</h3><p>Let's block all the login/paywalls! Are you starting to see a pattern here? 😛 The web can be full of thrash sometimes. With <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok">Hover</a> &amp; <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en">Unpaywall</a>, I can say goodbye to Medium and journal paywalls. If you're a fan of open source and have an extra minute to spend, check out this <a href="https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome">extension</a> instead.</p><h3 id="shut-up"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a></h3><p>Sometimes when I'm consuming content, I'll be tempted to see what others are saying about it. That's... not always good. Let these xkcd comics illustrate my point:</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/youtube.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png" alt="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/listen_to_yourself.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.maskys.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png"></figure><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en">Shut Up</a> disables comments everywhere. When I trust a platform's audience enough to read the unfiltered outputs from their brains, I enable comments for just that site. Sometimes I turn it back off immediately 💀</p><h3 id="reader-mode"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a></h3><p>Occasionally, even after all these purges, the content on a site will still be ridiculously hard to read- sometimes because they used a funky font and set the size to 8px, or sometimes because there are a million other article suggestions, plus three sidebars, plus an obnoxious navigation header that never goes away. In cases like these, I just use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en">Reader Mode</a>.</p><h3 id="grammarly"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en">Grammarly</a></h3><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en">Grammarly</a> effortlessly corrects any pesky spelling and grammatical mistakes I make.</p><h3 id="video-speed-controller"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en">Video Speed Controller</a></h3><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en">Video Speed Controller</a> allows you to control the playback speed on any site. Set the default pace to 1.10x and you'll go through videos 10% faster without even noticing. Or if you're on other end of the spectrum like me, and Youtube's 2x doesn't match your pace, set it to 2.5x+ to get through lengthy monologues as fast as possible 😼</p><h3 id="the-great-suspender"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en">The Great Suspender</a></h3><p>Makes Chrome use less resources by suspending tabs you're not using. Computers run much more smoothly when this is enabled, especially if you're a compulsive tab opener.</p><h3 id="tab-snooze"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en">Tab Snooze</a></h3><p>Ran into an interesting rabbit hole or website that you'd really like to check out, but don't have the time right now? Use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en">Tab Snooze</a>, and it'll magically reopen the tabs later.</p><h3 id="google-keep-notion-web-clipper"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en">Google Keep</a>/ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en">Notion Web Clipper</a></h3><p>I used to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en">Google Keep</a> heavily before, to save snippets and links and to add my own notes to the stuff I read online, but I've started moving towards <a href="https://blog.maskys.com/my-best-chrome-extensions/notion.so">Notion</a> these days, as it's a lot more organized. An important feature both have is that they're cross-platform, which means I can type out a fresh thought on my phone and flesh out the concept on my PC later.</p><h3 id="news-feed-eradicator-for-facebook"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en">News Feed Eradicator for Facebook</a></h3><p>I rarely use FB these days, and that's in large part thanks to this extension. I can just pop in to share something interesting or to tell people NOT to message me on Messenger, without being sucked in by the infinite feed.</p><h3 id="minimal-twitter"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp?hl=en">Minimal Twitter</a></h3><p>I do use Twitter, and this completely cleans up the interface. I mean, just look at this demo video</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOkKhPiUYxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="view-image"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/view-image/jpcmhcelnjdmblfmjabdeclccemkghjk?hl=en">View Image</a></h3><p>Brings back the view image button on Google Images! 🤗</p><h3 id="simplify-gmail"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj/related?hl=en">Simplify Gmail</a></h3><p>Recommended by <a href="https://twitter.com/matejmecka?lang=en">Matej</a>, this lovely extension cleans up Gmail's UI and hides the obnoxious logo.</p><hr><h2 id="nerd-section">Nerd Section</h2><p>These extensions aren't for everyone, but as a developer/designer they're super nifty.</p><h3 id="refined-github"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf?hl=en">Refined Github</a></h3><p>Super awesome extension that adds tons of features to Github.</p><h3 id="whatfont"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en">WhatFont</a></h3><p>Enable WhatFont, hover over any text on any site, and you'll instantly be shown the font family and other text properties!

The results are pretty basic though, so if I want to dig deeper I just end up googling it.</p><h3 id="epubpress"><a href="https://blog.maskys.com/p/40951844-a4a2-4b15-9442-1da99e6736b6/">Epubpress</a></h3><p>Whenever I have a lengthy article that I want to take my time to read, like this guide on <a href="https://www.narative.co/articles/building-product-market-fit-with-relationship-marketing">Building product-market fit with relationship marketing</a><strong>, </strong>I use EpubPress to turn it into an .epub that I can later read offline, usually on my Kindle.</p><hr><p>Aand that's it! This is my list as of now. I'd be happy to discover your favorite extensions- just leave a comment.

<p>Fred is on your team. He takes 5 times longer to build a feature than anyone else. When asked what’s the hold up, Fred responds that he’s tweaking a class definition or adding some out of scope automation instead of just building the dang thing that the ticket says to build. Fred drives the team nuts, and he often gets called a gold plater, or unproductive, or slow. </p>



<p>But in my experience, Fred isn’t slow at all. He’s just as productive as everyone else, but he’s solving different problems than the ones he was asked to solve.</p>



<p><strong>Fred is more interested in providing value to other developers than to users.</strong> </p>



<p>Your team probably pushes back on that. Fred’s feedback (if he gets any at all, which is a topic for another post) is that he needs to work on his velocity and get through his tickets faster. In other words, you’re telling him to stop doing the thing that he loves. He can’t just change his interest, so the best case scenario is that he’ll push hard for a few months on the boring stuff until he burns out and quits, or falls back into his old habits.</p>



<p>Maybe Fred doesn’t need to change. Maybe he’s just <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331248">in the wrong seat</a>. What if the team leaned into what gets Fred excited? If he doesn’t care about providing value to users, but loves providing value to his fellow developers, then could that be his full time job? His responsibilities could include:</p>



<ul><li>Automating anything that can possibly be automated</li><li>Making local environments run faster and smoother</li><li>Refactoring and managing tech debt</li><li>Quick and thorough code review</li><li>Streamlining the deploy process</li><li>Writing missing automated tests</li></ul>



<p>Doesn’t it seem powerful, to have a person on your team completely dedicated to helping other developers be as productive as they can be? Imagine reaching out to Fred the second you had code ready for review, or when a build fails and you aren’t sure why, or when your can’t figure out why your debugger stopped debugging, or when you notice that some function over here basically does the same thing as some other function over there. </p>



<p>He loves that stuff, and he’s probably really good at it, because as they say, “being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points”. So maybe try letting him do it?</p>

August 11, 2020 | http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WebAssembly (wasm) allows code written in languages other than JavaScript to run on browsers. If you haven’t been paying attention, all the major browsers support wasm and <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">globally more than 90% of users</a> have browsers that can run wasm.</p>
<p>Since Rust compiles to wasm, is it possible to build SPAs (Single Page Applications) purely in Rust and without writing a single line of JavaScript? The short answer is YES! Read on to learn more or visit the <a href="https://rustmart-yew.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo site</a> if you can’t contain your excitement!</p>
<p>We’ll be building a simple ecommerce site called “RustMart” that will have 2 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>HomePage - list all the products that the customer can add to cart</li>
<li>ProductDetailPage - show the product details when a product card is clicked</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m using this example as it tests the minimal set of capabilities required to build modern SPAs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate between multiple pages without page reload</li>
<li>Make network requests without page reload</li>
<li>Ability to reuse UI components across multiple pages</li>
<li>Update components in different layers of the UI hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Follow this <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to install Rust if you haven’t done so already.</p>
<p>Install these Rust tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install wasm-pack          # Compile Rust to Wasm and generate JS interop code
$ cargo install cargo-make         # Task runner
$ cargo install simple-http-server # Simple server to serve assets</code></pre>
<p>Create a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --lib rustmart &amp;&amp; cd rustmart</code></pre>
<p>We’ll be using the <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Yew</code></a> library to build UI components. Let’s add this and wasm dependencies to <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
yew = "0.17"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"</code></pre>
<p>Create a new file named <code>Makefile.toml</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code>[tasks.build]
command = "wasm-pack"
args = ["build", "--dev", "--target", "web", "--out-name", "wasm", "--out-dir", "./static"]
watch = { ignore_pattern = "static/*" }

[tasks.serve]
command = "simple-http-server"
args = ["-i", "./static/", "-p", "3000", "--nocache", "--try-file", "./static/index.html"]</code></pre>
<p>Start the build task:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make build</code></pre>
<p>If you’re new to Rust, I’ve written some <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/tags/Rust-Beginners/">guides for beginners</a> which will help you follow this post better.</p>
<h2 id="Hello-World"><a href="#Hello-World" title="Hello World"></a>Hello World</h2><p>Let’s start with a simple “hello world” example:</p>
<p>Create <code>static/index.html</code> and add this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>en<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>RustMart<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>title</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>module<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Add this to <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<p>Lot of things going on but you can see that we’re creating a new component named “Hello” that renders <code>&lt;span&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;</code> into the DOM. We’ll learn more about Yew components later.</p>
<p>Start the serve task in a new terminal and load <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo make serve</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It works!! It’s only “hello world” but this is fully written in Rust.</p>
<p>Let’s learn about components and other SPA concepts before proceeding further.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-in-Components"><a href="#Thinking-in-Components" title="Thinking in Components"></a>Thinking in Components</h2><p>Building UIs by composing components and passing data in a unidirectional way is a paradigm shift in the frontend world. It’s a huge improvement in the way we reason about UI and it’s very hard to go back to imperative DOM manipulation once you get used to this.</p>
<p>A <code>Component</code> in libraries like React, Vue, Yew, Flutter etc have these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to be composed into bigger components</li>
<li><code>Props</code> - Pass data and callbacks from that component to its child components.</li>
<li><code>State</code> - Manipulate state local to that component.</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> - Manipulate global state.</li>
<li>Listen to lifecycle events like “Instantiated”, “Mounted in DOM” etc</li>
<li>Perform side effects like fetching remote data, manipulating localstorage etc</li>
</ul>
<p>A component gets updated (re-rendered) when one of the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parent component is re-rendered</li>
<li><code>Props</code> changes</li>
<li><code>State</code> changes</li>
<li><code>AppState</code> changes</li>
</ul>
<p>So, instead of imperatively updating the UI when user interaction, network requests etc happen, we update the data (Props, State, AppState) and the UI is updated based on this data. This what someone means when they say “UI is a function of state”.</p>
<p>The exact details differ across different libraries but this should give you a general idea. If you’re new to this, this way of thinking might take sometime to “click” and get used to.</p>
<h2 id="HomePage"><a href="#HomePage" title="HomePage"></a>HomePage</h2><p>Let’s build the HomePage first. We’ll be building the HomePage as a monolithic component and later decompose it into smaller reusable components.</p>
<p>Let’s create the following files:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>use</span> yew<span>:</span><span>:</span>prelude<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> Home <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> Component <span>for</span> Home <span>{</span>
    <span>type</span> Message <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>type</span> Properties <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        Self <span>{</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> _<span>:</span> Self<span>:</span><span>:</span>Message<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> ShouldRender <span>{</span>
        <span>true</span>

    <span>fn</span> <span>view</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Html <span>{</span>
        <span>html!</span> <span>{</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>"Home Sweet Home!"</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>mod</span> home<span>;</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> home<span>:</span><span>:</span>Home<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s update the <code>src/lib.rs</code> to import the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  // src/lib.rs
<span>+ mod pages;</span>

<span>+ use pages::Home;</span>
  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>- struct Hello {}</span>

<span>- impl Component for Hello {</span>
<span>-     type Message = ();</span>
<span>-     type Properties = ();</span>

<span>-     fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {</span>
<span>-         Self {}</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {</span>
<span>-         true</span>
<span>-     }</span>

<span>-     fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {</span>
<span>-         html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Hello World!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-     }</span>
<span>- }</span>

  #[wasm_bindgen(start)]
  pub fn run_app() {
<span>-   App::&lt;Hello&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
<span>+   App::&lt;Home&gt;::new().mount_to_body();</span>
  }</code></pre>
<p>Now, you should see “Home Sweet Home!” instead of “Hello World!” rendered in your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s start designing the <code>State</code> of this component:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to store a list of products retrieved from server</li>
<li>Store the products the user has added to cart</li>
</ul>
<p>We create a simple struct to hold the <code>Product</code> details:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Product <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    description<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    image<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    price<span>:</span> f64<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We then create a new struct <code>State</code> with field called <code>products</code> to hold the products from server:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> State <span>{</span>
    products<span>:</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>Product<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the full list of changes in the HomePage component:</p>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ struct Product {</span>
<span>+     id: i32,</span>
<span>+     name: String,</span>
<span>+     description: String,</span>
<span>+     image: String,</span>
<span>+     price: f64,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>+ struct State {</span>
<span>+     products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

<span>- pub struct Home {}</span>
<span>+ pub struct Home {</span>
<span>+     state: State,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  impl Component for Home {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Self {
<span>+       let products: Vec&lt;Product&gt; = vec![</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 1,</span>
<span>+               name: "Apple".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/apple.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 3.65,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+           Product {</span>
<span>+               id: 2,</span>
<span>+               name: "Banana".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               description: "An old banana leaf was once young and green".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               image: "/products/banana.png".to_string(),</span>
<span>+               price: 7.99,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       ];</span>

<span>-       Self {}</span>
<span>+       Self {</span>
<span>+           state: State {</span>
<span>+               products,</span>
<span>+           },</span>
<span>+       }</span>
      }

      fn update(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Message) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn change(&amp;mut self, _: Self::Properties) -&gt; ShouldRender {
          true
      }

      fn view(&amp;self) -&gt; Html {
<span>+        let products: Vec&lt;Html&gt; = self</span>
<span>+            .state</span>
<span>+            .products</span>
<span>+            .iter()</span>
<span>+            .map(|product: &amp;Product| {</span>
<span>+                html! {</span>
<span>+                  &lt;div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;img src={&amp;product.image}/&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{&amp;product.name}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                    &lt;div&gt;{"$"}{&amp;product.price}&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>+                }</span>
<span>+            })</span>
<span>+            .collect();</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+        html! { &lt;span&gt;{products}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
<span>-        html! { &lt;span&gt;{"Home!"}&lt;/span&gt; }</span>
      }
  }</code></pre>
<p>The <code>create</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is created and this is where we set the initial state. For the time being, we’ve created a mock list of products and assigned it to the <code>products</code> inside the state as initial value. Later, we’ll fetch this list using network request.</p>
<p>The <code>view</code> lifecycle method is invoked when the component is rendered. Here we’ve iterated over <code>products</code> inside state to generate product cards. If you’re familiar with React, this is same as the <code>render</code> method and the <code>html!</code> macro is similar to <code>JSX</code>.</p>
<p>Save some random images as <code>static/products/apple.png</code> and <code>static/products/banana.png</code> and you’ll get this UI:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-wasm-yew-single-page-application/image-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s implement the “add to cart” functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep track of all products added to cart in a new state field called <code>cart_products</code></li>
<li>We render a “add to cart” button for each product</li>
<li>Add logic to update the <code>cart_products</code> state when “add to cart” button is clicked</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  use yew::prelude::*;

<span>+ #[derive(Clone)]</span>
  struct Product {
      id: i32,
      name: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      price: f64,
  }

<span>+ struct CartProduct {</span>
<span>+     product: Product,</span>
<span>+     quantity: i32,</span>
<span>+ }</span>

  struct State {
      products: Vec&lt;Product&gt;,
<span>+     cart_products: Vec&lt;CartProduct&gt;,</span>
  }

  pub struct Home {
      …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>B J Fogg is a Stanford professor who came up with a simple model of behavior that helps us understand why we take action or not take action at any given moment.</p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>According to FBM, there are three things we need to do something:</p><ul><li>Motivation</li><li>Ability</li><li>Trigger</li></ul><p>The key is that we need to have all three at the same time in order to act.</p><p>Since our problem is procrastination, we'll focus on how we fail at each one of these.</p><h2>Motivation X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_motivation.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no motivation"><p>Sometimes we have the ability to do something, and even have a trigger like a time window and a to-do item, but we don't feel motivated.</p><p>We stare at a list of tasks, and stare, and stare, and none of them seem particularly exciting.</p><p>So we do something else - procrastinate.</p><p>The thing is,&nbsp;<strong>motivation doesn't come out of the blue.</strong></p><p>We often have a fantasy in our heads of ourselves, sitting down to work, feeling inspired and tearing into work with a smile on our faces.</p><p>That's often not how it goes.</p><p>On the days when we don't feel motivated,&nbsp;<strong>we need to build motivation.</strong></p><h3>How to build motivation</h3><p>We feel motivated when we viscerally feel how an action is&nbsp;<strong>meaningful, or valuable</strong>&nbsp;to us and when we&nbsp;<strong>believe we can</strong>&nbsp;take it (we'll get to this in the next part).</p><p>Therefore, we don't feel motivated when we don't see the meaning or value hiding behind a to-do item.</p><p>What to do about it then?</p><p><strong>Remind yourself of the why.</strong></p><p>There probably was a reason why you wrote down a task or got one assigned to you.</p><p>Was it to help you learn something?        Was it to make you money?        Was it to help someone?</p><p>Take a task you're putting off, and try to remember in vivid detail why you thought you needed to do it.</p><p>The important part is not only to know the reason, but to feel it, to get excited about it. How to do that? Link the task to a personal goal that you want to achieve. Attach exciting reasons to the task.</p><p><em>Write a thesis</em>&nbsp;  - not motivating.</p><p>Write a thesis to successfully complete a degree and do cutting-edge research.<br>Write a thesis to deepen your understanding of a subject and get recognized by others in your field.<br>Write a thesis to help others see things more clearly and make progress.</p><p><strong>Add personal, meaningful reasons to the tasks that you put off. Make yourself remember why you took them on.</strong></p><h2>Ability X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_ability.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no ability"><p>Sometimes we feel motivated, but every task on our plate seems just too darn hard, like standing at the foot of 5 different mountains in the Himalayas and having to decide which one to climb.</p><p>When everything seems hard, it's easy to succumb to procrastination and check email, or social media, or play games. All those actions are much easier than&nbsp;<em>work.</em></p><p>But when&nbsp;<strong>we're finally done with our procrastination, we'll often find that our work hasn't gotten any easier while we procrastinated.</strong>&nbsp;In fact, it seems even harder.</p><p>That's clearly not a good cycle.</p><p>Instead of avoiding anything hard, let's&nbsp;<strong>turn down the difficulty dial by focusing on small steps.</strong></p><p>You probably can't climb the whole mountain at once, but you can ascend a few hundred feet.        You probably can't write a whole thesis at once, but you can write 5 paragraphs.        You probably can't build a business at once, but you can write a blog post, or design a prototype, or contact 10 prospects.</p><p>In short, you need to&nbsp;<strong>break it down</strong>&nbsp;into pieces you are able to complete.</p><h3>How to break work down</h3><p>With mental work, it's often not obvious what all the things we need to do are.</p><p>We need to identify them, to list them.</p><p>If you need to create a presentation, you'll need to research the topic, find images, create the slides, and rehearse. Those are 4 distinct types of activity, 4 smaller pieces that you can take on, one by one.</p><p>When you break down work into parts, it becomes clearer what you feel you can or cannot do.</p><p><strong>Identify the distinct parts that form the whole.</strong></p><p>But even when you identify the parts, they can still intimidate you and seem too hard in their own right. What to do then?</p><p><strong>Create a simple timeline.</strong></p><p>We aren't naturally good at planning work through time. We don't look at a task like "Create a sales report" and see a detailed calendar in our heads with all the tasks neatly organized.</p><p>But we can learn to do that. How?</p><p>We just need a simple timeline.</p><p>It doesn't have to be complicated.</p><ol><li>Start with the due date.</li><li>Go back day by day (or week by week) and write down what you'd like to have done by then, until you arrive at today.</li><li>Put this timeline where you'll see it (remember: out of sight, out of mind).</li><li>Start working on the first piece of the puzzle.</li></ol><p>You might have a 20 slide presentation you'll be delivering 10 days from now.</p><p><em>Day 10</em>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rehearse 3x and deliver presentation</li></ul><p><em>Day 9</em></p><ul><li>Add finishing touches</li><li>List sources</li></ul><p>...</p><p><em>Day 5</em></p><ul><li>Create first 10 slides</li></ul><p><em>Day 3</em></p><ul><li>Write out the main points</li></ul><p><em>Day 2</em></p><ul><li>Read through the materials</li></ul><p><em>Day 1</em></p><ul><li>Make a list of at least 10 articles and other resources to use</li></ul><p>Even a simple, bulleted timeline like this can make a large project more manageable and ensure that you have the time to learn what you need to do to be able to accomplish your mission.</p><h2>Trigger X Procrastination</h2><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm_no_trigger.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model - no trigger"><p>And sometimes, we feel motivated and able, but we don't know where to start - we're missing a trigger.</p><p>Professional athletes have a coach. Coach is the person who says what to do, and when. Their job is about motivating, cultivating ability, and giving triggers.</p><p>Now do this, now that, now this here, now rest. There's a tight, minute-by-minute plan.</p><p>As a result, the athletes know exactly what to focus on at any given moment.</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>modern work often doesn't have a built-in trigger.</strong></p><p>A professor doesn't tell you when to research, when to write an outline, when to start writing, when to stop writing, when to edit... there are no stopwatches, only vague directions and loooong time windows (days, weeks, months - not minutes).</p><p>As a result,&nbsp;<strong><em>we</em>&nbsp;have to make the decision to start—we have to trigger ourselves into action.</strong></p><p>In effect, we often leave the trigger to circumstance - we start working just before a deadline because we suddenly understand that if we don't start RIGHT NOW, we won't make it. Deadline becomes the only trigger we obey.</p><p>But that doesn't make for a consistent work ethic and healthy work-related confidence.</p><h2>How to add a trigger</h2><p>The key to an effective trigger is a sense of&nbsp;<em>I'm supposed to be doing this, right now.</em></p><p>The timeline exercise from the previous section can help with the first part - identifying a concrete task that will be triggered. However, a timeline doesn't provide us with a&nbsp;<em>cue.</em></p><p>We need to&nbsp;<strong>create a cue.</strong></p><p>One moment that can be used as a trigger is sitting down to work.&nbsp;<strong>When you sit down to work, you can take your to-do list and give yourself 5-15 minutes to decide which task to start with.</strong>&nbsp;If you don't know after the time has passed, pick one at random.<br>Cue #1: sitting down to work = time to find the first task.<br>Cue #2: time limit ends = time to work.</p><p>Another cue takes a little foresight and preparation.</p><p><strong>At the end of one work day, determine where you want to start the next day and put it into your calendar.</strong></p><p>Want to start writing a doc for your teammate? Put it on your calendar at 9–9:30AM, add a reminder and a link to the doc.</p><p>Want to start with a brainstorm? Take a sheet of paper, write the topic in its center, and put it on your desk so that it's the first thing you see tomorrow morning.</p><p>Want to start by looking up flights for a business trip? Download a picture of a plane and make it your wallpaper.</p><p>You can be as creative as you want, but the main point is this:<br><strong>define a specific task to do, at a specific place, at a specific moment in time - and make sure you can't miss the cue.</strong></p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/fbm.png" alt="Fogg Behavior Model"><p>That's it.</p><p>Build up your motivation by reinforcing personal, meaningful reasons to do something.</p><p>Break down complex tasks into simple parts and plan them through time by creating a simple timeline.</p><p>And define a concrete trigger that will help you start your work.</p><br><hr><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-stop-procrastinating-by-using-the-fogg-behavior-model-part-2">Read How to stop procrastinating by using the Fogg Behavior Model - Part 2 here</a></p></article></div>]]>

This idea took root and, over the years, we've gradually started tackling the surrounding challenges, such as:</p><ul><li><p>a fast and reliable build system much needed in front-end development, </p></li><li><p>various JS interop features that spawned an ecosystem of well typed libraries,</p></li><li><p>a production-ready standard library,</p></li><li><p>and recently, a fresh, solid syntax.</p></li></ul><p>These developments have attracted many people into our community. But one bigger challenge persisted: newcomers dropped out at the sheer amount of extra incongruent tools and learning overhead from having to understand OCaml concepts, Reason concepts, and BuckleScript's own concepts. Take, for example, what's required to make a ReasonReact app:</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge of React.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of JS.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of ReasonReact's specific idioms (that we've tried hard to keep to a minimum).</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of OCaml idioms, on top of which BuckleScript is built.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of BuckleScript's JS interop and the build system.</p></li><li><p>Knowledge of the Reason syntax.</p></li></ul><p>Ironically, the more documentation we pile up, the more mental overhead newcomers suffered. During the various BuckleScript &amp; Reason meetups, we've frequently seen folks' enthusiasm crushed at the sheer prospect of making a web app while keeping 5+ tabs' worth of documentations open. This was discouraging, both for said eager developers and for us maintainers. </p><p>The adoption barrier is real, and it's about time we finally solve it.</p><p>Today, we'll start to truly unify the various BuckleScript-related projects under a single name: ReScript. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>The compiler, the build system and the syntax unified and shipping under a single install. Likewise for future efforts such as editor plugin.</p></li><li><p>A single documentation site which covers the above: <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">rescript-lang.org</a>.</p></li><li><p>Streamlined communication through said website, a <a href="https://forum.rescript-lang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new dedicated forum</a> and a new <a href="http://twitter.com/rescriptlang" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter account</a>.</p></li><li><p>The renaming of various tools, always in a backward-compatible way.</p></li></ul><p>In short, all JS-related tools are now called ReScript. Previously, due to the messy situation, most real-world BuckleScript adoption came from a few heroic community members suffering through the technical and social risk of spreading our tech to their coworkers. From today onward, you can simply tell to your coworkers: "this is ReScript", and point to them a clear starting point instead of sending them to various incompatible sources, with a risk of losing goodwill and credibility.</p><p>It's worth emphasizing that while this rebranding seems to be very disruptive, in reality it's mostly a bunch of name changes for the same tech. To reiterate our stance on existing userland code:</p><ul><li><p>Please read our <a href="https://reasonml.org/blog/a-note-on-bucklescripts-future-commitments" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> on backward compatibility with pure OCaml &amp; Reason syntax.</p></li><li><p>The current Reason website will keep existing, with proper redirects to our new one when relevant. Existing Reason-to-JS users' code keep working, as per above post. Reason itself will continue tackling the parts BuckleScript didn't tackle before, such as native.</p></li><li><p>The various BuckleScript binaries will keep working. Instead of renaming those, we'd create new binaries instead.</p></li><li><p>The BuckleScript docs will redirect to the new site without breaking links.</p></li></ul><p>Thank you for your support and keep shipping. A brighter future awaits us!</p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>The ReScript team (Bob, Cheng, Cristiano, Maxim, Patrick, Ricky).</p></div></div></div>]]>

Since steel’s decline more than 30 years ago, the Mon Valley community has suffered from chronic disinvestment.</p>  <p>“When you look at what changed, it was the community aspect of it. It’s like, let’s get back to relying on one another and building up ourselves,” Reyes says as traffic rolls through Braddock’s commercial district, a sparse collection of businesses scattered among empty storefronts and vacant lots.</p>  <p>Reyes is the director of Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a grassroots group that links volunteers with people who need services such as a car ride or home repair. The goal, Reyes says, is to establish an “alternative economy.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" alt="As director of the grassroots group Neighbors Helping Neighbors, Jona Reyes has helped to build a network of about 200 residents who can offer and solicit services such as car rides or home repairs. The residents live in Braddock, North Braddock, and neighboring communities." data-interchange-default="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" data-interchange-small="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/small/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" data-interchange-medium="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg" data-interchange-large="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/large/public/202008/IMG_6592.jpg">            </a></p>   </div> </div>   <p>“Our needs can be met, especially in low-income communities … if we lean on one another and look out for one another,” Reyes says.</p>  <p>Reyes’ group got a boost earlier this year from an organization called involveMINT. About five years ago, involveMINT developed a digital currency, called “time credits,” to share with people who invest their time in the community. The East Liberty-based venture initially focused its efforts in Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood. But by working with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, the group hopes to begin circulating time credits in and around Braddock.</p>  <p>So far, involveMINT and Neighbors Helping Neighbors have enlisted about 10 local businesses to accept the credits as payment. While the units <a href="https://www.theselc.org/community-currencies-faq">are considered taxable earnings</a>, they reflect a deeper contribution to the community, said involveMINT executive director Dan Little.</p>  <p>“Money is scarce in the communities that arguably would need it most,”&nbsp; Little noted of the lack of funding in places like Braddock. “So the idea is [that] by having an alternative currency, you’re creating an alternative channel for commerce to happen, when that money is not available.”</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6595.jpg" alt="Dan Little, executive director of involveMINT, began to develop time credits as an alternative form of currency in 2015. His organization first arranged a program in Hazelwood, where participants earn time credits for collecting food waste and turning it into compost. They can redeem the credits at Dylamato's Market in Hazelwood.

The idea <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/11/local-currencies-ithaca_cz_el_money06_0214local.html#eb379bf5b4cd">grew especially popular during the Great Depression</a>, when market failures dried up the supply of cash in circulation. Propronents say alternative currencies help to stimulate local economies by encouraging firms and residents to do business with others who participate in their community's homegrown currency system.</p>  <p>Little added that COVID-19, and the economic turmoil it has caused, further underscore the value of reducing communities’ reliance on dollars.</p>  <p>Although the federal government has <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center#eligibility">distributed coronavirus stimulus payments to qualifying households</a>, Little noted, “for many people, that barely covers rent … And with local businesses, we know that they have seen a tremendous decrease in revenue.”</p>  <p>By using time credits created, or minted, by involveMINT, Little said, businesses can establish a new source of revenue, and use those funds to buy more supplies locally. Little noted that the coronavirus pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains.</p>  <p>“[The new currency] may not be a panacea. It’s not going to pay for everything. But it’s going to get [users] some access to things that are local,” Little said.</p>  <p><strong>‘It will help to unify the community’</strong></p>  <p>COVID-19 prompted Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT to launch a grocery delivery service as one option for earning time credits. The program aims to help those who are vulnerable to the disease and, thus, should avoid stores.</p>  <p>Retiree Cynthia Underwood is one of several community members who have signed up to make deliveries. Her clients include seniors such as Myrtle Walker, who’s physically unable to go down stairs. In fact, when Underwood makes a delivery, the 72-year-old drops a key from her second-floor apartment window so that Underwood can let herself in.</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/myrtle_walker_2.jpg" alt="Braddock resident Myrtle Walker relies on an oxygen generator to manage her lung disease.

Each unit is supposed to be worth a dollar. But for Underwood, a native of Rankin, the most important benefit is the possibility that participants will invest in each other.</p>  <p>“I think it will help to unify the community a little more and have people have a more vested interest in each other,” Underwood said.</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg" alt="Cynthia Underwood previously worked for the Internal Revenue Service, but now that she's retired, she volunteers frequently in Pittsburgh's east suburbs. She delivers groceries once or twice a week in exchange for time credits." data-interchange-default="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg" data-interchange-small="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/small/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg" data-interchange-medium="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg" data-interchange-large="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/large/public/202008/IMG_6623.jpg">            </a></p>   </div> </div>  <p>Urban agriculture nonprofit Grow Pittsburgh found similar reasons to accept time credits at its produce stand in Braddock for similar reasons. Grow Pittsburgh’s director of farm education, Denele Hughson, said time credits are rooted in the same philosophy as her organization, which strives to empower communities like Braddock to draw on existing assets to cultivate their own food economies.</p>  <p>Hughson noted that her organization can use the time credits to buy compost from the local company Worm Return. And she said Grow Pittsburgh will use the units to pay for a few additional hours of work at its urban farm.</p>  <p>“Someone who’s just looking to volunteer for a few hours a week, and in exchange for that they actually get something tangible that they can use it on&nbsp;– I think that would be amazing,” Hughson said.</p>  <p><strong>‘Funny money?’</strong></p> <p>The success of any currency, including the dollar, depends on whether people trust it. And whether they trust it depends on how much they see others use it.</p>  <p>Circulation has been a challenge for local currencies elsewhere. In Ithaca, N.Y., for example, a currency called Ithaca HOURS went defunct after about two decades. Erik Lehmann was the last person to chair the Ithaca HOURS board.</p>  <p>“Towards the end, it was basically like a coupon,” he said of the HOURS. “It wasn’t a full currency. Most vendors that accepted it didn’t accept it at full face value.”</p> <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" alt="Grow Pittsburgh is one of about 10 local organizations that have agreed to accept time credits as payment. The urban agriculture nonprofit operates a farm and produce stand in Braddock." data-interchange-default="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" data-interchange-small="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/small/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" data-interchange-medium="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg" data-interchange-large="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/large/public/202008/grow_pittsburgh_farm_stand.jpg">            </a></p>   </div> </div>   <p>Lehmann said there were not enough ways in Ithaca to redeem the alternative currency. While at one time about 300 businesses had signed up to accept the HOURS, Lehamann said, “There weren’t the Wegman’s and the big banks and the big landlords."</p>  <p>In Philadelphia, a local currency called Equal Dollars <a href="https://generocity.org/philly/2014/07/14/equal-dollars-alternative-currency-out-of-circulation-after-19-years/">faced a similar hurdle</a>, though it too had been in circulation for about 20 years. Former Equal Dollars director Deneene Brockington said, because most businesses had nowhere to spend Equal Dollars, they simply donated them to charities of their choosing.</p>  <p>“That kind of resonated with some people and some local businesses: They got to participate in something local and then donate to a community organization that then was able to use those dollars as a way to thank their people for community service,” Brockington said.</p>  <p>Equal Dollars ultimately dissolved in 2014 because, Brockington said, the nonprofit that ran it, Resources for Human Development, decided to stop funding the program. Brockington noted that staffers like her, who managed the Equal Dollars program, still needed to be paid in U.S. dollars. After all, they couldn't use alternative currency to pay their bills.</p>  <p>Scott Morris, who is leading an effort to launch a new currency in Ithaca, called Ithacash, has also struggled to secure funding for personnel. He said it's a necessary expense, to ensure that professionals can educate people and businesses on how to use the units, recruit more participants into the network, and manage the complexities associated with sustaining that network.</p>  <p>"The business model has never been easy to deal with because it’s like, ‘Look, we’re making our own money, and so you should pay us some regular money for it.’ And [potential funders] are just going to be like, ‘Well, this is the real money. Why do you want my real money for your funny money?’” Morris said.</p>  <div>   <div>     <p><a href="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/x_large/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg">       <img src="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" alt="Neighbors Helping Neighbors and involveMINT receive some donations for their grocery delivery service from Dorothy Gey's food distribution site in Braddock. Gey receives contributions from 412 Food Rescue, Gordon Food Service, and local food pantries." data-interchange-default="https://www.wesa.fm/sites/wesa/files/styles/default/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" data-interchange-small="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/small/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" data-interchange-medium="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/medium/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg" data-interchange-large="https://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/styles/large/public/202008/IMG_6601.jpg">            </a></p>   </div> </div>  <p>But Morris noted that mainstream investors have <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/03/sustainable-investing-esg-covid-19-social-environmental-causes/">grown increasingly conscious of the social and environmental impacts of their contributions investments</a>, and that COVID-19 has shaken people’s confidence in traditional markets.</p>  <p>“Now, I think we’re at the point … where we can make a very solid business case for why these [local currency models] are worth paying regular money for,” he said.</p>  <p>In Pittsburgh, involveMINT’s Dan Little said his bottom line is whether the communities that use his organization's time credits gain the resources they need to invest in themselves.</p>  <p>Considering the market hasn't addressed this need, Little said, the credits' fate is “almost in some ways about survival. It’s like … let’s see what the community can do to help itself.”</p> </div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>If you are someone like me who spends hours and hours a day typing then you
might be interested in investing in learning how to properly type, more
precisely on learning how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch-type</a>.
My story begins 2 years ago when I saw one person typing so fluently and elegantly with almost no effort, focusing on
the result and not the process that it triggered in me to start noting how
badly I was typing and how badly many others were typing.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost all people are a self-taught typist and everyone
with their technique, this technique is usually correlated with inefficiency,
and sometimes speed. I saw many people typing very fast with only 4 fingers, which
in result makes more noise by jumping from one letter to another very fast but
on that particular keyboard, on another keyboard they would struggle because
the muscle memory doesn’t recognize a different keyboard. And it makes so much
harder improving the speed when not using all of your fingers.</p>
<p>I had the same problem as the majority of people, and I wasn’t recognizing it.
For years I would use 4-6 fingers and always from time to time I would
take a look at the keyboard for a specific character or a letter. The right
hand would type the keys on the left side and opposite. That was my typing
technique.</p>
<p>So I started doing some research and got to know better how touch-typing works.
Luckily the web is full of touch-typing resources and training websites, that
I settled for <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">TypingClub</a>. The website is full of exercises and statistics
on your writing progress in beautiful UI that it satisfies all of my nerdy
requirements, and it’s completely free or supports the services and get some
additional features with as little as 7.50 euros a month.</p>

part was creating a practicing routing and trying to touch-type as much as
possible. That is easier said than done. The beggining was painful, I was slow at
work and I was wasting a lot of my concentration on typing. My fingers were
feeling tired and sometimes in pain, they have never done anything like that.
Changing the muscle memory and rewiring my brain after many years to something
almost unknown was getting into my way.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a switch from an <a href="https://amzn.to/31H9Qgc">Apple keyboard</a> to a mechanical keyboard.
And I got the idea that if I get a keyboard with the blank keycaps I would be
obligated to learn to touch-type and forget about looking at the keyboard. The
idea was promising but also scary for the scenarios like typing a password,
typing with one hand.. so again I did some research! And many people confirmed
my idea and I decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Finding a good keyboard that would last and endure a lot typing was my initial
idea, but there aren’t many keyboards with blank keycaps unless you customize
it. So the list came down to these candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3acp0On">Das Keyboard 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3kBK9WP">Filco Ninja Majestouch-2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2XQ3Mkj">Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Professional2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Filco keyboard is a little different than the other two, by having the keycaps
printed on the bottom side instead on top. This would work better in cases like
typing a password or typing anything with one hand. For someone who doesn’t
want to go extreme this is a good solution.</p>
<p>All of these keyboards are exceptionally good, but having already had
experience with MX Cherry switches, I decided to give a try to Topre
switches with an HHKB. It’s more Vim-style orianted by having no arrow keys
with a clean and minimal design.</p>

and the school to deep dive into this. At the begging I was struggling, but
a keyboard like this pushes you to learn a proper fingers placement on the
home row and unlink all the habits of looking down for a key. It took time
and a lot of practice but it paid off. Today I type comfortably on a blank
keyboard with the average speed of 70-90 wpm and I’m still improving. It is
a huge productivity boost.</p>

<p>I didn’t know that my next project will turn into a nudity platform and a home for spammers. But it did happen while I wasn’t paying attention. And here are the details.</p>



<p>For the next 5/10 years, I’ve decided that my mission will be: “<strong>Can a Moroccan build an online business and make a living from Morocco?</strong>“. I currently launch multiple projects and give them some time to take off. My blog <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>, my jobs board <a href="https://okjob.io/">okjob.io</a>, and other projects are all examples of this. The project I’m talking about today, was also serving the same purpose in theory, but it was a flop.</p>



<p>That project is <a href="https://mylink.fyi/">mylink.fyi</a>, a personal and unique link for all your other links. I built it during my weekends given I already have a full-time job and it took me two months approximately. It’s like <a href="https://linktr.ee/">linktree</a> and other competitors, but I tried to make it different. No ads, no logo, a clean interface, a 100% score in performance… My idea was: take a competitor product, remove all features you don’t need, and make it crazy fast. You have a 14 days free trial to test it out, but you need to upgrade your account afterwards.</p>



<p>I launched it in February 2020 with a completely different identity. I took my name, and thus my followers and my authority, out of the equation. <strong>I wanted to replicate “someone starting from scratch” as close as possible</strong>. I did use the service for my links (and <a href="https://remote.ma/">remote.ma</a>‘s links) but I never advertised the service on my personal account. You can see the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mylink-fyi">Product Hunt</a> launch, and the imaginary <a href="https://twitter.com/HamidNekcha">Twitter account</a> I created.</p>



<p>Given how I built the app, I optimized it in a way I’ll only pay hosting fees when the site is having a lot of traffic. Like 1M+ visits per month. So I forgot about it, and kept an eye on the bills I get. Two weeks after launch, I had 100 users. No premium account.</p>



<p>Three months went by with 0$ bills. But in June, I received <strong>my non-zero bill</strong>, it’s exciting the app is taking off! I logged to Firebase (the infrastructure I’m using) and found a total of 1000 users! Wow, that’s a lot.</p>



<p>I took a look at the emails, and quickly saw that something was off. I’ve seen multiple accounts with the same email structure, something like emily123@gmail.com, emily456@gmail.com… I knew something isn’t right given there is a lot of them. So I decided to take a closer look and see the links they are sharing.</p>



<p>That’s when I discovered <strong>they were sharing porn and nudes links</strong>. These links aren’t permitted on social media, so they used mylink.fyi to “shadow” them. For these platforms, they are mylink.fyi links. But once you visit it, you’ll see a link for the banned site. <strong>There were hundreds of accounts doing this</strong>. And new ones get created every day. Once the trial period is over, they create a new email, a new account, and then repeat the same process. Oups!</p>



<p>I decided to remove all my links from the platform given it’s probably known for “porn and nudes” now. I logged to Instagram, and got a weird message: “<strong>Your profile link is not working</strong>“. I didn’t know what that means, but once I visited my profile, I’ve seen I can’t click on the mylink.fyi link. Wow, what’s that? I visited my other profile, and got the same message and the same problem! I later discovered that Instagram banned all mylink.fyi links from the platform. A customer also confirmed to me via email that Snapchat started blocking links. Heh, I’m banned by Instagram and Snapchat! From all scenarios I had in mind, <strong>this is not something I prepared for</strong>.</p>



<p>The first thing I tried is reducing the trial period from 14 days to 5 days. I was hoping I’ll make them stop. But nothing changed, I can’t outplay them. Damn it! Other solutions include: requiring credit cards for trial periods, ban all adult content from the platform… But they all require me to put extra effort in the project. And I don’t have time for that.</p>



<p>I disabled signups on mylink.fyi for now, and after all trials reach their end, I’ll take the service off. If you’re interested in acquiring the domain name, and/or the app, <a href="https://elazzabi.com/contact/">let’s talk</a>.</p>



<p><strong>That’s it for your daily dose of weird Internet anecdotes.</strong></p>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There is a lot of praise for weekly reviews. There is noticeably less doing of weekly reviews, even among the people doing the praising. It’s a very hard habit to keep up. We could spend a lot of time diving into why that is and how to fix it in a systematic way… or I could tell you how I use <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook</a> to get many of the promised benefits of weekly reviews without any willpower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a nutshell, when I find myself making a choice about how to spend time or money that’s dependent on some expectation, I write out the expectation as a prediction (with % likelihood) in PredictionBook, which then automatically prompts me to evaluate the prediction at a date I set. This has so many benefits I’m struggling to figure out where to start. If I had to sum them up in a phrase, it would be “more contact with reality”. But to expand on that…</p>

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Q0ozB77P5ESZiGHUbcOOwEKmLkOnfe6DrHZJsRiJyWH8izn9qVWP2qO1dqem9SQO5si1RFMZ8UjhfGFKSqJkg8zcjvuo4g5_agcJ9Z610wSw-8WxabmUknYTMaXcEylDiS9WJL3Z" width="286" height="190"><figcaption>What contact with reality may look like</figcaption></figure>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Making the prediction forces me to assess my anticipated outcomes and do an expected value calculation. This in turn forces me to be explicit about what I value, and how I will know if I got it. It also makes it explicit when I’m doing something because I expect the median or modal outcome to be good, vs. when I’m doing it for the long tail of unlikely but super good outcomes. It also gives me a chance to say “huh, that EV is not competitive” and do something else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Evaluating the prompt gives me more information on how my plans are working out. <a href="https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work">Andy Matuschak</a> talks about the dilemma of knowledge work, where you can’t make a plan for success but leaving things open ended often leads nowhere. His solution to this is to give himself unstructured time, but then look back and see if it worked out the way he wanted, and if it didn’t, do something different next time. Predictions provide a really natural, lightweight prompt for this reflection.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes I withdraw a question for being poorly phrased- often when my answer makes the decision sound “bad” but I feel like it was actually “good”, or vice versa. This is an easy way to notice I was wrong about what I valued and look for what is actually driving my decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then there are the framing benefits. It’s easier to view something as an experiment if you’re explicitly writing down “5% chance of success”, which makes failure feel less bad. I didn’t fail to make something work, I executed the correct algorithm and it failed to produce results this particular time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Making an explicit prediction and writing it down closes open loops in my head, freeing RAM for other things.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s helpful to notice when the habit doesn’t trigger. For example, I have a meeting planned today (when I’m writing this) that I just “didn’t feel inspired” to make a prediction for. When I looked closer I realized that’s because I was kind of eh on this meeting but felt obliged to take it, and was avoiding that fact. I don’t know how this is going to work out because I’m choosing to work on this blog post before tackling that, but I still credit the prediction habit with noticing, which is the first step towards better choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also it seems like this might make my predictions more accurate, which has all kinds of applications. But to be honest that’s not what’s reinforcing this.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p dir="ltr">So we’re on the same page, here are some sample predictions, and the decisions that rested on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Reading Pavlov and his School will lead to behavior change in the area of learning or sleep (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Should I buy a physical copy of Pavlov and his School and spend the time to read it?</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Talking with my friend Jane on 8/1 will be energizing (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Jane?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Bob the recruiter will describe a job that I am at all capable of and interested in doing (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I take a call with Bob?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will judge the seminar on 7/28 will be worth the interruption of flow (40%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I spend money and time on this seminar?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Sam will finish task Y by 7/31 (20%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision riding on this one, but it sure seems useful to calibrate on how well I can predict a project partner’s productivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">I will play with an Oculus Quest at least an hour a week (98%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy a Quest?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">California will catch fire to the point I need to keep my windows closed (95%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy an air conditioner?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Company Z will offer me at least an hour of work (15%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">No immediate decision</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Supplement S will improve my sleep to the point I don’t need a nap (3%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Should I buy and use supplement S?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If I were starting from scratch, here are the instructions I would want to receive (many of which I did receive, from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a>)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create an account on <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook.com</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Go to Settings to correct your time zone and set your prediction default to “visible to creator” rather than “visible to public” (unless you’d like them to be public by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a handful of predictions that will resolve over the next week (PredictionBook will e-mail you when they should be resolved).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The goal is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Quickly get feedback about how this feels for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Get yourself in the habit of making and resolving predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When making predictions, try to hone in on things that are decision-relevant to you; that you would do something different based on if the prediction was true or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Create a link to <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new">https://predictionbook.com/predictions/new</a> in your browser so you can access it easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As you take more actions based on predictions (implicit or explicit), notice that you are doing so, and register the predictions in PredictionBook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Resolve predictions as you are prompted to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After a week or two, check in with yourself and how you feel about the project. For calibration: I found creating the initial predictions kind of a pain but by a week in the project was naturally rewarding and required no will power on my part.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">This should take &lt; 30 minutes, and it should take &lt; 45 minutes total to get a good sense of whether this is working for you.</p>

<h3>Why Does This Work?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been thinking a lot about flow and distraction recently. One thing I’ve noticed is that it takes an awful long time, measured in hours, to get into the mindset for certain tasks. Those tasks then feel amazing, unless I’m pulled out of them prematurely, which hurts (and makes it take even longer to get into the next time). There’s a lot of implications of this that I’ll hopefully get to in some other post; the relevance here is that I think weekly reviews might be one of those tasks that requires a lot of time to get into the required headspace and hurts to leave prematurely. This makes them costly- much more costly then I would have estimated before I learned to bill tasks for their prep time. It’s also something of an all or nothing task- doing 50% of your weekly review does not get you nearly 50% of the benefits of a full weekly review.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But predictions, both making and evaluating, integrate into my life pretty naturally most of the time, and scale gracefully. Writing them up can take as little as 15 seconds, and when it takes longer, it’s because I’ve discovered something important I need to work out. Doing this fits in naturally with the process of making plans, so I don’t need to spend time getting into the right head space. Evaluating them is usually trivial- and if it’s not, it’s highlighting a problem with my models.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p dir="ltr">“I will enjoy X” is very rarely the right prediction for me to make, because enjoyment is a tricky thing for me. I don’t like admitting I didn’t enjoy something, and sometimes I will burn a lot of energy trying to make something enjoyable, which can be a bad decision even if it works. My equivalent is “X will be energizing”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When trying to create predictions, think about what you’ll be spending money and time on in the next week. How do you think those things are going to go? What outcomes would make you change your decision?</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p dir="ltr">My original inspiration for this experiment, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jL7uDE5oH4HddYq4u/raemon-s-scratchpad?commentId=nuWrC9MxrgsjjS69W">Raemon</a>, hasn’t gotten the benefits I describe. He’s more focused on improving his prediction calibration and accuracy, and so far hasn’t done as much decision-relevant predictions. I’ve encouraged him to try it my way and hopefully he’ll comment after he’s spent a few weeks on that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PredictionBook is pleasantly lightweight but it’s already a little cluttered with predictions. If I really do solidify this habit I may need to find or create a better system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve been doing this for about a month. People have kept up weekly reviews for longer before letting them fall by the wayside. I’m writing this up now because the act of solidifying a habit makes me worse at writing about it. I’ve set a reminder for 12/1 to write an update.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Thanks to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon">Raemon</a> for pushing me to a better version this post and for initiating the experiment in the first place.</p>

These frameworks create a window which GoLang can inject HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the UI.</p><p id="c60c">But I don’t want to write JavaScript(!) and deal with all the complexities that comes with it like npm, webpack, typescript… Fortunately, I can just compile GoLang to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebAssembly</a> (WASM) and use that in place of JavaScript. WASM is a binary format that can be executed natively in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most modern browsers</a>. <em>My </em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maori.geek.nz/a-web-app-using-bazel-golang-wasm-and-proto-c020914f4341"><em>previous post</em></a><em> showed how to build a WASM web-app with the Bazel.</em></p><p id="14af">Also, using WASM in a desktop app (as opposed to a web app) dodges two of its main downsides:</p><ol><li id="a01f"><strong>Large WASM binaries</strong> (especially from GoLang): these take a long time to send over the network increasing loading times. In a desktop app the binary isn’t transferred over the network, so less overhead.</li><li id="c65b"><strong>Browser incompatibility: </strong>Some WebAssembly methods are unavailable in browsers and older browsers are not supported at all.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam carving</a> is a technique
for <em>content-aware resizing</em>, which changes the size of an image while
attempting to preserve the interesting content of the image. The basic
idea behind the technique is to remove <strong><em>low-energy seams</em></strong>: paths of pixels
that are similar to their surroundings. A removed seam can be either vertical or
horizontal, to reduce either the width or height of an image.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a panorama I took a few years ago near Spruce Knob, WV.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/pano.jpg"></p>

<p>The image is super wide, but we can carve it down.
Here’s an animation of the process, generated by the
<a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl/pull/123">seam-carver I implemented recently</a>
as a parallel benchmark for
<a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>.</p>

<p>Getting real parallel speedups in this implementation turned out to be an
interesting challenge. For typical images, which are fairly small,
I found that the most obvious approach for parallelizing the algorithm was not
able to extract enough parallelism, because it required too small of a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">grain size</a></em>.
So, I designed a new way of parallelizing the algorithm which works much
better on small images. This post presents some of the details.</p>

<h2 id="the-seam-carving-algorithm">The Seam Carving Algorithm</h2>

<p>The idea behind seam-carving is to consider all possible seams in an image,
select the one which is least important, and remove it. A <strong><em>seam</em></strong> is a path of
pixels that cuts across an image, touching one pixel in each row (or column)
along the way. When we remove a seam, we reduce either the width or height
of the image by 1. We can repeat this process as many times as desired to
shrink the image.</p>

<p>We’ll base the “importance” of seams on a notion of pixel <strong><em>energy</em></strong>, which
can be defined in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient">many different ways</a>.
For seam-carving, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference">color difference</a> gradient
seems to work well, which measures how different a pixel’s color is in
comparison to its surroundings. The <strong><em>energy of a seam</em></strong> is just the
cumulative energies of all pixels touched by the seam. With this setup,
the seam with <em>minimum energy</em> should be unimportant and safe to remove from
an image.</p>

<p>To compute <em>minimum seam energies</em>, we can use a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
algorithm. For simplicity here, let’s focus on vertical seams. Let
\(M(i,j)\) be the minimum energy of
any partial seam that ends at row \(i\) and column \(j\), and let
\(E(i,j)\) be the energy of the pixel at that position. These minimum seam
energies are related by the following equation:</p><p>

\[M(i,j) = E(i,j) + \min(M(i-1,j-1), M(i-1,j), M(i-1,j+1))\]

</p><p>A picture might help. For each position, we look at the minimum partial
seams that end above it, pick the smallest, and then add the next pixel.</p>

<p><img width="250px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/equation.svg"></p>

<p>Once \(M\) has been fully computed, we can find the minimum overall seam by
working backwards, from bottom to top, by walking upwards along the path of
minimum seam energies starting at the smallest in the bottommost row.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-minimum-seam-in-parallel">Finding the minimum seam in parallel</h2>



<p>The dependencies within the equation for \(M\) appear to offer a lot of
parallelism. Perhaps the most immediately obvious approach is to compute
\(M\) in <strong><em>row-major</em></strong> order,
where first we do all of row 0, and then all of row 1, etc. With this ordering,
the values within a row can be computed entirely in parallel, because each
\(M(i, j)\) only depends on three values \(M(i-1, \ldots)\) from the previous row.</p>

<p>However, there’s a major problem in practice with row-major order:
typical images are only at most a few thousand pixels wide, and each pixel
only requires a small amount of work. That’s not enough work (per row)
to parallelize effectively! We’ll need a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29">granularity</a>
of at least, say, a thousand pixels to amortize the cost of parallelism itself.</p>

<p>This pretty much rules out using row-major order for typical, small images.
Is there a better to compute \(M\) without reducing the grain size?</p>



<p>To extract more parallelism without reducing the grain size, we need a
better way to partition up the work. This is something that probably
<em>could</em> be done “automatically” (e.g. take a look at
<a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/c/Chowdhury:Rezaul_Alam.html">Rezaul Chowdhury</a>’s
work), but here we’ll just try to design something ourselves.</p>

<p>What are all of the dependencies for a single value \(M(i,j)\)? Visually,
the dependencies form a triangle with the pointy-end pointing down:</p>

<p><img width="300px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/depend.svg"></p>

<p>We can use triangles like these to split up the work in a nice way. First,
imagine grouping adjacent rows into <strong><em>strips</em></strong>. Within one strip,
cover the top of the strip with a bunch downward-pointing triangles. The
leftover space will look like a bunch of upward-pointing triangles, each
of which has all of its dependencies already satisfied (this is not immediately
obvious but drawing a picture will help). So, we
can process one strip in two parallel rounds, where first we do a bunch of
downward-pointing triangles in parallel, and then we do a bunch of
upward-pointing triangles to fill in the leftover space.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture using triangles that are 6 pixels wide at the base. Note that
if we use triangles of even base-width, then these tile naturally with no
overlap.</p>

<p><img width="350px" src="https://shwestrick.github.io/assets/seam-carve/strips.svg"></p>

<p>How wide should each triangle be in practice? Recall that we’re shooting for a
target granularity of maybe one or two thousand pixels. This corresponds to
triangles with base-widths of somewhere between 64 (1056 pixels in the triangle)
and 90 (2070 pixels in the triangle).</p>

<p>So, in a smallish image, e.g. 1000 pixels wide, we can fit
at least 11 triangles horizontally, suggesting a maximum possible
speedup of 11x or more. This is a big improvement over the row-major strategy,
which (using a granularity of 1000 pixels) would not be able to extract any
parallelism from such an image.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-and-performance">Implementation and performance</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a>, I implemented both the row-major
and triangular strategies to compare their performance. The code for the
triangular strategy is available in the <code>examples/src/seam-carve/</code> subdirectory
of the <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a> repo. I’ll leave the row-major
code as an exercise to the reader. (It’s not too bad!)</p>

<p>Here are some performance numbers for
removing 10 seams from an image of size approximately 2600x600. I did a little
bit of tuning, and ended up choosing a row-major granularity of 1000 pixels,
and a triangular base-width granularity of 88 (1980 pixels).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Strategy</th>
      <th>P = 1</th>
      <th>P = 10</th>
      <th>P = 20</th>
      <th>P = 30</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>row-major</td>
      <td>0.66</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
      <td>0.38</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>triangular</td>
      <td>0.78</td>
      <td>0.17</td>
      <td>0.12</td>
      <td>0.09</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On 1 processor (P = 1), the row-major strategy is faster by about 15%, but
on more processors quickly hits a maximum speedup of about 2x, seeing no
additional improvement above 10 processors.
In contrast, the triangular strategy continues to get faster as the number
of processors increases, with self-speedups of about 5x on 10 processors,
6.5x on 20, and 9x on 30.</p>

<p>Despite having a mild amount of overhead on 1 processor, we can see that
the triangular strategy provides significant gains. On higher core counts,
it is as much as 4x faster than the row-major strategy.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>One might wonder: why are the speedups we got so far away from theoretical
limits? With a base-width of 88, shouldn’t we be able to get up to 30x speedup
on an image of width 2600? Well, unfortunately, there are a large number of
barriers to achieving such good speedup in practice: ineffective cache
utilization, memory bandwidth bottlenecks, non-optimal scheduling… and
many more.</p>

<p>In the case of seam carving, there are two major limiting factors.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seam carving is largely memory-bound, i.e., for each memory access it
  only does a small amount of work before the next access. To get around this
  bottleneck, we might need better cache utilization, and so we would have to
  more carefully lay out the values of \(M(i,j)\) in memory. (For this
  implementation, I used a simple flat-array layout, where \(M(i,j)\) lives at
  index \(iW + j\). We could instead try storing these values in a
  hierarchical structure, indexing first by strip, and then by triangle, to
  better improve locality.)</li>
  <li>Seam carving has high span, performing a small amount of work in
  between each synchronization. For example in the row-major strategy, we use
  a barrier between each row, and in the triangular strategy, we use two
  barriers per strip. This can cause the scheduler to perform too many thread
  migrations. To mitigate this, one thing we could try is to let triangles
  overlap slightly, to increase the size of each strip. This trades a small
  amount of duplicated work for fewer barrier synchronizations overall, which
  could prove to be hugely beneficial.</li>
</ol>

<p>The village hall in Bowerchalke is an unlikely setting for a mobile technology revolution. Yet local residents, surrounded by crocheted goods and local jams, have spent three years forging a mobile phone network to bridge their own “digital divide”. </p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 


<p>The experimental Ch4lke Mobile, which runs over just five masts, can connect homes to a network capable of delivering broadband-like speeds, in an area that had been left behind by the digital revolution.</p>
<p>The fledgling network has just secured part of a £2.25m government grant to fill in England’s largest “not-spot” — an area with no mobile signal — and could offer a solution to other pockets in the country blighted by a lack of coverage.</p>
<p>The village sits in the picturesque Chalke valley in Wiltshire little more than 10 miles south of the world-famous Stonehenge. It is known for its high quality watercress and a number of celebrity residents, including film director Guy Ritchie and TV presenter <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c72387ca-31aa-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2" data-trackable="link">James May</a>. </p>
<p>But perhaps more fortunately for its inhabitants, the village also boasts a small group of residents with technology backgrounds. </p>
<p>Ed Gairdner, who used to work with tech start ups in Silicon Valley, moved to the Chalke Valley from Hampshire four years ago and became frustrated at the paucity of coverage. “We looked at the coverage maps in Carphone Warehouse before buying phones. We tried to do our due diligence — but there is no coverage here,” he said.</p>

<p>According to tests performed by network measurement company GWS signals are weak to non-existent in the valley. There is even a divide within the ‘digital divide’ as some residents with houses high on the downs get a signal while others have no coverage at all. “It became a non-discussion subject in the pub as it would start too many arguments,” said James Body, chair of the parish council.</p>
<p>Mr Body was unusually well placed when villagers began to complain to him about the lack of coverage. As a former officer in the British army’s Royal Signals, he spent a career in the military building networks and then went on to work in telecoms in the private sector.</p>
<p>Bowerchalke lies just a few miles west of the cathedral city of Salisbury, which now has one of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdf430ba-499f-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441" data-trackable="link">fastest broadband networks in the country</a>. But the steep, narrow Chalke valley has cut it off from the wireless revolution after an earlier government project failed to deliver five large mobile towers.</p>
<p>Despite few wanting the giant metallic structures, locals were angry at having no coverage. For Sue Lee, who runs a B&amp;B next to the village hall, the lack of connectivity has cost her business.</p>
<p>She describes various visitors abruptly leaving without paying after finding there was no mobile reception. She decided to harangue Mr Body. “Isn’t there anything we can do? It is ridiculous,” she recalled asking him. </p>
<p>Since then, Mr Body has spent three years working with the community to develop a test network that operates off small antennas attached to the chimneys of thatched cottages.</p>
<p>Inspired by an earlier initiative to set up a rural broadband network in Lancashire in north-west England called <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/32f013fc-91e1-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271" data-trackable="link">B4rn</a>, the new mobile network relies on the willingness of the community to solve the problem themselves rather than wait for the government or the industry to sort it out.</p>
<p>This also helps to lower costs as there is no rental or paperwork. The small base stations, that house the antennas, are also less of an eyesore than a mobile tower. The company compares its array of small cells to fairy lights reaching “every nook and cranny” of the valley. </p>

<p>The government funding for Ch4lke will allow the network to move from the experimental phase — where it is still encountering gremlins such as the text messages it occasionally spits out welcoming people to Jersey — to a fully fledged system capable of delivering 5G speeds.</p>
<p>The small base stations are put up by the local TV installer: Mr Body’s house and the village hall already have one and with the funding in place the aim is to build the network out with about 50 across the valley.</p>
<p>The tiny network is pioneering with its use of a so-called neutral host network, which taps into unused spectrum — the frequencies that carry mobile signals — to interconnect with the large UK players — Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three.</p>
<p>Ch4lke Mobile, which is community owned, is using British-made hardware and software from a small Cambridge company called CellXica. The company is also working with O2 on a small trial at a Surrey train station but believes the ingenuity of the rural solution shows that British technology can play a bigger role in a UK market set to phase out radio equipment from China’s Huawei, the largest supplier.</p>

<p>Ch4lke could offer a solution for other communities affected by not-spots in areas that the government-backed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd83abc8-f70c-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654" data-trackable="link">Shared Rural Network</a> programme, launched earlier this year to fill in most of the rural areas with poor coverage, won’t reach. “I’d love to have our radios in every not spot in the country now we have proved this is working,” said Ant Timpson of CellXica.</p>
<p>However getting the large telecoms on-side remains a key part of the process. The government backing for this scheme will help its cause. For John Glen, the local MP, the initiative is an example of a community banding together finding a solution to a debilitating problem where the government and industry has failed. </p>
<p>“You need to think laterally. You can’t conceive of this in Whitehall,” he said, sitting in the village hall. “This will be transformative for social cohesion. Everyone needs to benefit from the B&amp;B owner to the tech entrepreneur to the 85 year old,” he said.</p>

<p><em>Update: this generated a pretty good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24109726">Hacker News discussion</a>.</em></p>



<p>Does your company have a wiki? If you had to guess, what percentage of that wiki would you say is:</p>



<ul><li>Up to date</li><li>Still relevant</li><li>Viewed at least once per year by someone</li></ul>



<p>I’m going to take a wild guess that your answer is somewhere below 25%. If so, you’re saying that over 75% of your company’s wiki is either irrelevant, unused, or downright incorrect. In other words, the vast majority of your company’s wiki is at best not useful, and is at worst actively harmful if it’s giving people incorrect information. </p>



<p>This is called Wiki Rot. It’s spreading in companies worldwide, and it must be stopped. </p>



<p>What if you had to start over? What if, once a year, everything in your company’s wiki was deleted? Call it Wiki Bankruptcy. Here’s how it could go down:</p>



<ol><li>Tell everyone at your company that in 2 weeks, all wiki contents will be deleted. Let everyone take those 2 weeks to copy/back up/download any pages they want to keep.</li><li>After those 2 weeks end, you back up and delete everything in the wiki.</li><li>Tell everyone that they can now resume creating wiki pages, and are free to recreate the pages they thought were important.</li><li>For all of the people who realize they need stuff that they didn’t think about copying in step 1, allow them to access it from your back up from step 2. But do not allow linking directly to pages in that back up, or else you run the risk of people just continuing to read the backed up wiki pages.</li><li>Repeat after 1 year.</li></ol>



<p>Yes, it’s a huge pain, and there will be a couple weeks where everyone is grumpy about it. But Wiki Bankruptcy is the price we must pay to kill Wiki Rot. Wiki Bankruptcy ensures that the vast majority of your wiki will be up to date and relevant, and it’s a sure-fire way to clear out all the cruft nobody is ever looking at anymore.</p>



<p>Now, let’s hear all the reasons why you hate it. <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me about it</a>!</p>

The standard advice is to take an iterative approach, prioritising things and then cycling quickly through them, finding solutions just good enough to move things forwards before moving onto the next thing.</p><p data-reactid="45">It's good advice, but hard to follow in practice. Often when you explore solutions to a problem, even simple ones, the problem reveals itself to be more complex than you'd anticipated. You find sub-problems, and tangental problems, which look just as important as the original. It's easy to go off track and end up deep into the problem you were supposed to just find a quick solution to. After all, it's just one more thing, you're thinking about it, and you'll have to solve it at some point anyway. Why not now?</p><p data-reactid="46">I've made this mistake a lot. I'm trying to get better at being strict about saying "not now" to new problems that I discover in the middle of an iteration, and avoid getting sidetracked from shipping by working on things that can be left for later. I'd like to share a tactic I use to do this that has worked well for me. It's to ask a simple question about each new problem I encounter: "From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have?". If yes, I skip it. If no, I work on it immediately.</p><p data-reactid="48">An example to illustrate is signup functionality. Let's say I'm starting on a new product. Without signup, there's no possibility of getting any users, which is a problem. From my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? No - I have zero users right now, and can't get any until signup is done. The only way to move forwards is to build signup.</p><p data-reactid="49">Whilst I'm building signup, I realise that I probably also need reset password functionality. If a user signs up, but then forgets their password, that's a problem. But from my perspective right now, is this a nice problem to have? Actually, yes! I have zero users, but having this problem implies I would have users, which would be great. Reset password functionality is important, and will absolutely be required eventually, but I can do it later. First, I should ship anything that's stopping me from getting users in the first place.</p><p data-reactid="51">There are always tiers of functionality which build upon one another, and this simple question provides a neat hack to sort things in order of when they'll actually be useful so you can build and ship that functionality in faster iterations, rather than delaying shipping while you batch and build everything up front. Try it out when you next build something.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

      <p>Short answer: because we said so.<!--more--></p>

<p>:)</p>



<p>Alright, fine, that’s too short to make it an article, dear reader, and my inflammatory words demand an explanation.</p>

<p>The C Committee meeting – originally scheduled for Freiburg, Germany but not happening there because <em>(* vague gesturing towards outside *)</em> – concluded Friday, August 7th. It went pretty well, with us making good progress on all fronts. Yes, we make real progress; I promise we do, and this is not a dead language.</p>

<p>As a side note I’ve also become the Project Editor for C so before you take this as an uninformed rant of a person too lazy to “make things better”, let me assure that I am, indeed, incredibly invested in making sure C can begin to meet the needs of developers without needing 50 vendor-specific extensions to build remotely nice/usable libraries and applications.</p>

<p>Still, I made a claim (the C Language will never stop you from making mistakes), and therefore I need to substantiate it. We could look at the thousands of CVEs and the inherent issues with tons of C Code, or the need for MISRA to vigorously police every last little potential C feature to prevent misuse (<a href="https://twitter.com/thephantomderp/status/1290824683399663616">hello, K&amp;R prototype declarations</a>…), or other more intricate and fun bugs related to portability and undefined behavior. But instead, we are just going to take the words from the horse’s mouth: the Committee itself.</p>



<p>No, dear reader, put the popcorn away. As with all ISO proceedings, I am not allowed to quote anyone verbatim, and this is not a name-and-shame article. It will, however, explain why things that we can easily diagnose and identify as bad behavior in standards-conforming ISO C will never go away. And we will start with a paper by Dr. Philipp Klaus Krause:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2526.htm">N2526, use const for data from the library that shall not be modified</a>.</p>

<p>N2526 is a very simple paper. “Some data returned by the library is <code>const</code> morally, spiritually, and in fact even by its implementation. It’s undefined behavior and wrong to write into it, so let’s stop teasing each other about it and put a ring on that finger bad boy!” … Okay, that’s not exactly what it says, but I’m sure the idea makes sense to you, dear reader. Originally, when the vote for this paper was taken, there was almost no votes against the paper. Then, a few people voiced their <em>strong</em> objections to the paper because it breaks old code. And, well, of course that’s bad: even my breath caught and I strained to think about this – adding <code>const</code>? C has no ABI that could be affected by this, C (their implementations) doesn’t even respect qualifiers, how are we breaking things?! So, let’s talk about why this would be a breaking change in the eyes of certain folk.</p>



<p>Or, as I like to call it, “The Type Safety Is For Losers Language”. Of course, that’s a mouthful, so “C” will have to do. You may be wondering why I would call a language like C as having no type safety. After all,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Meow</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<p>
Yes, two entirely unrelated pointer types can be set to one another in standards-conforming C. Most compilers warn, but it is standards-conforming to accept this code unless you crank up the <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>In fact, other pointer-related things the compiler can accept without an explicit cast are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>volatile</code> (who needs those semantics anyways?!)</li>
  <li><code>const</code> (write into all the read-only data you like!)</li>
  <li><code>_Atomic</code> (thread safety, shred shmafety!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, note I am not arguing that you should not be able to do these things at all. But when you’re working in C – wherein it is very easy to get yourself a 500, 1000-line function alongside variable names that do not describe WTF they are for – the Hard Facts™ is that you work primarily with pointers, and you lack any amount of safety at all insofar as the Core Language cares. (NOTE: It <strong>is</strong> a constraint violation, but there’s so much legacy code that every implementation ignores qualifiers anyhow, so your code won’t ever <em>stop</em> compiling because of this (<a href="https://twitter.com/fanf/status/1292826424345337868">thanks, @fanf!</a>)!) Every potential failure here is diagnosable – easily so – with a compiler, and they all warn, but they will never require you to cast to communicate to the compiler that you Seriously, Really Meant It. It also means – much more importantly – that the human beings who come after you will have no bloody idea if you meant to do this, either.</p>

<p>All someone has to do is strip the build of <code>-Werror</code> <code>-Wall</code> <code>-Wpedantic</code> and you’ll be off to the races in committing multithreading, read-only, and hardware register crimes.</p>

<p>Now, this is fair, right? If someone strips off all of these warning/error flags, they obviously do not care about whatever faux pas or silly gaffe you’ve committed. Which means that, at the end of the day, these warnings are ultimately irrelevant and harmless as far as standards-conforming, ISO C is concerned. And yet…</p>



<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is a special kind of hell that C developers have grown comfortable with, and to a lesser extent C++ developers. Warnings are seen as annoyances; and, as is shown by ever turning on <code>-Weverything</code> or <code>/W4</code>, they very well are. Shadowing warnings from variables in the global namespace (thanks, every header and C library ever is now a problem), using “reserved” names (as the kids say, “<a href="https://wg14.link/n2493">lol nice one xd!!</a>”), and “this struct has padding because you used <code>alignof</code>” (… yes, yes I know it has padding, I explicitly asked it to increase my padding BECAUSE I USED <code>alignof</code> MR. COMPILER) are all incredibly time-wasting.</p>

<p>But they are warnings.</p>

<p>Even if they are annoying, they prevent problems. The fact that I can blithely <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/rEbPvd">ignore all qualifiers and dumpster all forms of read, write, thread, and read-only safety</a> is a serious issue when it comes to communicating intent and preventing bugs. Even the old K&amp;R syntax produced bugs in industrial and government codebases because users did the wrong thing. This is not because they are shit programmers: it’s because they are straddling codebases sometimes older than they are and gearing up to ride on a multi-million line technical liability. You cannot keep the entirety of the codebase in your head: this is what conventions, static analysis, high warning levels, and everything are supposed to combat. Unfortunately,</p>

<p>everyone likes to have Warning Free code.</p>

<p>This means that the moment a GCC developer makes a warning more sensitive to potential problematic cases, maintainers (not the original developers) will suddenly get hefty several-gigabyte logs containing all the newest vomit of warnings and other things from their old code. “This is stupid”, they say, “the code has been running for Y E A R S, why is GCC complaining now?”. This means that even doing something like adding <code>const</code> to a function signature, even if it is morally, spiritually, and factually the right thing to do, is avoided. “Breaking” people is “they now have to look at code which has questionable intentions”. This is code that would – on pain of Undefined Behavior – crash your chip or <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareMinigun/status/1260061878614556684">corrupt your memory</a>. But that’s the other problem with being a C developer in today’s ecosystem, really.</p>

<h3 id="age-as-a-measure-of-quality">Age as a Measure of Quality</h3>

<p>How many people would have ever guessed <code>sudo</code> had a vulnerability as jaw-droppingly simple as “-1 or integer overflow gives you access to everything”? How many people thought Heartbleed would be a real problem? How many game developers are shipping stb’s “tiny” libraries without ever having run a fuzzer on them and realizing they contain more significant exploitable input vulnerabilities than they could imagine? This is not a dig at any of these pieces of code or the programmers behind them: they are providing a vital service that the world has depended on for decades, often with little to no support from anyone until a big problem exploded. But, the people worshipping and deploying these pieces of code end up fermenting a toxic adage under the auspice of survivorship bias:</p>

<p>“This code is so old and used by so many, how could it possibly have problems?”</p>

<p>By holding backwards compatibility and “not being a bother” as the highest ideals for C code, people who survive long enough in the industry begin to equate age with quality, as if codebases were barrels of wine in a cellar. The older and longer the code is used, the finer and more delectable the wine.</p>

<p>The reality is, unfortunately, far less romantic and cute: crawling with more bugs than you can shake a stick at, security vulnerabilities by the basketful, these technical liabilities only grow more risky with each passing day. Each system evolves into a half-alive, unaddressed, and partially-unmaintained rotting husk. They are gussied up and given the veneer of nobility and greatness when it is in fact an embalmed corpse, just waiting to be poked the wrong way before its festering, antediluvian pustules burst and fill your application with its finely aged botulism.</p>

<p>The problem I have noticed in my (incredibly short) tenure as a member is that we prefer backwards compatibility over all else, attributing old applications and their use cases over any chance at improving the safety, …</p></section></div>

                 <p>I've taken my Static Single Page Application to the next logical stopping point. Should I write a complete chess engine? How important is it to know when to stop coding? Here's a video walk-thru of the reasons for and design of the application.</p>
<p>Note: Dropbox was not working on my studio laptop, so the page I am demo'ing is actually a very old one. This is why a few errors come up during the demo. The repo master branch does not have these errors.</p>            </div>

                 <p>Toolin' Up Thursdays: Physical Videos</p>
<p>I love movies. I also love <em>my</em> movies, my physical little boxes full of digital creations that I enjoy watching.</p>
<p>You should consider a physical video library.</p>
<p>In many ways, this echoes the debate over whether to use physical books or eBooks. I love both, but I think each experience is completely different from the other one. For me, I'd never consider buying a technical or long-form fiction book that wasn't physical. I enjoy carrying them around, I enjoy flipping back and forth to compare and lookup passages, and I enjoy being a librarian and home entertainment curator.</p>
<p>Those are also the kinds of things I enjoy with a physical movie library. I can browse, thinking over each title. I might pull one out, look at the back, and think: is this good enough for the evening's entertainment? Or is it a bit too dark to go with that other selection. I can make a temporary stack of movies to judge, show them to the family. I can read liners while...</p>            </div>

                 <p>Wayback Wednesdays: Richelieu</p>
<p>On this day in 1624, Cardinal Armand Jean du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu (known simply as "Richelieu" ) was made president of the council of ministers of France</p>
<p>When I say "France", I mean something as we know it today, but back then it was anything but a country. There were severe internal differences, each little fiefdom had it's own lord, and national control was a rare if non-existent thing. The old joke is that the phrase "Holy Roman Empire" was wrong on all counts: It wasn't holy, it wasn't Roman, and it wasn't an Empire.</p>
<p>After the Western Roman Empire slowly disintegrated into little kingdoms, the people in the west still thought of themselves as Romans. Why wouldn't they? In fact, if you look at some very modern terms for leader, like "Tsar" and "Keiser", they're just different ways of saying Caesar.</p>
<p>But a disintegrated Western Europe was inherently unstable, no matter what they though they were. Add in the printing press and the ...</p>            </div>

                 <p>Theory Tuesdays: The MAT</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I created the Markham Assessment Tool (MAT). The idea wasn't to implement processes, or make some new "maturity scale" for organizations to use to monitor and punish teams. Instead, every team, even the most successful ones, had things they should probably talk about but had been putting it off (or never realized it) The MAT was an effort to provide a standard language to begin conversations no matter how big or what the nature of the team was.</p>
<p>The first job was finding a detailed enough language to try to pinpoint where the conversations should happen. The default was a combination of the RUP and the CMMI's "common obstacles to process improvement" (Once again, this tool had nothing to do with process; it was just about creating a standard language that could be used by coaches across teams) Other combinations were used as well during field testing.</p>            </div>

<h3>Department of State Emergency Relocation Site and Communications Station, Front Royal, VA (demolished)</h3>
<p>These facilities were located at what is now the Smithsonian Institution's Conservation and Research Center.
According to the Center's <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/CRC/FrontRoyal/about_us/CRC_history/"> official history</a>:</p>
<p>"In addition to the USDA functions, the Department of State used a portion of the Center's facilities as an Emergency Relocation site and a communications station.
The State Department equipped several buildings as offices in case of national emergency--enough for the Secretary and 700 State Department employees.
By 1972, all that was left of this activity was the communication station.
In the winter of 1973, USDA decided to close down the Research Station's operations."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Content sites are great, low barrier to entry businesses that (when done right) can generate a sustainable source of cash. </p><p>Not only that, but they’re also fun. Using the method I’m going to outline below, you can pick a topic that really interests you — learn more about it — and make money in the process.</p><p>I started two of my own content sites a few years ago. They were my first foray into internet businesses and affiliate marketing. When I started the first one (about running — Let’s Go Run), I had no idea what I was doing, and no money to do it. </p><p>I scrounged around the internet finding resources about SEO, keyword planning and blogging. I went through about three SemRush trial’s (sorry SemRush!) with different emails trying to come up with a keyword plan, and figure out why the hell my blog posts weren’t coming up on Google! Then, after about 4 months of working on it and putting out content religiously, I started ranking for one of my main keywords. </p><p>I made it to the front page of Google! I’ll never forget the excitement.</p><p>That got me hooked. I spent the next few years growing out that site, and creating another one with my mom (who loves golf). </p><p>I got them to the small-medium level (each had traffic of about 10k monthly visits) and then sold them online. I needed the cash to start what I thought was a ‘real’ business. </p><p>The thing is, I sold them way before I had monetized each of them properly. I just didn’t know what I was doing! And the buyer knew it. All the income was from affiliate earnings, and they were running off the same account (so I don’t have specific figures for each website), earning around about $80 to $100 mark per month combined.</p><p>Knowing what I do now about niche content sites, and their ability to generate a sustainable cash flow, I would have never sold those sites. </p><p>This is my approach to building content sites that are monetized effectively, and how you can too.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>What Are They?</h3><p>A niche content site is just a website where people wanting to know about something in a certain niche go to find that out.</p><p>If you take any subreddit, and create content specifically tailored to that audience, it would be a niche content site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52457e66346b8d05835d_0*gL3fHRm-e86x0tgu.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Swim University is the perfect example of a niche site: Everything you need to know about keeping a pool clean.</p><h3>How Do They Work?</h3><p>The fundamentals of it are as follows:</p><ol role="list"><li>Pick a specific niche.</li><li>Create content around that niche, and post it on the website.</li><li>Drive readers to that website.</li><li>Build an audience of readers.</li><li>Monetize that audience.</li></ol><h3>A Modified Approach</h3><p>The approach I’m going to give you here uses the framework above, but modifies the Monetization step slightly.</p><p>The goal is simple: <strong>Get to revenue as fast as possible.</strong></p><p>We’ll go into monetization further below, but the gist of it is this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Traditional niche site model requires a ton of traffic to make decent money (especially today).</li><li>My model requires a few thousand views a month with high intent and in a specific niche.</li></ul><h3>Examples</h3><p><strong>SwimUniversity.com</strong> (above) — Pool care</p><p><strong>GearLab.com</strong> — Outdoor gear reviews</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524647ea4173bd1d6c06_0*d8YHEXfmp62TptgH.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>ApartmentTherapy.com — </strong>Kit out and care for your trendy apartment</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a524669ed957a4dbc995f_0*9KPXKzA3bD2Qt04E.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Fatherly.com</strong> — A site for dad’s</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a5245e566339d3104c7a4_0*kZ2EoL3V_m9I3aZ7.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Before you continue, understand your motivation for wanting to do this.</p><p>Here’s mine: <strong>Cash</strong>. Niche sites are great cash generators if you can get them right. As long as you have a steady flow of traffic, they can bring in a (mostly) reliable income every single month.</p><p>For me, that means not having to worry about rent as an expense.</p><p>For you, it might mean an additional income to fund your startup.</p><p>Get clear on your motivation to do this so that when things aren’t going so well, you know whether to knuckle down and commit, or bail out because it’s taking too much time and energy to achieve what you want.</p><p>These aren’t sexy businesses, but they work if you do ’em right.</p><h2>🚵 Pick A Niche</h2><p><strong>And validate it, too.</strong></p><p>This is my unconventional advice: <strong>Start with your interests</strong>.</p><p>The thesis behind that is: If you’re not interested in it, you’re not going to want to create content about it.</p><p>One thing I do know is that for this to be successful you have to commit to creating enough content.</p><p>There are a few things you need to consider when picking a niche, though.</p><h3><strong>Audience size</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>You need a big enough audience to make this viable. <em>Golf</em> = too broad and too competitive. <em>Left-Handed Blind Golfers</em> = too niche. You get the point.</li><li>I would define niche as SwimUniversity.com (above).</li><li>I would define micro-niche as SwimUniversity.com but for glass fibre pools only.</li><li>As a guide — though this is very dependent on your audience and monetization method — your monthly search volume shouldn’t be lower than 30k visits (or 1k visitors a day).</li></ul><h3><strong>Can you monetize it?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Does this audience typically spend money on this interest? Either directly or indirectly. If yes, then the answer will almost always be continue.</li></ul><p>or…</p><ul role="list"><li>Can you generate a ton of search traffic (100k monthly +), which you’d be able to monetize through Display Ads? This would require large search volume for your search keywords, as well as low domain authority for the competing sites. This is generally only available in completely unexplored niches (of which there are very few around).</li></ul><h3><strong>How does that audience consume most of their content?</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>And can you create that content. If your niche consumes mainly blog posts, great. Low barrier. If they mostly consume well produced video content, and you have no experience doing that = bit higher barrier.</li></ul><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Write down all your interests, and then some. Aim for 50 ideas.</li><li>Rank them in order of how ‘niche’ they are. Ie: How many other people are there who share this interest in the world.</li><li>Then rank them in order of your interest in each of them.</li><li>Choose the top 5 combined ranking.</li><li>Sign up for a keyword volume research tool (Most of them offer free trials). I use <a href="https://app.kwfinder.com/#a5dca93d6feebf8609c185b05" target="_blank">Mangools</a>. It’s a lot cheaper (and a bit less powerful) than <a href="https://www.semrush.com/lp/all-in-one-marketing-toolkit/en/?ref=3487429516&amp;refer_source=15-business-ideas-blog-post&amp;utm_source=berush&amp;utm_medium=promo&amp;utm_campaign=link_landing_page:_all-in-one_marketing_toolkit" target="_blank">SEMrush </a>or Ahrefs, but it suits my needs perfectly.</li><li>Do a search for your topic and start collating and creating keywords with monthly search volume &gt; 500 and keyword difficulty &lt; 30. Go after long-tail keywords if you can’t find any.</li><li>If you’re new to this, I haven’t found a better resource than <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/keyword-research/?ref=SimonBlogs" target="_blank">Neil Patel’s guide to keyword research.</a></li><li>When you’re done, you should have a good idea of the amount of monthly traffic you can generate (remember, you’re going to have to rank on the first page for those search terms to get a <em>portion </em>of that traffic!).</li><li>Giving hard and fast rules about traffic volume and keyword difficulty targets is difficult.</li><li>Andrew Boscini put it well to me on Twitter the other day:</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5f2a52453067ff4556a6074b_1*hPVtmGrOkuYQX1g7uGPTmQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you going for a ton of traffic that converts in the low % range, or are you going more niche, with very high search intent?</p><p>I’d also recommend snooping around the following forums/places to get a sense for the community you’re diving into and what the pain points are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit </strong>(Find all the applicable sub-reddits)</li><li><strong>Quora </strong>(What questions are people asking)</li><li><strong>Websites</strong>/<strong>Forums </strong>(Who are you competing with)</li><li><strong>Wikipedia </strong>(What information can I give on this niche)</li><li><strong>Twitter </strong>(Do a search and see who the top authorities in the space are)</li><li><strong>Facebook Groups </strong>(How many are they, are they engaged or spammy?)</li></ul><p>As you pick up on areas of discussion, do a search for them as they relate to your niche in the keyword finder and add all those keywords to your list too.</p><h2>✍🏽 Content</h2><p>That’s the fun part done.</p><p>Now that you’ve got your keyword list defined, you need to start writing content. Religiously.</p><p>This is where most people fail on niche sites. They write a few (maybe 5 or 6) articles, and then they get bored and move on. That’s why I said earlier you need to pick a niche that you’re interested in.</p><p>As a guideline, you’re likely going to need to write 100-odd pieces of content in a year.</p><p>If you think that’s unachievable in the niche you’ve selected (because you’ll get bored or otherwise) you have two choices:</p><ol role="list"><li>Go back to the step above and choose a different niche that you’re going to be interested enough in.</li><li>Hire writers (money required).</li></ol><h3>Do This Now</h3><ol role="list"><li>Once you’ve decided on your niche, start writing. Open a Google Doc and begin on your first piece of content. Aim to put out 2 or 3 pieces for 3 or 4 days back to back.</li><li>You should be going after your most valuable keyword’s (high search, low keyword difficulty) first.</li><li>After 3 or 4 days, you’ll have a good idea for the tone/style of your content and you’ll be better positioned to register a domain and setup a home for your content.</li><li>Try and follow the theme of the example domains I showed above. Preferably including one of the main keywords which describes your niche in the url.</li><li>Don’t get hung up if the ideal .com domain isn’t available. There are other options:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Your country’s domain extension (only do this if you’re looking to only attract an audience in your own country)</li><li>.co is a great option</li><li>.io is well recognized in the tech-space</li></ul><p>Your domain name is not the be-all and end-all. A nice one is nice to have, but it’s not essential.</p><p>6. Without a doubt, Wordpress is the best option for a quick and easy setup.</p><p>Your domain/hosting provider will likely have some sort of installer for Wordpress available in the backend (Softaculous, usually) which will do it for you.</p><p>7. Install a theme. I get mine from <a href="https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress/blog?u=simonpurdon10" target="_blank">Creative Market.</a></p><p>Again, don’t get hung up on the details. You’ll be surprised by how little people care about the nitty-gritty things that seem to be a big deal to the website-owner.</p><p>If your site works well, looks reasonably good, loads quickly, with great content — that’ll do.</p><p>8. Post your content. Add images. Add external links (more on this later).</p><p>9. Add a method of collecting email addresses! Don’t just have a generic “Join our newsletter” either. No one wants to join just another newsletter.</p><p>Give your readers an actual incentive for signing up: “Join our newsletter for exclusive access to subscriber-only content”.</p><p>10. Remember to install:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO plugin</a> (for on-site SEO help)</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Facebook Pixel</li></ul><h2>🖱️ Traffic</h2><p>Now for the most important (but also the most tedious, for me) part: <strong>Driving traffic.</strong></p><p>Putting up content and hoping …</p></div></div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The American technology giant
Apple has taken legal action against a small company called Prepear, which is
an application and service that makes it easier for people to plan their meals
and find new recipes. The cause of action: Prepear chose to use a pear-shaped
fruit as its logo, which is too similar to Apple's logo, according to a message
posted on Instagram by the company's founders. The message describes Apple's
action as "a blow to Prepear," and indicates the intention to keep
the original logo and "send a message to large technology companies that
intimidation of small businesses has consequences.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business’ trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business. I’m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences. HOW YOU CAN HELP: 1 Sign the petition (link in my bio or in my stories) 2 Share that same link on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. http://chng.it/QPd2mRYW #savethepearfromapple</a></p></div>

<span lang="EN-US">The Prepear company has been in
existence for 5 years. It is an application that allows users to store all
their recipes in one place, plan their meals, make shopping lists and have
their groceries delivered to the same place. The application is a derivative of
Super Healthy Kids, which offers recipes and feeding strategies and shares tips
and organizational tools for parents. The founders say they are facing
litigation from Apple. Apple is said to disagree with the Prepear logo, arguing
that its attributes are too similar to its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

recipe management and meal planning,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> wrote the founders
of Prepear in a post on Instagram asking for help. Prepear is a small company
with only five employees, and the founders say legal fees have already cost
them "several thousand dollars", plus the dismissal of one team
member, in their legal battle against the iPhone manufacturer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear also points out that
before "<i>attacking us, Apple opposed dozens of other trademark
applications filed by small companies with fruit-related logos.</i> According
to Prepear, many of these small companies have had to change their logos or
even give up and shut down, as the limited means of most of them did not allow
them to fight the iPhone manufacturer in a lawsuit costing tens of thousands of
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Sending a message
against the bullying of small businesses by the largest technology companies</span></span></b></h2>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear, Apple has
opposed small businesses with fruit-related logos by launching costly lawsuits,
even when these logos do not resemble the Apple logo at all or are not in the
same industry as Apple. <i>"We're defending ourselves against Apple not
only to keep our logo, but also to send a message to large technology companies
that intimidation of small businesses has consequences,"</i> said the
company's founders.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">The iPhone In Canada website says
it received, on Sunday, more details on the trademark application for the
pear-shaped logo of Prepear, a free application available for download on iOS
and Android. In an email sent to the website, chief operating officer Russ
Monson says Prepear has been registering its trademark for the logo since
January 2017 and that the U.S. trademark office finally told it "<i>that
it was not in conflict with other registered trademarks and that it would
publish it for opposition.<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">Everything seemed to
be coming to an end when, on the</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> "<i>last day of the
opposition period for the trademark, we were informed that Apple had requested
an extension of the opposition period, and then requested further extensions,
which placed our trademark in a legal limbo for a long period of time".<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<div>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">According to Prepear's email,
Apple filed its effective opposition on the last day it was legally entitled to
do so. According to Monson, the additional extensions filed resulted in
additional legal costs for the small company, and to him, these extensions
"seemed to have been designed by their legal team to be as long, difficult
and expensive as possible for us.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Monson goes on to explain that
Prepear was "naive enough" to think that they could discuss the issue
with Apple in a rational manner, as the two logos are different. But this was
not the case and the opposition has now reached the "discovery
phase", which, according to the COO, "will be the most expensive part
of this case for us". However, Prepear decided to move on to this phase at
Apple's request.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><i><span lang="EN-US">"We believe that
this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple's
position on this issue, Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than
let the public see how it is clearly hurting us for no apparent justifiable
reason,"</span></i><span lang="EN-US"> said Monson in his email to iPhone In Canada.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>
<b><span lang="EN-US"><span>Other companies have
already changed their logos as a result of Apple's lawsuits.</span></span></b></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some companies whose logos
(below) were attacked by Apple under the same conditions have given up. But the
founders of Prepear say they are lucky enough to attract enough media attention
"to expose this practice by Apple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Other logos have also been the
source of legal actions brought by Apple in the past, such as the case against
a Norwegian political party and a German bicycle path. The logo of the
political party in question depicts a red apple with a stem, a green leaf and
has the letter F in white on the front. Apple wrote a letter to the Norwegian
Patent and Trademark Office stating that this logo with a red apple looks like
its own logo.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

</div>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US">In 2009, Apple also attacked
Woolworths, an Australian supermarket chain, which had just changed its logo.
Woolworths insisted at the time that its logo is nothing more or less than a
stylized "W", but Apple claimed it was an apple and therefore asked
them to stop using it! Hans Hulsbosch, the creator of the logo, said at the
time that the protection of the Apple logo was "taken to extremes".
"Based on this logic, they should attack all fruit sellers.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
<span lang="EN-US"><br></span>
<span lang="EN-US"></span></p>
</div>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Prepear says they are not asking
for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone manufacturer to
"stop attacking small businesses in frivolous affairs that seem designed
to make them spend so much money and time thinking about the business instead
of focusing on how to grow business and ensure to survive the current economic
crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The petition on Change.org has
now received 20,000 signatures, and Prepear hopes that Apple will drop the case
before moving on to more costly discovery and trial phases. Otherwise, small
businesses should give up using fruit as a logo for their brand.<o:p></o:p></span><br>

<p>The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and
            “What’s wrong with SQL?”.  This post contains answers to both.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational
            model came to be, and how SQL was created.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql">
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL</h2>
<p>The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper
                “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” <span>[<a id="id1" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970">4</a>]</span>.
                There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in
                terms of sets of tuples, called <em>relations</em>. Codd also invented a form of
                first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: <em>tuple
                    relational calculus</em>.</p>
<p>Codd’s ideas were revolutionary.  For the first time, a database,
                and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent
                mathematical model.  This, naturally, created lots of interest in further
                research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational
                model.</p>
<p>In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper
                <span>[<a id="id2" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974">2</a>]</span>, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular
                structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”.
                Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed
                at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in
                mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of
                the language would be for ad-hoc queries” <span>[<a id="id3" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012">3</a>]</span>.  Initially,
                the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language.  Nonetheless,
                the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had
                pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by
                their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.</p>
<p>IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time,
                so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper
                standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that
                essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations
                of SQL.  Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily
                influenced by the commercial vendors.</p>
<p>Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language.  But that does
                not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do.
                In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with
                “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with
                a baggage of severe issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="critique-of-sql">

<p>SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts,
                including Codd himself <span>[<a id="id4" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span>, as well as C. J. Date, who published a
                multitude of papers and books on the subject (<span>[<a id="id5" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985">7</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id6" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>,
                <span>[<a id="id7" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009">10</a>]</span>).  While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later
                versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further
                ingrained.</p>
<p>Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific
                to a certain implementation.  We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the
                examples.</p>
<p>SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with
                        application languages and protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="lack-of-orthogonality">

<p>Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set
                    of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
                    A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is
                    easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of
                    rules.  Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many
                    exceptions and caveats.</p>
<p>A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to
                    substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function
                    call, without any effect on the final result.</p>
<p>In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are <em>two</em>
                    mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>table expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a table:
                            <code>SELECT * FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>scalar expression</em> is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value:
                            <code>SELECT count(*) FROM table</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table expressions can only be used in a <code>FROM</code> clause, in a function, or with
                    an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input.
                    What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax,
                    which can be a source of further confusion.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department
                    heads in a company.  This query would do the job:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> name
<span>FROM</span> emp
<span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span></span></span></pre>
<p>Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts
                    information about a department.  An intuitive way is to simply add the
                    above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> name <span>FROM</span> emp
     <span>WHERE</span> role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span> <span>AND</span> deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>This is legal, but <em>only</em> if the subquery returns not more than one row.
                    Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time.  To account for multiple
                    department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span>
    dept<span>.</span>name<span>,</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
    head<span>.</span>name
<span>FROM</span>
    dept
    <span>INNER</span> <span>JOIN</span> emp <span>AS</span> head
        <span>ON</span> <span>(</span>head<span>.</span>deptno <span>=</span> dept<span>.</span><span>no</span>
            <span>AND</span> head<span>.</span>role <span>=</span> <span>'dept head'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level
                    query reuse impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-compactness">

<div><p>Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality.
                        Some call it an elephant on clay feet.  With each addition, its body grows,
                        and it becomes less stable.  SQL standardization is largely the domain of
                        database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests

<p>SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL
                    implementation contains <b>469 keywords</b>. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the
                    SQL:2016 standard has <b>1732 pages</b>.</p>
<p>The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be
                    an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”.  However, with the
                    growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed <em>negatively</em> to the
                    ability to write and comprehend SQL queries.  We learnt this lesson with
                    COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct
                    programming languages.</p>
<p>In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed
                    above make queries more verbose and harder to read.</p>
</div>
<div id="lack-of-consistency">

<p>SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What
                    makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version
                    of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span> <span>from</span> <span>8</span> <span>for</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> substring<span>(</span><span>'PostgreSQL'</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>SELECT</span> trim<span>(</span>both <span>from</span> <span>'yxSQLxx'</span><span>,</span> <span>'xyz'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> extract<span>(</span><span>day</span> <span>from</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>'2001-02-16 20:38:40'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></span></pre>
<p>There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an
                    aggregate function:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> array_agg<span>(</span>foo <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><span><span>SELECT</span> rank<span>(</span>foo<span>)</span> <span>WITHIN</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> bar<span>)</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued,
                    but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<div><p>In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information,
                        the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the
                        relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies
                        of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. <span>[<a id="id9" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990">6</a>]</span></p><p>Edgar J. Codd</p></div>
<p>It has been extensively argued that <code>NULL</code> is the biggest misfeature of SQL
                    (<span>[<a id="id10" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987">5</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id11" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986">8</a>]</span>, <span>[<a id="id12" href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987">9</a>]</span>).
                    In fact, the handling of <code>NULL</code> in contemporary SQL implementations is so
                    surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate
                    section.</p>
<p><code>NULL</code> is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# select NULL = NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)</span></span></pre>
<p>In fact, almost any operation on <code>NULL</code> will return <code>NULL</code> and the
                    effect may be very subtle:</p>
<pre><span><span>postgres=# CREATE TABLE x (a int, b text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# INSERT INTO x(a, b)
           VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (NULL, 'three')
           RETURNING a, b;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
   | three
(3 rows)

postgres=# SELECT * FROM x WHERE a NOT IN (1, null);
 a | b
---+---
(0 rows)</span></span></pre>
<p>But, in some cases <code>NULL</code>
<em>is</em> equal to itself, such as in <code>DISTINCT</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span>elvis=# SELECT DISTINCT *
        FROM (VALUES (1), (NULL), (NULL)) AS q;
 column1
---------

       1
(2 rows)</span></span></pre>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>



<p>It has been brought to my attention that there was a mistake by an entry level employee. </p>



<p>So the Revenue Department itself was supposed to get all the NOCs required by going to all those offices, but an entry level employee forgot to add my file to the list of NA’s to be done.</p>



<p>So now I have been told that all the NOC’s will be taken care of by the Revenue Department, Collector Office. </p>



<p>If any legal fees need to be paid, I will be informed by the Collector office (without me requiring to go to every office) and everything will be done in less than 2 months.</p>



<p>I am thankful to everyone for sharing my experience far and wide. But now my experience stands cleared and so does this post. </p>



<p>A lot of people have helped reach this post to very very high-in-the-hierarchy people in the state and central government as well as major national political parties. I am really very thankful to everyone.</p>



<p>I will try again in a few months and keep surveying the experience of people who get their NA done. Thank you again for all the co-operation.</p>



<p>I am also writing a post about “the real process required to obtain the NA permission”. I will try to get the higher authorities from the Collector office to record a video stating the actual procedure required and will publish such article soon.</p>



<p>Again Thank You Very Much.</p>



<p>I have removed the original post. I will update with next steps soon. </p>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend Juan Paucar directed me to a paper from the magnificent <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030171834">Programming Languages and Systems
28th European Symposium on Programming, ESOP 2019</a>, related to Codata. I have been very interested in codata, mainly because it relates to data in a category-theory way, but, as usual, I didn't understand many of the words involved. This paper helped me understand a lot, and also helped me understand and shape my mind on how to connect the worlds of FP and OOP. But, before that, we must go on tour over a bit of theory.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Data, better understood as Haskell's <code>data</code> declaration, is nothing more than a type and a bunch of ways (functions) to create values of that type. I'm going to use the GADT syntax just because it makes the functions visible. Here is an example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the folks that don't grasp GADTs yet, the above is equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>Foo1</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Foo2</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But with the GADT syntax we can see the functions. <code>Foo1</code> is a constructor, but also a function. <code>Foo1</code> receives an Int and a String, and constructs a value of type <code>Foo</code>. Exactly the same happens with <code>Foo2</code>.</p>
<p>We just talked about constructors: a constructor is nothing more than a function that manufactures a value out of other values. But that pretty much defines every function as a constructor, which isn't helpful. We'll go a bit further: a constructor is a "primitive" function that makes a value of type T, and is not build out of other functions that make a value of type T. Also, a constructor is the function you define when you write a <code>data</code> declaration.</p>
<p>If there are constructors, there should be something that dismantles data, because data seems to be constructed by aggregating values. This thing that deconstructs data is called "eliminators". The universal eliminator in Haskell is the <code>case</code> statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>case</code> statement accepts a parameter (what you put between the <code>case</code> and the <code>of</code>) and returns a value of some type. That's why all the branches in a <code>case</code> statement must have the same type, because when you write a <code>case</code> statement, you are writing a function like <code>mycase :: Foo -&gt; X</code>, but with a nicer syntax.</p>
<p>This means eliminators are not always in the shape of <code>case</code> statements. In reality, eliminators are just functions, and Haskell provides special syntax for these functions to be written in a better way. But, if we go to Lisp, for example, we also have constructors and eliminators.</p>
<p>In Lisp you can manufacture a list with a new head by using the constructor <code>cons</code> (this is why these data structure is called a <code>cons-cell</code>). <code>cons</code> is just another function with two parameters: the head and the tail of the list to be constructed, and returns the list. To destructure a cons-list, you have two eliminators: <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>. <code>car</code> takes a list and returns the head, <code>cdr</code> takes the list and returns the tail.</p>
<p>Haskell also offers eliminators, but everyone frowns at you if you use them too much: when you declare a record datatype, Haskell helpfully creates functions to access each of the fields:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>=</span> <span>FooRecord</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fooField1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fooField2</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span>
  <span>}</span>




</code></pre></div>
<p>Everyone frowns at you when you use these accessors because if <code>FooRecord</code> has more than a single constructor, and you use an eliminator for the other constructor, your program blows up in flames. This is no different to how <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> blow up in flames when you pass as parameter an empty list.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is that <code>data</code> is a declaration that offers a bunch of different ways to create a value, and your program chooses which one interests you for the current case.</p>
<h2>Category Theory</h2>
<p>Category Theory is a branch of Mathematics mainly used by haskellers to annoy everyone else. But, believe it or not, it's also useful to reason about programs. In Category Theory we have objects and we have arrows that interconnect the objects. For something to be a Category, its objects and arrows have to obey some rules.</p>
<p>One of the constructs of Category Theory is the co-category. A co-category is a category where the arrows have been reversed. If in category X, an arrow goes from A to B, in the category co-X, the arrow goes from B to A.</p>
<p>At this point, "codata" should be suspicious to you. It totally looks like "co-data", the co-category of "data". But, how does it actually look the category of "data"?</p>
<h3>The Category of data</h3>
<p>The "data" category is revealed to us as the <code>data</code> declaration. Let's have another look at the <code>Foo</code> example:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case (but not in all categories) the types are the objects and the functions are the arrows. If we massage a little bit the code above, by using uncurrying, we can get to a data format that is a bit less arrow-ish and easier for our purposes:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now <code>Foo1</code> takes a pair of Int and String and returns a <code>Foo</code>, and <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Bool</code> and returns a <code>Foo</code>. This is pretty much what every haskeller already knows: you don't have a <code>Foo</code> via <code>Foo1</code> until you provide both the <code>Int</code> and the <code>String</code>, no matter how many arrows are in the middle.</p>
<p>And now, the case statement:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>i</span> <span>s</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's massage it a little bit to turn it into a function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fooEliminator</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foo</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>fooEliminator</span> <span>(</span><span>myfoo</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span><span>,</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>myfoo</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo1</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
    <span>Foo2</span> <span>b</span>      <span>-&gt;</span> <span>what_to_do_if_Foo2</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have converted <code>case</code> into a plain old function, we don't need to do hand-waiving and magic because everything is now plain old function composition and application. Also, all the uncurrying that all the haskellers are about to complain is just going to help us.</p>
<h3>The co-Category of data: co-data</h3>
<p>I massaged all these expressions and uncurried them because, otherwise it is confusing. I mean, a co-category is a category with the arrows flipped. Which poses the question: which arrows? All of them? Some of them? Everything is easier if there is a single arrow: it means we don't have to go figuring out which one.</p>
<p>So let's flip the arrow of the <code>Foo</code> data declaration, and let's see what comes out.</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>
<span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>Foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I happily renamed <code>data</code> to <code>codata</code>, and flipped the single arrow in each line. Let's massage it a little bit more by flipping the order of the arguments so that the arrow points to the right, because we are accustomed to see the arrow functions that way:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>codata</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>Foo1</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Foo2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What does this mean? Well, a lot of things at the same time, but let's go one by one.</p>
<p>We have two functions related to the <code>codata Foo</code>. The first, called <code>Foo1</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a pair of Int and String. The second, called <code>Foo2</code> takes a <code>Foo</code> and manufactures a <code>Bool</code>. We have two functions that take what seems to be a composite value <code>Foo</code> and extract simple values from it of types <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>The same way that we could call any of the two functions in the <code>data Foo</code> declaration, we can call any of the two functions in the <code>codata Foo</code>, and get an <code>(Int, String)</code> for the first case, and a <code>Bool</code> for the second. Nothing forces us to call both, and we can just call any one of them.</p>
<p>If we have a <code>Foo</code>, and by calling <code>Foo1</code> we get simple values from it, this looks a lot like a eliminator. But we can also call <code>Foo2</code>, which looks like another eliminator.</p>
<p>Trying to make sense of all of this, we reach a deep insight:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code> is about how we can call any of the many different constructors of a composite value.</li>
<li><code>codata</code> is about how we can call any of the many different eliminators of a composite value.</li>
</ul>
<p>From it, we can derive further insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codata looks a lot like objects and methods, where the codata value is the object, and the eliminators are the methods. There is probably some theorem out there that maps codata as a category to objects in OO programs.</li>
<li>It's not that Functional Programming is superior to Object Oriented Programming. But, the usual Functional Programmer has been an Object Oriented Programmer before. Because of this, he is likely to know <code>codata</code> from OO, and now is starting to understand <code>data</code> from FP. As a result of this, he is better armed than an Object Oriented Programmer because an Object Oriented Programmer only knows <code>codata</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further philosophical details can be extracted from the duality data-codata:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we were to find a pure FP programmer, and a pure OO programmer, they would probably have a similar level of skill, but in totally different dimensions. This would make very hard to actually figure out who is the most skilled, because their skill-sets wouldn't be comparable! How do you compare skill-set in <code>data</code> with skill-set in <code>codata</code>?</li>
<li>Data (and Functional Programming) deals on how we can construct complex datatypes from simple ones by using constructors. Codata (and Object Oriented Programming) deals on how we can extract the components from an object by calling its methods.</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> states that you should be able to add new cases and new functions to a datatype without losing type safety and without having to recompile.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an OO language, you can add a new case by creating another subclass and implementing the methods. But, if you want to add a new function to a datatype, you have to add it to the superclass and implement it on all the existing subclasses, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
<li>In a FP language you can add a new function to an existing datatype just by adding a function. But, if you want to add a new case, you have to add the constructor and modify all the functions that use the datatype, which means modifying a lot of files and recompiling most of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out, with our new data-codata knowledge, that we have a deeper insight into the Expression Problem, and …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>The images posted on Facebook, <a href="https://monetize.info/telegram-bots/">Telegram groups</a> and Twitter by independent journalists in Belarus show huge crowds of people in Minsk, but also in other cities of the country – Gomel, Brest or Baranovichi. In the latter two reportedly, police withdrew from the central area in front of thousands of protesters.</p>

<p>On the same evening, according to exit polls, <strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko</strong> would have won the election again by 79.7%, while opposition candidate <strong>Svetlana Tihanovskaia</strong> would have won only 6.8% of the suffrages.</p>
<p>The country’s authoritarian leader has previously said that everything will remain “under control”. However, independent journalists in Belarus say that citizens are angry and convinced that the elections have been rigged.</p>
<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tihanovskaia’s spokeswoman claimed her victory based on “real” results from 20 polling stations. The official asked the Central Election Commission to declare the correct results on Monday. Tihanovskaia herself urged police not to forget “that it is part of the nation.” “I know that citizens will wake up tomorrow in a new country and I hope that tomorrow will bring good news. Stop the violence. officers, I know you can do it,” the opposition candidate said. Several polling station presidents came out in front of citizens to announce what they call the “real” results of the vote. In the clip below, Tihanovskaia is announced winning by 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Aleksandr Lukashenko is in his sixth term as president of Soviet-state Belarus and has ruled the country since 1994.</strong> He is in office for the longest time of all European heads of state (except monarchs). In Belarusian society, the “Old Man” is unofficially called.</p>
