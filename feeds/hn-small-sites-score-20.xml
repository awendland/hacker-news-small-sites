					<div>
					<p>On the day the sun didn’t rise in San Francisco, the early warning signs came through the screen. The 6:30 a.m. Zoom always requires unnatural light, making the outlines of faces fuzzy. The natural morning light, combined with the “Touch Up My Appearance” feature on 2020’s preferred video conferencing system, hides the marks of age and sleeplessness that most of us seek to mask. But by 9:00, the fluorescent light was still dominating the screen, and the darkness outside our windows had turned to infernal orange.</p>
<p>The scientific explanation for our sunless day in September is pretty dull. The clouds of soot from the largest California wildfire in history intermixed with the Bay Area’s perennial fog, turning the usual sepia hue of dirty global cities into an apocalyptic blood-orange sky. Though Twitter blamed the hellscape on far more menacing forces, the direct cause of our Blade Runner Day was mostly carbon clinging to the blue-light hues while letting the red pierce through.</p>
<p>If we were more like ancient peoples, many joked, we would assume the gods were enraged. We’d be running for the hills to escape their wrath, or at least head straight for our prepper bunkers. That we are unlike ancient people is actually the only myth, as this is exactly the exodus that is happening in Silicon Valley right now—and will continue for the next few years as true believers deliver themselves from this promised land.</p>
<p><a href="https://breakingground.us/from-ashes/">It’s time to build</a>, yes. But it’s also time to leave.</p>
<p>The battle over tech’s supremacy has been waged and all of our premonitions came true: We wanted flying cars and got vertical take-off innovation hubs from every car maker in America. Software has not only eaten the world, but feasted on your screen-weary eyes. It has swallowed your children, your church, your bank, and your politics, and somehow it all feels inevitable. That these feats of human progress—of instant connectivity in a now homebound world—became the scapegoat of our time is another symptom of the era’s end, cueing the quiet exodus of builders who had bigger aspirations than the same-day shipping that keeps our households afloat.</p>
<p>Now, Silicon Valley is witnessing a reckoning, but it’s not the long-awaited one predicted by the New York press, or the antitrust bonanza that Washington longs for because too many people seem satisfied getting their news from Facebook. The reckoning is more of a realization that tech exceeded expectations and somehow squandered the fruit of its own garden, and that a city on a hill that could have supported so much innovation was not Florence in the Renaissance nor the Athenian Academy with MacBooks. Rather, it became a government-sponsored needle exchange, a haven for the homeless and forgotten that put government’s paralysis on display downtown on Market Street.</p>
<blockquote><p>2020 is not the great reckoning predicted in the book of Revelation, despite the fires, the plagues, and the wailing on Twitter. It is the resignation and determination of Exodus, of a dogged people packing up U-Hauls and fleeing this frontier state to seek an even newer, more eternal world.</p></blockquote>
<p>San Francisco had four times as many deaths from overdose this year as it did from the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>2020 is not the great reckoning predicted in the book of Revelation, despite the fires, the plagues, and the wailing on Twitter. It is the resignation and determination of Exodus, of a dogged people packing up U-Hauls and fleeing this frontier state to seek an even newer, more eternal world.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The computer revolution of the late twentieth century has yet to be named as an epoch, but we can assume that nomenclature will begin in the coming years, alongside the battle for what it all really meant.</p>
<p>What we now call our “technological age” was supposed to be a full-throated and enduring argument for the future, not unlike previous epochs in history that pushed art, science, philosophy, and religion forward in dizzying ways that run counter to ordinary time. The Enlightenment. The Renaissance. The French Revolution. These movements now sit as categories on our bookshelves with clear beginnings and ends, and more importantly, clear hubs and cities of frenetic building that drove the ethos forward. Many books assume that contemporary critics or philosophers were blissfully ignorant to the unraveling of their revolutions, but we should not assume that contemporaries did not feel the same twilight setting. The figurative orange skies always creep in before dawn.</p>


<p>Which brings us to the supposed death of Silicon Valley, a fate that has long been predicted but with data now finally catching up. San Francisco apartment rents in 2020 have deflated by 20 percent after an up-up-and-away decade that made the city truly unlivable. Home inventory has reached a fifteen-year high in a city blighted by restrictive housing policy that makes construction cranes as miraculous as stumbling upon a burning bush. The growth in online sales-tax collection, according to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, is the lowest of all counties in the state of California. And public tech companies, such as Pinterest, paid upwards of $90 million to break its lease in downtown San Francisco. Some would argue this is a clear end to Bay Area tech dominance, while others would point to the many new unicorns that popped up this year despite the once-in-a-century pandemic. No one’s living here, yet somehow the companies are still growing.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley doesn’t really have cultural critics to weigh in on whether this era is officially over, but we do have venture capitalists. And our Nostradomuses are telling us that change is afoot.</p>
<p><em>Do we really need this office? The founders all have left.</em></p>
<p><em>Their entire partnership is now living in Montana. It’s only a two-hour flight away!</em></p>
<p><em>Denver seems like a good option, but Reno has no state income tax.</em></p>
<p>The weirdness of this exodus is that it is not driven by fear. Technologists weren’t <em>really </em>driven out by plague or fire or San Francisco’s insatiable need for higher tax revenue. Those ills were always apparent, and yet people stayed to carry the torch.</p>
<p>The exodus of tech’s true believers may be that the covenant is finally fulfilled. That when America—along with the rest of the world—met their darkest hour and turned inward, the technology that was long ridiculed as frivolous or dangerous led us to relative normalcy. The Zooms. The Tiger Kings. The Signal chats. The Slack jokes. An election news cycle that plowed ruthlessly forward on Twitter. Though inconvenient, mothers and fathers set their children in front of screens to occupy them for <em>just</em> long enough to survive a terrible year. And maybe, just maybe, the same-day-shipping racket that made Jeff Bezos the richest man alive was actually a feat of human genius that held the country together when public infrastructure and the social fabric were fraying at the seams. Perhaps our lowly software revolution was actually the fruition of a long-held California dream, when the physical world forced us inside and virtual life prevailed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Silicon Valley is no longer a place, they’ll say. It’s a way of being, of building, and the latest embodiment of belief in human progress. And it’s spreading faster than the viruses and the wildfires and the apocalyptic threats that mire our physical world.</p></blockquote>
<p>For that triumph, the nerds can now smell the impending scapegoating of their success. And like so many of history’s prophets and heretics, those who believe most fervently in the promise of technology are beginning their long march away from the Valley.</p>
<p>And they will substitute the virtual world for the physical space that once defined this movement. Silicon Valley is no longer a place, they’ll say. It’s a way of being, of building, and the latest embodiment of belief in human progress. And it’s spreading faster than the viruses and the wildfires and the apocalyptic threats that mire our physical world.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is over. The exodus is just beginning.</p>

<![CDATA[The Flaws of “Subscription Fatigue”, “SVOD Fatigue”, and the “Streaming Wars”]]>

November 10, 2020 | https://www.matthewball.vc/all/misnomers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.matthewball.vc/all/misnomers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-96dbb3b03808a860d80e"><div><p>When we consider the state of tech-media in 2020, there are a few common narratives. The most inescapable is the “Streaming Wars”. In November, I argued that <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/minedmedia">this term was a misnomer</a>. Digital/streaming/OTT video is really just <em>a</em> battle in a much larger war: the “ecosystem war”. And for the most part, this war is fought asymmetrically. Apple and Amazon both sell digital media devices, third-party media content, and their own original content, for example. However, Apple isn’t an e-retailer nor a diversified enterprise cloud services provider, and Amazon doesn’t even have a smartphone, personal computer, watch or non-video app store. I’ll come back to this idea, but understanding the differences between these companies and their motivations is helpful when considering two other popular phases that are unhelpful at best and misleading at worst: “subscription fatigue” and “SVOD fatigue”.</p><p><strong>“Subscription Fatigue”</strong></p><p>The “subscription economy”, by definition, presumes that the overall “economy” – from products, to services, content, transportation, labor and more – is shifting over to “subscriptions”. Thus, to claim that consumers have “subscription fatigue” is to say that they have “spending fatigue”.</p><p>As always, most consumers will say they wish they spent less money, bought fewer things, and enjoyed lower prices. However, it makes little sense to say that the decision to buy TV subscriptions, radio subscriptions, toothbrush subscriptions, video gaming subscriptions, dog food subscriptions, car subscriptions, or productivity software subscriptions should drive “subscription fatigue” or mean each subscription competes with one another. For decades, consumers have bought TV, music, toothbrushes, video games, dog food, cars and Microsoft Office. What’s new is that they all have similar models – digitally-based, predominantly D2C subscriptions. This changes nothing about the individual value or baseline need for them.</p><p>Of course, the “subscription economy” does mean that step one of a recession will be to “re-evaluate all subscriptions”. However, this does not mean subscription <em>fatigue</em> should be considered a real “thing”, let alone a defining element of modern-day competition. Furthermore, payment model – upfront v. recurring, subscription v. á la carte, online v. offline – is irrelevant to what’s “re-evaluated” and not. Some subscriptions are “necessities”, like toilet paper, while others are concerned with discretionary spend, such as Office 365 or Netflix or Tinder. This latter group isn’t competitive because they’re “subscriptions”, but because there is, as always, finite spending money for non-essential items. </p><p>To this end, it’s important to highlight subscriptions are often a <em>preferred</em> buying path for consumers. Most would rather (or can only afford) $10 a month for a multi-year license to Microsoft Office for $300. Subscriptions also meaningfully reduce the cognitive burden of repeat decision making. No longer do you need to “track” your toothbrush for wear, risk “running out” of toilet paper and then be forced to overpay for a small-volume purchase, or need to scan and hoard coupons to ensure a great deal. Similarly, many consumers would rather marginally overpay for an all-you-can-eat subscription than optimize for specific tiers of use. In fact, most of us have caustic responses to per unit pricing, often to the point of irrationality (e.g. $40 for 35 loads of laundry detergent v. $1.00 per load). Amazon Prime is based on the <em>need</em> to get shipping fees out of the way once, versus fight them over and over and over and over, even if the effective shipping cost went up for a consumer, or the lack of shipping costs led to unnecessary purchases.</p><p>The rise of fully flexible monthly commitments also means that consumers no longer have to worry about having made a bad decision and being stuck with it. In this sense, every subscription is still á la carte, but unlike in the analog era, the default outcome of “doing nothing” is to keep getting value you enjoy rather than running out of a thing you need. </p><p><em>(Note that none of this means that a digital subscription business is a “good” one. Many sub-categories of CPGs and foodstuffs, not to mention music or fitness equipment, weren’t good business before the shift to subscription. The fact they shifted to subscriptions doesn’t inherently change this, just as it doesn’t mean they suddenly compete with all other subscriptions).</em></p><p><strong>“SVOD Fatigue”</strong></p><p>Of course, the nuances of “subscription fatigue” is separate from the question of “Subscription <em>VOD</em> fatigue”. It is obvious consumers don’t need 20 Netflixes. However, they’re not being asked to buy 20 Netflixes. It’s wrong to treat Fox Nation, Netflix, ESPN, and Twitch as competitors, let alone interchangeable “units of SVOD”. They serve very different functions and offer very different content. Just as Spotify and the <em>New York Times</em> and Amazon Prime shipping each do.</p><p>Amazon and Apple TV+, meanwhile, aren’t Netflixes – not in monetization, content volumes, or strategy. Now, if Amazon or Apple’s SVOD services can monetize so dramatically better through the Prime and iOS ecosystem than Netflix can via direct consumer spend and a singular focus, they can, in theory, “kill” Netflix – should they so choose – but that has nothing to do with SVOD fatigue nor the number of viable SVODs.</p><p>The question of SVOD fatigue isn’t about “how many SVODs will the average household have”. It’s really about “how many different roles are there to be played in video”. And the answer here is mostly path dependent – it depends on the innovation, risk taking, and discovery that happens in the marketplace, as well as timing. No one knew “live streaming video games” was an opportunity until Twitch, for example. And while Twitch likely steals <em>time</em> away from the video ecosystem, the viability of the Twitch subscription doesn’t mean that the number of viable OTT services has reduced.</p><p><strong>The Question</strong></p><p>All of which is to say what matters in SVOD is simple and not unique to SVOD: <span>A service will succeed if (1) it addresses a real, outstanding customer want/need; (2) at an appropriate price or value to the consumer; and (3) while generating sustainable economics</span>. </p><p>Quibi is a good example here. The company believes that there is an outstanding need for a new type of content, focused on a different time and place, under a different viewing behavior and focused on a specific audience. If it is right, and it can build up a defensible leadership position before other players replicate it, a new subscription will be possible and it doesn’t matter how many SVODs a customer already has (just as whether they have NYT or Spotify doesn’t matter). But of course, if you ask consumers “do you wish you had fewer subscriptions” or “fewer SVODs”, they will say yes – especially if they don’t really know what the new “thing” is. Note, too, that Pay-TV studies have been promising that 10%–30% of subscribers will cancel each year. They never do… because enough value remains. </p><p>More broadly, this three-point framework is well established (it actually has nothing to do with video). Over the past forty years, we have seen countless examples of “networks” launching into hyper-saturated marketplaces with hyper-specific but unproven (and often openly derided) theses regarding outstanding consumer wants and needs. Almost all of these have succeeded. In fact, they usually spawned several direct competitors – showing that the unmet want was even larger than originally anticipated. &nbsp;</p><p>For example…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>1972: HBO launched a network focused on the most valuable TV time, Sunday night, with an unprecedented monetization model (á la carte consumer spend and no advertising), and focused only on reruns of Hollywood movies. It was ultimately bought by 25% of TV homes, became the most profitable network in the world and the market leader in quality. And this was despite the launches of Showtime (1976), Starz (1994) and Epix (2009).</em></p></li><li><p><em>1977: Nickelodeon launched 24/7 content only for kids. No longer was kids content relegated just to afternoon and Sunday morning blocks. In the 2000s, Nickelodeon became the most watched cable network, despite having spun-off several other Nick-branded channels and seen the launch of The Disney Channel in 1983.</em></p></li><li><p><em>1979: ESPN launched a 24/7 sports channel, ultimately with the highest programming budget in the world. In 2019, it brought in more than $2.5B in profits, with an annual revenue of roughly $9B. In 2009, Fox launched its own suite of 24/7 Fox-branded sports networks.</em></p></li><li><p><em>1980: CNN launched a 24/7 news channel. Today, it generates an estimated $800MM a year in cash flow on $2B in revenue, and several other 24/7 networks exist.</em></p></li><li><p><em>1981: MTV launched a 24/7 music video and culture channel that focused only on young audiences. The result was the first new Hollywood film/TV conglomerate in decades. Within years, MTV had launched several other 24/7 networks, while competitors launched even more focused versions, such as CMT.</em></p></li><li><p><em>1983: BET launched a 24/7 network focused on black American audiences. In 2001, the company was sold to Viacom for $3B. Several other black-focused networks exist today. </em></p></li><li><p><em>1996: Fox News launched a 24/7 news channel… only for half of news watchers. It now generates more than $1.5B in cash on $2.5B+ revenue</em></p></li></ul><p>Of course, this sort of logic can be used to justify faulty assumptions around what opportunity exists, where, how large it might be, how durable it is, etc. In addition, these specifics gaps were open because of technological limitations. A network like ABC could only air one thing at a time – and therefore there were structural impediments to serving “everyone”. Netflix, meanwhile, can air anything, at any time, to every viewer, and on an individual basis.</p><p>But the crucial point here is that it’s wrong to think about the “number” of subscription video services, just as it was wrong to think about how “many” networks were in the cable bundle in 1980, 1985, 1990, and so on. In fact, it’s incredibly close …</p></div></div></div>

               <h3>
                  Work stress and burnout are mutually reinforcing / Surprisingly, the effect of work stress on burnout is much smaller than the effect of burnout on work stress
               </h3>
               <p>
                  10 November 2020
               </p>
               <p>
                  Stress and overload in the workplace are increasing worldwide and are often considered a cause of burnout. Indeed, a new study shows that work stress and burnout are mutually reinforcing. However, contrary to popular belief, burnout has a much greater impact on work stress than vice versa. "This means that the more severe a person's burnout becomes, the more stressed they will feel at work, such as being under time pressure, for example," said Professor Christian Dormann of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU). Employees suffering from burnout should be timely provided with adequate support in order to break the vicious circle between work stress and burnout.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Symptoms of burnout include exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced performance. "The most important burnout symptom is the feeling of total exhaustion – to the extent that it cannot be remedied by normal recovery phases of an evening, a weekend, or even a vacation," said Dormann. "To protect themselves from further exhaustion, some try to build a psychological distance to their work, that is, they alienate themselves from their work as well as the people associated with it and become more cynical," added Dr. Christina Guthier. She conducted the study as part of her doctoral thesis in Dormann's research group and was awarded with the dissertation prize of the Alfred Teves Foundation in 2020. The study has recently been published in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For the joint publication with Professor Christian Dormann and Professor Manuel Völkle of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Christina Guthier evaluated 48 longitudinal studies of burnout and work stress comprising 26,319 participants. The average age in the initial survey was about 42 years, 44 percent of the respondents were men. The longitudinal studies from 1986 to 2019 came from various countries, including predominantly European countries as well as Israel, the USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, China, and Taiwan.
               </p>
               <h4>
                  Stopping the downward spiral and reducing the effect of burnout on work stress
               </h4>
               <p>
                  The results challenge, or at least relativize, the common perception that work stress is the driving force behind burnout. "Burnout can be triggered by a work situation, but that is not always the case," Dormann pointed out. Once burnout begins, it develops only very gradually, building up slowly over time. Ultimately it leads to work being increasingly perceived as stressful: The amount of work is too much, time is too short, and work stress is too great. "When exhausted, the ability to cope with stress usually decreases. As a result, even smaller tasks can be perceived as significantly more strenuous," explained Guthier, the first author of the article. "We expected an effect of burnout on work stress; the strength of the effect was very surprising," she noted. The effect of burnout on perceived work stress can be somewhat mitigated if employees have more control over their own work and receive support from colleagues or superiors.
               </p>
               <p>
                  According to Dormann, a new research area is emerging on the basis of this unique data because the strong boomerang effect of burnout on work stress has not yet been investigated. Key questions that need to be addressed are: how can the effects of burnout on perceived work stress be reduced and how can the development of this vicious circle be prevented? Dormann and Guthier suggest that the place to start is with management behavior. Employees should have the opportunity to give feedback on their work stress at any time and be appreciated. Last but not least, proper recovery could also help to stop the downward spiral.

				<p>(Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tank_ghisletti?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Francisco Ghisletti</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/greek-gods?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>)</p><p>(This post is mostly fun and tongue-in-cheek, please contain your indignation.)</p><p>Every so often I encounter a comment on HackerNews that involuntarily makes my jaw drop, head shake and eyes water. It's usually concerning what some on HackerNews consider a 'worthwhile' amount of money you can earn as an solopreneur or maker VS being an employee. </p><p>Obviously, it's probably a small minority of the silent masses who scroll through HN daily who have these views, but comments like the following, or a variant of it comes up so often I can't help but feel that a decent part of the community is <em>ridiculously</em> out of touch with the rest of humanity. </p><p>Behold.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">😂 <a href="https://t.co/mg1UFHxp08">https://t.co/mg1UFHxp08</a></p>— Pete from No CS Degree (@petecodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/petecodes/status/1326144308706209798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>$1000 per month from a side project is considered meh. 😳 🙃</p><p>And here's another from the same day,</p><figure><img src="https://www.riknieu.com/content/images/2020/11/soundslikealot.png"></figure><p>And from the same user a few scrolls later,</p><figure><img src="https://www.riknieu.com/content/images/2020/11/FANG.png"></figure><p>My god. Look, the commenter had the self awareness to bring up regional cost of living and that not everyone can work at the FAMANGs of the world, but really? Getting $3.7 million dollars for just 7 years of work is, like, a bad deal?</p><p>To consider making $500K pa as a doable, realistic salary to be taken into account when deciding between starting a company or just seeking a job... Like us millennials say, "I can't. Even." </p><p>That annual salary far outstrips what I can reasonably expect to earn in a decade, and I'm a developer working for a fintech startup with a good couple of years under my belt. For most people in the world, $500K pa is a <em><strong>preposterous</strong></em> amount of money. </p><p>I'm too lazy to go dig up more examples, but I'm sure you'll find some more gems like these if you go digging around on past threads.</p><p>This kind of poo-pooing of what most - and I'm talking 90% of the US population, never mind the rest of the world! - would consider rather large amounts of money is incredibly mind-blowing and makes my head spin.</p><p>Now I'm sure that in commenters like the above's worlds, that kind of money is indeed average and peanuts, but I wanted to write this article for myself and the rest of us to just try and deal. </p><p>I'm trying to make sense of the fact that I'm on this forum, interacting with people everyday, talking about current events and issues, that make more money per year than I can even imagine. In a way we're peers, but more realistically they're like the gods of Olympus who occasionally slum it with the rest of us.</p><p>So if you're like me, and you consider even a $1000 as lot of money, let's look at this as average mortals should.</p><h2 id="1-1000pm-is-a-flippen-lot">1) $1000pm is a flippen lot</h2><p>Let's go with the $1000 pm example, because figures like $3.6 million is, to be frank, in the realms of La-La land for me and almost everyone I know personally. </p><p>And let's - for the sake of simplicity - assume that you can take home 60% of that revenue as net earnings. And that the project doesn't take up more free time with maintenance and support issues than you can handle on your own. That's $600 per month. Extra. From a thing on the side. </p><p>I realise that I live in one of those cheap, unappealing parts of the world, but that kinda money would easily cover me and my family's rent every month, and then some. Do you realise how much of a mental weight that can take off a persons shoulders? To know rent is covered over and above your day-job earnings?</p><p>Away with your $1000-is-not-worth-it malarky!</p><h2 id="2-making-money-with-your-own-products-is-hard-">2) Making money with your own products is HARD.</h2><p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174">this post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx">Chris McCormick</a>, titled "<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174">Holy heck this is hard</a>". </p><p>When he last checked, 12 solo founders out of 17207 made more than $10K MRR. Only 54 products made more than $2000pm. I don't think I need to express that in ratios for you to see the probability of making a profitable project.</p><p>Starting a product and <em>actually earning money from it</em> is hard. Insanely hard. Hell, if you manage to make even $100pm from a side project you've got my respect. You've got me beat by a lot!</p><p>When I see makers on IndieHackers or Twitter celebrate $100 in sales I get genuinely excited for them. It's really an incredible feat. Bravo to them, I wish them luck and more success in the future.</p><h2 id="that-1000-per-month-can-grow">That $1000 per month can grow</h2><p>Another thing to consider is that earning a $1000 pm means your project is basically validated and ready to explode. With work, you could probably scale it to much higher multiples. </p><p>Sure, the money it makes is negligible to the higher beings in Silicon Valley, but for us regular plebs that's a <em>strong</em> signal that your project potentially has legs. It might even be a project you could sell for $3.7 million dollars in 7 years time, if you put the work in and get a little lucky.</p><h2 id="ya-but-rik-cost-of-living">Ya, but Rik, cost of living</h2><p>Sure, things cost more in the States. And more so in SanFran. But I can't just up and go live in the States. Nor pretty much anywhere else in the First World. A heck of a lot of the people frequenting HN, TW and IH on a daily basis could probably not either.</p><p>So for people like us, it's inspiring to read about some rando making a $1000 pm, on their own, independently. It gives us hope that some dude in Alabama could start a thing and sell it for more money than we could expect to earn in a lifetime as a salaried employee. Because maybe that means we could too.</p><p>Because they used the same tools we have access too(except for Stripe 😝). They had access to the same markets we could reach. </p><p>And they make the kinds of money with those tools that could buy people like us freedom. Freedom from being chained to a job, freedom from financial stress, and possibly even the freedom to move our families to better places in the world. Places that others just get born in.</p><p>So when you see smarmy comments on HackerNews new putting down the success of others, take a step back and realise, it's not meant for you. It's not personal. </p><p>These are merely the musings of a few lucky, privileged gods, reflecting on the toils of the mortals.</p><p>Thanks for reading. If you have any comments or suggestions, follow and contact me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/riknieu">@RikNieu</a>.</p><p>If you want to read more of my rants, sign up below and I'll mail you when I post new stuff. 👇</p>

<h3><a href="https://rg3.name/202011071352.html">Origins of the youtube-dl project</a></h3>
<p>Posted on <time>2020-11-07T13:52Z</time>. Updated on <time>2020-11-10T16:28Z</time>.</p>


<p>As you may know, as of the time this text is being written <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl’s repository at GitHub</a> is blocked due to a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA takedown letter</a> received by GitHub on behalf of the RIAA. While I cannot comment on the current maintainers' plans or ongoing discussions, in light of the claims made in that letter I thought it would be valuable to put in writing the first years of youtube-dl as the project creator and initial maintainer.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_copper_thieves">Copper thieves</h4>
<p>All good stories need at least a villain so I have arbitrarily chosen copper thieves as the villains of the story that set in motion what youtube-dl is today. Back in 2006 I was living in a town 5 to 10 kilometers away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avil%C3%A9s">Avilés</a>, which is itself a small city or town in northern Spain. While people in Avilés enjoyed some nice infrastructures and services, including cable and ADSL Internet access, the area I lived in lacked those advantages. I was too far away from the telephone exchange to enjoy ADSL and copper thieves had been stealing copper wires along the way to it for years, causing telephone service outages from time to time and making the telephone company replace those wires with weaker and thinner wires, knowing they would likely be stolen again. This had been going on for several years at that point.</p>
<p>This meant my only choice for home Internet access so far had been a dial-up connection and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem#Standardized_56k_(V.90/V.92)">56k V.90 modem</a>. In fact, connection quality was so poor I had to limit the modem to 33.6 kbps mode so the connection would be at least stable. Actual download speeds rarely surpassed 4 KB/sec. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a> was gaining popularity then to the point it was purchased by Google at the end of that year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_up_all_night_to_get_some_bits">Up all night to get some bits</h4>
<p>Watching any YouTube video on the kind of connection I described above was certainly painful, as you can imagine. Any video that was moderately big would take ages to download. For example, a short 10 MB video would take, if you do the math, 40 minutes to download, making streaming impossible. A longer and higher-quality video would take several hours and render the connection unusable for other purposes while you waited for it to be available, not to mention the possibility of the connection being interrupted and having to start the download process again. Now imagine liking a specific video a lot after watching it and wanting to watch it a second or third time. Going through that process again was almost an act of masochism.</p>
<p>This situation made me interested in the possibility of downloading the videos I was trying to watch: if the video was interesting, having a copy meant I could watch it several times easily. Also, if the downloader was any good, maybe the download process could be resumed if the connection was interrupted, as it frequently was.</p>
<p>At the time, there were other solutions to download videos from YouTube, including a quite popular <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> script. By pure chance, none of the few I tested were working when I did, so I decided to explore the possibility of creating my own tool. And that is, more or less, how youtube-dl was born. I made it a command-line program so it would be easy to use for me and wrote it in Python because it was easy thanks to its extensive standard library, with the nice side effect that it would be platform independent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_an_ethereal_start">An Ethereal start</h4>
<p>The initial version of the program only worked for YouTube videos. It had almost no internal design whatsoever because it was not needed. It did what it had to do as a simple script that proceeded straight to the point. Line count was merely 223, with only 143 being actual lines of code, 44 for comments and 36 of them blank. The name was chosen out of pure convenience: youtube-dl was an obvious name, hard to forget, and it could be intuitively typed as “Y-O-U-TAB” in my terminal.</p>
<p>Having been using Linux for several years at that point, I decided to publish the program under a free software license (MIT for those first versions) just in case someone could find it useful. Back then, GitHub did not exist and we had to “make do” with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge">SourceForge</a>, which had a bit of a tedious form that you needed to fill to create a new project. So, instead of going to SourceForge, I quickly published it under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060812055952/http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/">the web space that my Internet provider gave me</a>. While not usual today, it was common for ISPs to give you an email address and some web space you could upload stuff to using FTP. That way, you could have your own personal website on the net. The first ever version made public was 2006.08.08, although I probably had been using the program for a few weeks at that point.</p>
<p>To create the program, I studied what the web browser was doing when watching a YouTube video using Firefox. If I recall correctly, Firefox didn’t yet have the development tools it has today to analyze network activity. Connections were mostly HTTP and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark">Wireshark</a>, known as “Ethereal” up to that year, proved invaluable to inspect the network traffic coming in and out of my box when loading a YouTube video. I wrote youtube-dl with the specific goal of doing the same things the web browser was doing to retrieve the video. It even sent out a User-Agent string that was verbatim copied from Firefox for Linux, as a way to make sure the site would send the program the same version of video web pages that were used to study what the web browser was doing.</p>
<p>In addition, YouTube used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> back then for the player. Videos were served as Flash Video files (FLV), and this all meant a proprietary plugin was required to watch them on the browser (many will remember the dreaded <code>libflashplayer.so</code> library), which would have made any browser development tools useless. This proprietary plugin was a constant source of security advisories and problems. I used a Firefox extension called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashblock">Flashblock</a> that prevented the plugin from being loaded by default and replaced embedded content using the plugin, in web pages, with placeholder elements containing a clickable icon so content would be loaded only on demand and the plugin library was not used unless requested by the user.</p>
<p>Flashblock had two nice side effects apart from making the browsing experience more secure. On the one hand, it removed a lot of noisy and obnoxious ads from many web pages, which could also be a source of security problems when served by third parties. On the other hand, it eased analyzing how videos were being downloaded by the video player. I would wait until the video page had finished downloading completely and then start logging traffic with Wireshark just before clicking on the embedded video player placeholder icon, allowing it to load. This way, the only traffic to analyze was related to the plugin downloading the video player application and the application itself downloading the video.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting the Flash Player plugin back then <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/copy_flash_flv_temp_file.html">was already downloading a copy of those videos to your hard drive</a> (they were stored in <code>/tmp</code> under Linux) and many users relied on that functionality to keep a copy of them without using additional tools. youtube-dl was simply more convenient because it could retrieve the video title and name the file more appropriately in an automated way, for example.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_ahh_fresh_meat">Ahh, fresh meat!</h4>
<p>The Flash Player plugin was eventually <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/saving-flash-videos-in-linux-tmp-no-longer-works">modified so videos wouldn’t be so easily available to grab</a>. One of the first measures was to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlink_(Unix)">unlink</a> the video file after creating it, so the i-node would still exist and be available to the process using it (until it was closed) while keeping the file invisible from the file system point of view. It was still possible to grab the file by using the <code>/proc</code> file system to examine file descriptors used by the browser process, but with every one of those small steps youtube-dl turned to be more and more convenient.</p>
<p>As many free and open source enthusiasts back then, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecode">Freshmeat</a> to subscribe to new releases of projects I was interested in. When I created youtube-dl, I also created a project entry for it in that website so users could easily get notifications of new releases and a change log listing new features, fixes and improvements. Freshmeat could also be browsed to find new and interesting projects and its front page contained the latest updates, which usually amounted to only a few dozens a day. It’s only my guess that’s the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Barr">Joe Barr</a> (rest in peace), an editor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux.com">linux.com</a>, found out about the program and decided to write <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/cli-magic-enhance-your-youtube-viewing-pleasure/">an article about it</a> back in 2006. Linux.com was a bit different then and I think it was one of the frequently-visited sites for Linux enthusiasts together with other classics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot">Slashdot</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LWN.net">Linux Weekly News</a>. At least, it was for me.</p>
<p>From that point on, youtube-dl’s popularity started to grow and I started getting some emails from time to time to thank me for creating and maintaining the program.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_measuring_buckets_of_bits">Measuring buckets of bits</h4>
<p>Fast forward to the year 2008. youtube-dl’s popularity had kept growing slowly and users frequently asked me to create similar programs to download from more sites, a request I had conceded a few times. It was at that point that I decided to rewrite the program from scratch and make it support multiple video sites natively. I had some simple ideas that would separate the program internals into several pieces. To simplify the most important parts: one would be the file downloader, common for every website, and another one would be the information extractors: objects (classes) that would contain code specific to a video site. When given a URL or pseudo-URL, the information extractors would be queried to know which one could handle that type of URL and then requested to extract information about that video or list of videos, with the primary goal of obtaining the video URL or a list of video URLs with available formats, together with some other metadata like the video titles, for example.</p>
<p>I also took the chance to switch version control systems and change where the project would be hosted. …</p></div></div></div></div>

                    <p><em>I don’t normally do any translation, because Interconnected is focused on original work and thinking. But I felt compelled to provide an English version of Jack Ma’s speech on October 24 at the Bund Finance Summit in Shanghai, because mainstream media coverage of the speech and the subsequent cancellation of Ant Group’s IPO has been lacking and simplistic. The speech is worth reading in its entirety to have a deeper understanding the full picture. Below is my unofficial translation of the speech </em><a href="https://sfl.global/news_post/mayunshanghaiwaitanjinrongluntanyanjiangquanwenwushanjian/"><em>based on a Chinese transcript</em></a><em>, with minor edits for clarity and speechifying. To read my deep dive analysis on the speech and its broader context, please check out: "<a href="https://interconnected.blog/jack-ma-p2p-lending-responsibility-legacy/">Jack Ma, P2P Lending, Responsibility, Legacy</a>"</em></p><p><em>我通常不做任何翻译工作，因为《互联》专注于原创作品和思考。但我觉得有必要提供马云10月24日在上海外滩金融峰会上的演讲的一个英文版，尽管只是我个人非官方的翻译，因为主流媒体对演讲和随后蚂蚁集团取消上市的报道太欠缺，过于简单化。整套演讲值得一读来更深层的了解整个事情，可以在</em><a href="https://sfl.global/news_post/mayunshanghaiwaitanjinrongluntanyanjiangquanwenwushanjian/"><em>这里看全文</em></a><em>，在</em><a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2020-10-28/doc-iiznctkc8161643.shtml"><em>这里看视频</em></a><em>。想看我对这套演讲和有关大观景的深度分析，请读《<a href="https://interconnected.blog/jack-ma-p2p-lending-responsibility-legacy/">马云，P2P借贷，责任，留给社会的遗产</a>》</em></p><hr><p>Thank you for inviting me to this Summit. I am delighted to have this opportunity to learn, discuss, and exchange ideas together with you. In 2013, also in Shanghai, I came to the Lujiazui Finance Summit and shared some “pie in the sky” views about Internet-powered finance. Seven years later, today I'm back in Shanghai as an unofficial non-professional person here at the Bund Finance Summit, hoping to share more ideas for you to ponder.</p><p>Actually, I was quite torn about whether to speak here today. But I think there is one thing that is incumbent upon this group of people, and that is the responsibility to think about the future, because although the world has left us many opportunities for development, there are really only one or two critical opportunities. This is a most critical moment.</p><p>So I come here to share some of my own thoughts and views, which are the result of our own practical experience in the last 16 years, plus discussions and research I have had with scholars, experts, and practitioners from all over the world, during the period when I was honored to be the co-chair of the UN High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation and an advocate for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>I’m basically retired at this point, so I thought I'd speak freely at this unofficial forum and share the non-professional views of a non-professional person. Fortunately, I've discovered that many professionals no longer speak about their professions anymore.</p><p>I have three points of view for you to consider. They may be immature, incorrect, or laughable. Just give them a listen, if they make no sense, just forget about them.</p><p>The first point of view is we have some inertia in our thinking, like we always feel that in order to keep pace with international standards, we must do what developed countries like Europe and the United States have done. If we don’t have something they have, the so-called “blank spot”, we must fill those blank spots domestically. Filling these spots has become the goal to pursue.</p><p>I have always felt that, given this year's situation, the phrase to “fill the blank spot” is problematic. Just because Europe and the United States have something does not mean that thing is always advanced and worth having ourselves. In fact, today, we should not be concerned about what things to align with, which country's standard to adapt to, what blank spots to fill. Today, we have to think about how to align with the future, how to adapt to the future’s standard, how to fill the future’s blank spots. We have to figure out what the future will be, and what we really want to do, and then look at how others do it. If we always repeat the language of others, discuss topics defined by others, we will not only be lost in the present, but also miss the future.</p><p>After World War II, the world needed to restore economic prosperity. The establishment of the Bretton Woods system was an enormous catalyst to the global economy. Later, after the Asian financial crisis occurred, the Basel Accords talked about risk control, which has been gaining more and more attention, to the point that it became an operational standard for risk control. Now the trend is, the world is talking more and more just about risk control, not development. Very few people talk about where the opportunities are for young people, for developing countries.</p><p>This, in fact, is the root cause of many of the world's problems today. We also see today that the Basel Accords have put great limitations on Europe’s ability to innovate as a whole, for example, in digital finance.</p><p>Basel, more like a seniors club, is about solving the problem of an aging financial system that has been operating for decades, and Europe’s aging system is extremely complex. But the problem in China is the opposite: it is not a problem of systemic financial risk, because China's financial sector basically doesn’t have a system. Its risk is actually a "lack of financial system."</p><p>China's financial sector, like other developing countries that have just grown up, is a young industry that does not have a mature ecosystem and is not fully moving. China has many big banks. They are more like big rivers or arteries in our body’s circulatory system, but today we need more lakes, ponds, streams and tributaries, all kinds of swamps. Without these parts of the ecosystem, we will die when we are flooded, and die when we are in a drought. So, today we are a country that bears the risk of lacking a healthy financial system, and we need to build a healthy financial system, not worry about financial systemic risks.</p><p>They are like two completely different diseases, like Alzheimer's disease and polio. Both look similar at first glance but are two totally different illnesses. If a child takes Alzheimer's medication, he or she will not only get the old person’s disease, but a lot of other strange diseases as well.</p><p>The Basel Accords is designed to treat the diseases of the elderly with an aging system and over-complexity, and what we have to think about is what can we learn from the elderly? You must remember, older people and younger people care about different issues. Younger people care about whether there are schools, older people care about whether there are hospitals.</p><p>So, the way the world is changing this year is fascinating and very fast. Last night in Shanghai, we decided on the pricing of Ant’s IPO. This is the largest listing ever priced in the history of the entire human race, and the pricing happened in a place other than New York City. This was unthinkable five years ago, even three years ago, but miracles happen.</p><p>Second, innovation must come at a price, and our generation must take on that responsibility.</p><p>President Xi once said, "success does not have to come from me." I understand this phrase to be about a sense of responsibility. It’s about taking responsibility for the future, for tomorrow, for the next generation. Many of the world's problems today, including China's, can only be solved by innovation. However, for real innovation to happen, no one will show you the way, and someone must shoulder that responsibility, because innovation is bound to make mistakes. But the question is not how not to make mistakes, but whether we can perfect and correct them after making mistakes and persistently innovate. To make risk-free innovation is to stifle innovation, and there is no risk-free innovation in this world. There is no such thing as risk-free innovation. Oftentimes, managing risk down to zero is the biggest risk.</p><p>When the battle of Red Cliff was fought, I believe Cao Cao’s act of connecting all the ships together was the first instance of an aircraft carrier, in China and the world, but after a fire burned it all down, for a thousand years, the Chinese people didn't dare to think about it again. Once they thought about that fire, who still wanted to make a bigger ship, who could still have this kind of system-level thinking?</p><p>Seven or eight years ago, also in Shanghai, I mentioned this concept of Internet-powered finance. We have always emphasized that Internet-powered finance must have three core elements: first, it must have rich data; second, it must have risk control technology based on rich big data; and third, it must have a credit-based system built on big data.</p><p>Using these three criteria to evaluate, we can see that P2P is not Internet-powered finance at all, but today we cannot negate the innovation that the Internet has brought to finance just because of P2P. In fact, let's think about it, how can there be thousands of Internet-powered finance companies in China within a few years? Shouldn't we examine what gave birth to thousands of “Internet-powered finance”, the so-called P2P companies?</p><p>Today, it's really difficult to regulate ourselves; it's hard to conduct regulation everywhere around the globe. Innovation mainly comes from the marketplace, innovation comes from the grassroots, innovation comes from young people. Regulatory challenges are getting bigger and bigger. In fact, <em>jian </em>[editor's note: English word is “supervision”, the first character in the word for “regulation” in Chinese] and <em>guan </em>[editor's note: English word is “management”, the second character in the word for “regulation” in Chinese] are two different things. "Supervision" means watching you as you develop and paying attention to your development. “Management” means intervening when there is a problem or when there is a foreseeable problem.</p><p>We are very good at “management”, but our “supervision” ability is sorely lacking.</p><p>Good innovation is not afraid of regulation, but is afraid of being subjected to yesterday's way to regulate. We cannot use the way to manage a railway station to manage an airport. We cannot use yesterday's way to manage the future.</p><p>"Supervision" and "management" are not the same, “policies” and “documents” are also not the same. This isn’t allowed, that isn’t allowed, those are all called “documents”. Policy …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

  A toolbox implements the feature and provides many directives that
  can be used for compile time configuration and tuning, code

      <p>This is the official announcement for the release of Micro 3.0 better known as M3O - a platform for cloud native development. 
Our 3.0 release is a major refactor and consolidation of the existing tooling into something that addresses the entire workflow 
of build, run, manage and consume all from the developers perspective.</p>

<p>Read on to learn more or go straight to the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/releases/latest">latest release</a>. 
Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/">m3o.com</a> for the hosted offering.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Micro focuses on developer productivity for the backend. It’s clear that the Cloud has become infinitely more complex 
over the past few years. Micro attempts to create order out of that chaos by distilling it all down to a handful of 
primitives for distributed systems development.</p>

<p>Why should you care? If you’re reading this you’ve no doubt encountered the tedious nature of infrastructure management, 
wrangling a kubernetes cluster on AWS or the thousands of things you need to do to cobble together a platform before 
starting to build a product. We think we’ve nailed the solution for that just as Android did for Mobile. Keep reading 
if you want to find out more.</p>

<h2 id="quick-flashback">Quick Flashback</h2>

<p>Micro started out as a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2016/03/20/micro.html">toolkit for microservices</a> development, 
incorporating an api gateway, web dashboard and cli to interact with services built using a Go RPC framework. 
Back then it felt like getting anyone to buy into PaaS again was going to be a losing battle. So we chose 
to write single purpose tools around an RPC framework thinking it might allow people to adopt it piece by piece 
until they saw the need for a platform. It was really straight forward right until it wasn’t.</p>

<p>There was a simple Go framework plus some surrounding 
components to query and interact with them, but like any long lived project, the complexity grew as we 
tried to solve for that platform experience that just couldn’t be done with a swiss army knife. The repo 
exploded with a number of independent libraries. To the creator its obvious what these are all for but to 
the user there is nothing but cognitive overload.</p>

<p>In 2019 we went through a <a href="https://micro.mu/blog/2019/06/10/the-great-consolidation.html">consolidation</a> of all those libraries 
which helped tremendously but there was still always one outstanding question. What’s the difference between 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">micro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">go-micro</a>? It’s a good 
question and one we’ve covered before. We saw go-micro as a framework and micro as a toolkit but these 
words were basically empty and meaningless because multiple projects working in coordination really need a 
crisp story that makes sense and we didn’t have one.</p>

<p>In 2020 we’re looking to rectify that but let’s first let’s talk about platforms.</p>

<h2 id="paas-in-2020">PaaS in 2020</h2>

<p>5 years ago the world exploded with a proliferation of “cloud native” tooling as containers and 
container orchestration took centre stage. More specifically, Docker and Kubernetes redefined the 
technology landscape along with a more conscious move towards building software in the cloud.</p>

<p>Micro took a forward looking view even as far back as 2015. It was clear distributed systems and cloud native 
was going to become the dominant model for backend services development over the coming years but, what wasn’t clear 
is just how long we’d spend wrangling all sorts tools like docker, kubernetes, grpc, istio and everything else. 
It felt like we were rebuilding the stack and weren’t really ready to talk about development aspects of it all.</p>

<p>In fact at that time, people mostly wanted to kick the tyres on all these tools and piece something together. 
Running kubernetes yourself became all the rage and even using service mesh as the holy grail for solving 
all your distributed systems problems. Many of us have come to realise while all of this tech is fun 
it’s not actually solving development problems.</p>

<p>We’ve gotten to the point of managed kubernetes and even things like Google Cloud Run or DigitalOcean App 
Platform, but none of these things are helping with a development model for a cloud native era. Our 
frustrations with the existing developer experience have grown and Micro felt like something that 
could solve for all that, but only if we took a drastic step to overhaul it.</p>

<p>We think PaaS 3.0 is not just about running your container or even your source code but something that 
encapsulates the entire developer experience including a model for writing code for the cloud. Based on that 
Micro 3.0 aka M3O is a platform for cloud native development.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-cloud-native">What even is Cloud Native?</h2>

<p>What is cloud native? What does it mean to build for the cloud? What is a cloud service?</p>

<p>Cloud native is basically a descriptive term for something that was built to run in the cloud. That’s it. It’s not 
magic, it might sound like a buzzword, but the reality is it simply means, that piece of software was built 
to run in the cloud. How does that differ from the way we used to build before? Well the idea behind the cloud 
is that its ephemeral, scalable and everything can be accessed via an API.</p>

<p>Our expectation for services running in the cloud is that they’re mostly stateless, leveraging external services 
for the persistence, that they are identified by name rather than IP address and they themselves provide an 
API that can be consumed by multiple clients such as web, mobile and cli or other services.</p>

<p>Cloud native applications are horizontally scalable and operate within domain boundaries that divide them as 
separate apps which communicate over the network via their APIs rather than as one monolithic entity. 
We think cloud services require a fundamentally different approach to software creation and why Micro 3.0 
was designed with this in mind.</p>

<h2 id="micro-30-aka-m3o">Micro 3.0 aka M3O</h2>

<p>Micro 3.0 (M3O) reimagines Micro as a platform for cloud native development. What does that mean? Well we think of 
it as PaaS 3.0, a complete solution for source to running and beyond. Micro has moved from just being a Go 
framework to incorporating a standalone server and hosted platform. Our hosted offering is called 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>, a hat tip to Micro 3.0 or M[icr]o, whichever way you want to see it.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it. What Git is to GitHub, Micro is to the M3O platform. Let’s dig into it.</p>

<p>Micro 3.0 includes the following.</p>

<h3 id="server">Server</h3>

<p>The server is our abstraction for cloud infrastructure and underlying systems you might need for writing 
distributed systems. The server encapsulates all of these concerns as gRPC services which you can 
query via any language. The goal here is to say developers don’t really need to be thinking about infrastructure 
but what they do need is design patterns and primitives for building distributed systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.mu/images/micro-3.0.png"></p>

<p>The server includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong>: Auth whether its authentication or authorization is part of the system. Create JWT tokens, define access rules, use one system to govern everything in a simple and straight forward manner. Whether it’s for a user or a service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Dynamic config management allows you to store relevant config that needs to be updated without having to restart services. Throw API keys and business logic related configuration into the secure config service and let your services pick up the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Key-Value Storage</strong>: We’re focused on best practices for microservices development which means keeping services mostly stateless. To do this we’re providing persistent storage on the platform. Key-Value allows you to rapidly write code and store data in the format you care about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Event Streaming</strong>: Distributed systems are fundamentally in need of an event driven architecture to breakdown the tight dependencies between them. Using event streaming and pubsub allows you to publish and subscribe to relevant events async.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Registry</strong>: Micro and M3O bake in service discovery so you can browse a directory of services to explore your service APIs and enable you to query services by name. Micro is all about microservices and multi-service development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Service Network</strong>: Because you don’t want to have to resolve those service names to addresses and deal with the load balancing aspect, the server bakes in a “service mesh” which will handle your inter-service requests (as gRPC) and route to the 
appropriate instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identity Proxy</strong>: We include a separate identity proxy for external requests using gRPC via the CLI and other means. This enables you to query from your local machine or anywhere else using valid auth credentials and have it seamlessly work as if 
you were in the platform itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Finally there’s an API gateway that automatically exposes your services to the outside world over HTTP. Internally writing service to service using gRPC makes sense, but at the end of the day we want to build APIs consumed from clients via HTTP.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>

<p>The server provides inter-service communication and two means of external communication with a HTTP API and gRPC proxy but that 
experience is made much better when there’s user experience on the client side that works. Right now we’ve got two ways of doing this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Line</strong>: The CLI provides a convenient and simple way to talk to the server via gRPC requests through the proxy. 
The most convenient commands are builtin but every service you write also gets beautiful dynamic generated commands 
for each endpoint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gRPC SDKs</strong>: Every service in the server is accessible via gRPC. We’re code generating clients for the server itself 
so you can access them from any language. What this enables is a wide array of experiences on the client side without 
having to handcraft libraries for each language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Interface</strong>: Coming soon is a dynamically generated web interface that creates a simple query mechanism through a 
browser for any of your services. We’ve got a http api, gRPC proxy and command line interface but feel like the browser 
could use some love too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>

<p>One thing we really understood from our time working on go-micro was that the developer experience …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Last week I ran a poll on Twitter to see what people considered with respect to the meaning of ‘pwd’ in Unix and Linux systems. The results were varied, for perhaps good reason.</em></p>

<p>At the end of Oct 2020 I ran a <a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1322567992551624705">brief poll on Twitter</a>, on which 82 people voted. Here’s that poll, and the results. They’re quite mixed, which at first might seem surprising. But there are reasons for that, as we’ll find out.</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/twitter-poll-pwd.png" alt="Poll on Twitter: &quot;Fun Saturday afternoon shell poll. In Unix (and Linux), what do you think the P in $PWD (or pwd) stand for?&quot;"></p>

<p><strong>Print working directory</strong></p>

<p>The most popular option was “print working directory”. At first sight it seems logical: “print out the current working directory, i.e. where I am right now”. Moreover, the description in various versions of the manual for <code>pwd</code> help to drive home that notion. Typically we see sentences like “<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/pwd">print name of current/working directory</a>” or “<a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/pwd">print the current directory</a>”.</p>

<p>But there are lots of commands that print stuff, and are described in that way too. Take the <code>id</code> command. Here’s what one man page says: “<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/id.1.html">print real and effective user and group IDs</a>”. There’s “print” again. But the command isn’t <code>pid</code>, it’s <code>id</code>. When you think about it, many, many commands in Unix send information to STDOUT, i.e. to the terminal. That’s sort of the point of many of them.</p>

<p>This time arguably only superficially definitive, it would seem, the Wikipedia entry states, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd">page for <code>pwd</code></a>: “the pwd command (print working directory) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”. As if to underline the hopeful authority of this statement, there are five (!) footnotes that supposedly link to resources that back this up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the first footnote points to a Wayback Machine copy of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050520231659/http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol1.pdf">UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL - Seventh Edition, Volume 1 - January, 1979</a>, wherein there are actually zero references to <code>pwd</code> being short for “print working directory”:</p>

<p><img src="https://qmacro.org/content/images/2020/11/programmers-manual-pwd.png" alt="excerpt from UNIX PROGRAMMERS MANUAL on pwd"></p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but this historic document carries more weight for me than other sources I’ve come across, and it only serves here to undermine the credibility of the Wikipedia entry.</p>

<p>The rest of the footnote links seem dubious at best, except for the one pointing to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#pwd-invocation">GNU Coreutils manual on pwd</a> which has it as “print working directory”. But everything else I’ve seen so far makes me think that this is a misunderstanding that has spread for obvious and innocent reasons. In addition, the one footnote in the Wikipedia page that is not used to back this claim up is a pointer to <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pwd.html">The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition’s information on pwd</a>, which almost seems like it’s actually avoiding using the word “print” at all: “return working directory name” … “The pwd utility shall write to standard output an absolute pathname of the current working directory, which does not contain the filenames dot or dot-dot.”. Very specific, very not-print.</p>

<p>So I’m thinking that “print working directory” isn’t what <code>pwd</code> stands for. In fact, “print working directory” may be common to some man pages, but on this macOS machine, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> heritage, we have, instead: “pwd – return working directory name”. Moreover, it goes on to say “The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output”.</p>

<p><strong>Pathname of working directory</strong></p>

<p>So perhaps it really is “pathname of working directory”. That would, at least to me, make more sense. Not only does it eschew the redundancy of “print”, it also is more specific about the output - if I’m in <code>/home/dja/</code> for example, then invoking pwd will tell me that, i.e. where I am, including the whole path, and not just <code>dja</code>:</p>



<p><strong>Process working directory</strong></p>

<p>As for the other options, I do favour “process working directory”, mostly because it makes a lot of sense to me; every process in Unix has the concept of a current working directory, and that’s exactly what I’m asking for when I’m in my shell process and enter <code>pwd</code> - there’s a part in the video <a href="https://youtu.be/hgFBRZmwpSM?t=165">Unix terminals and shells</a> that explains this very well.</p>

<p>I’d love to be able to point to some old Unix sources that definitively explain the answer, but unfortunately that search has come up with very little - the <code>pwd</code> source in both the <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/source/s2/pwd.c">5th</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yisooan/unix-v6/blob/master/source/s2/pwd.c">6th</a> Editions of Unix shed no light on this whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Present working directory</strong></p>

<p>What about “present working directory”? Well, that option seems to have legs, in the form of the Korn shell. While <a href="https://northstar-www.dartmouth.edu/doc/solaris-forte/ipe-help/dbx/dbx88cc.html">one source</a> implies that the answer might well be “pathname of current working directory”, in that <code>pwd</code> just emits the value of the <code>$PWD</code> environment variable (and a variable called “print working directory” makes no sense at all) … it would seem that in ksh-land, at least, “present working directory” is what <code>pwd</code> represents. Take, for example, the <a href="https://osr507doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.C/ksh.C.html">ksh man page</a> which states “PWD - The present working directory set by the cd command”.</p>

<p>There’s a ton of discussion, both direct and indirect, on this very question. Take for example these two entries in the Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange forum: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399026/etymology-of-pwd">Etymology of $PWD</a> and <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174990/what-is-pwd-vs-current-working-directory">What is $PWD? (vs current working directory)</a>. Of course, perhaps the definitive answer will never be found, as computing history is nothing if not varied and prone to forking.</p>

<p><strong>Multics and print_wdir</strong></p>

<p>Talking of history, we could go further back to pre-Unix roots, in the form of Multics, which indirectly gave rise to Unix (originally “Unics”). In the <a href="https://multicians.org/multics-commands.html">list of Multics Commands</a>, we see, nestled amongst other similarly named commands, something that jumps out at us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>print_mail (pm)	display mail in a mailbox
print_messages (pm)	display interactive messages in a mailbox
print_motd (pmotd)	display message of the day (source)
print_proc_auth (ppa)	display process's sensitivity level and compartments
print_request_types (prt)	display list of I/O daemon request types
print_search_paths (psp)	display search paths
print_search_rules (psr)	display ready messages
print_wdir (pwd)	display working directory
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s <code>pwd</code>, and in fact, just like its sibling <code>pmotd</code>, for example, which is short for <code>print_motd</code>, it’s short for <code>print_wdir</code>. Now, given the context of the original poll being set to Unix and Linux, perhaps we must discount this information. But as someone who is fascinated with Unix history in general - how can I?</p>

<p>I guess there are few things to conclude. The history is rich and diverse, and maybe we’ll never know for sure. Perhaps, in fact, the answer will depend on whom we ask. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter … but to those who delight in minutiae, it’s a fun topic worth exploring.</p>

November 10, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every now and then I get questions on how to work with git in a smooth way when developing, bug-fixing or extending curl – or how I do it. After all, I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/10/26/working-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="14901">work on open source full time</a> which means I have very frequent interactions with git (and GitHub). Simply put, I work with git all day long. Ordinary days, I issue git commands several hundred times.</p>



<p>I have a very simple approach and way of working with git in curl. This is how it works.</p>



<h2>command line</h2>



<p>I use git almost exclusively from the command line in a terminal. To help me see which branch I’m working in, I have this little bash helper script.</p>



<pre>brname () {
  a=$(<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2&gt;/dev/null</code>)
  if [ -n "$a" ]; then
    echo " [$a]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}
PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(brname)$ "</pre>



<p>That gives me a prompt that shows username, host name, the current working directory and the current checked out git branch.</p>



<p>In addition: I use Debian’s <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/bash-completion/-/blob/master/README.md">bash command line completion</a> for git which is also really handy. It allows me to use tab to complete things like git commands and branch names. </p>



<h2>git config</h2>



<p>I of course also have my customized <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to provide me with some convenient aliases and settings. My most commonly used git aliases are:</p>


<pre title="">st = status --short -uno
ci = commit
ca = commit --amend
caa = commit -a --amend
br = branch
co = checkout
df = diff
lg = log -p --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit
lgg = log --pretty=fuller --abbrev-commit --stat
up = pull --rebase
latest = log @^{/RELEASE-NOTES:.synced}..
</pre>


<p>The ‘latest’ one is for listing all changes done to curl since the most recent RELEASE-NOTES “sync”. The others should hopefully be rather self-explanatory.</p>



<p>The config also sets <code>gpgsign = true</code>, enables mailmap and a few other things.</p>



<h2>master is clean and working</h2>



<p>The main curl development is done in the single <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl/curl</a> git repository (primarily hosted on GitHub). We keep the master branch the bleeding edge development tree and we work hard to always keep that working and functional. We do our releases off the master branch when that day comes (every eight weeks) and we provide “<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/">daily snapshots</a>” from that branch, put together – yeah – daily.</p>



<p>When merging fixes and features into master, we avoid merge commits and use rebases and fast-forward as much as possible. This makes the branch very easy to browse, understand and work with – as it is 100% linear.</p>



<h2>Work on a fix or feature</h2>



<p>When I start something new, like work on a bug or trying out someone’s patch or similar, I first create a local branch off master and work in that. That is, I don’t work directly in the master branch. Branches are easy and quick to do and there’s no reason to shy away from having loads of them!</p>



<p>I typically name the branch prefixed with my GitHub user name, so that when I push them to the server it is noticeable who is the creator (and I can use the same branch name locally as I do remotely).</p>



<pre>$ git checkout -b bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<p>Once I’ve reached somewhere, I commit to the branch. It can then end up one or more commits before I consider myself “done for now” with what I was set out to do.</p>



<p>I try not to leave the tree with any uncommitted changes – like if I take off for the day or even just leave for food or an extended break. This puts the repository in a state that allows me to easily switch over to another branch  when I get back – should I feel the need to. Plus, it’s better to commit and explain the change <em>before</em> the break rather than having to recall the details again when coming back.</p>



<h2>Never stash</h2>



<p>“git stash” is therefore not a command I ever use. I rather create a new branch and commit the (temporary?) work in there as a potential new line of work.</p>



<h2>Show it off and get reviews</h2>



<p>Yes I am the lead developer of the project but I still maintain the same work flow as everyone else. All changes, except the most minuscule ones, are done as pull requests on GitHub.</p>



<p>When I’m happy with the functionality in my local branch. When the bug seems to be fixed or the feature seems to be doing what it’s supposed to do and the test suite runs fine locally.</p>



<p>I then clean up the commit series with “<code>git rebase -i</code>” (or if it is a single commit I can instead use just “<code>git commit --amend</code>“).</p>



<p>The commit series should be a set of logical changes that are related to this change and not any more than necessary, but kept separate if they are separate. Each commit also gets its own proper commit message. Unrelated changes should be split out into its own separate branch and subsequent separate pull request.</p>



<pre>git push origin bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</pre>



<h2>Make the push a pull request</h2>



<p>On GitHub, I then make the newly pushed branch into a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pulls">pull request</a> (aka “a PR”). It will then become visible in the list of pull requests on the site for the curl source repository, it will be announced in the #curl IRC channel and everyone who follows the repository on GitHub will be notified accordingly.</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, a pull request kicks of a flood of CI jobs that will build and test the code in numerous different combinations and on several platforms, and the results of those tests will trickle in over the coming hours. When I write this, we have around 90 different CI jobs – per pull request – and something like 8 different code analyzers will scrutinize the change to see if there’s any obvious flaws in there.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-05-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png"><img loading="lazy" width="2686" height="1510" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-05-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>CI jobs per platform over time. Graph snapped on November 5, 2020</figcaption></figure>



<h2>A branch in the actual curl/curl repo</h2>



<p>Most contributors who would work on curl would not do like me and make the branch in the curl repository itself, but would rather do them in their own forked version instead. The difference isn’t that big and I <em>could</em> of course also do it that way.</p>



<h2>After push, switch branch</h2>



<p>As it will take some time to get the full CI results from the PR to come in (generally a few hours), I switch over to the next branch with work on my agenda. On a normal work-day I can easily move over ten different branches, polish them and submit updates in their respective pull-requests.</p>



<p>I can go back to the&nbsp;master branch again with ‘<code>git checkout master</code>‘ and there I can “<code>git pull</code>” to get everything from upstream – like when my fellow developers have pushed stuff in the mean time.</p>



<h2>PR comments or CI alerts</h2>



<p>If a reviewer or a CI job find a mistake in one of my PRs, that becomes visible on GitHub and I get to work to handle it. To either fix the bug or discuss with the reviewer what the better approach might be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, flaky CI jobs is a part of life so very often there ends up one or two red markers in the list of CI jobs that can be ignored as the test failures in them are there due to problems in the setup and not because of actual mistakes in the PR…</p>



<p>To get back to my branch for that PR again, I “<code>git checkout bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code>“, and fix the issues.</p>



<p>I normally start out by doing follow-up commits that repair the immediate mistake and push them on the branch:</p>



<pre>git push origin <code>bagder/my-new-stuff-or-bugfix</code></pre>



<p>If the number of fixup commits gets large, or if the follow-up fixes aren’t small, I usually end up doing a squash to reduce the number of commits into a smaller, simpler set, and then force-push them to the branch.</p>



<p>The reason for that is to make the patch series easy to review, read and understand. When a commit series has too many commits that changes the previous commits, it becomes hard to review.</p>



<h2>Ripe to merge?</h2>



<p>When the pull request is ripe for merging (independently of who authored it), I switch over to the master branch again and I merge the pull request’s commits into it. In special cases I cherry-pick specific commits from the branch instead. When all the stuff has been yanked into master properly that should be there, I push the changes to the remote.</p>



<p>Usually, and especially if the pull request wasn’t done by me, I also go over the commit messages and polish them somewhat before I push everything. Commit messages should follow our style and mention not only which PR that it closes but also which issue it fixes and properly give credit to the bug reporter and all the helpers – using the right syntax so that our automatic tools can pick them up correctly!</p>



<p>As already mentioned above, I merge fast-forward or rebased into master. No merge commits.</p>



<h2>Never merge with GitHub!</h2>



<p>There’s a button GitHub that says “rebase and merge” that could theoretically be used for merging pull requests. I <em>never</em> use that (and if I could, I’d disable/hide it). The reasons are simply:</p>



<ol><li>I don’t feel that I have the proper control of the commit message(s)</li><li>I can’t select to squash a subset of the commits, only all or nothing</li><li>I often want to cleanup the author parts too before push, which the UI doesn’t allow</li></ol>



<p>The downside with not using the merge button is that the message in the  PR says “closed by [hash]” instead of “merged in…” which causes confusion to a fair amount of users who don’t realize it means that it actually means the same thing! I consider this is a (long-standing) GitHub UX flaw.</p>



<h2>Post merge</h2>



<p>If the branch has nothing to be kept around more, I delete the local branch again with “<code>git branch -d [name]</code>” and I remove it remotely too since it was completely merged there’s no reason to keep the work version left.</p>



<p>At any given point in time, I have some 20-30 different local branches alive using this approach so things I work on over time all live in their own branches and also submissions from various people that haven’t been merged into master yet exist in branches of various maturity levels. Out of those local branches, the number of concurrent pull requests I have in progress can be somewhere between just a few up to ten, twelve something.</p>

</span><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>
Michael J. Mahon – July 26, 2008<br>
Revised – September 23, 2015</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/CrateII.jpg" width="500" height="612"></p>

</span><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Introduction</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2"><p>
In 2004 I built the first <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/Applecrate.html">AppleCrate</a>, an 8-board system, as an inexpensive, easy to program
vehicle for experiments in parallel programming—a kind of "blade server" for the Apple II, if
you will!  AppleCrate I (at the time I didn't realize that it was number "I" ;-) was great fun, and it
enabled some very interesting experiments, but over time I discovered some of its shortcomings.</p>

<p>First and foremost, since the boards were supported by only two edges and not clamped in place, it
was relatively fragile and hard to transport.  Second, I had come across situations in which more
than 8 slave processors would have been useful.  Third, my arrangement for collecting audio signals
synthesized by the slaves was quite makeshift and delivered sound with lots of digital "hash"
as background noise.  And finally, the original AppleCrate made no provision for plugging I/O cards
into any of its boards, so it had to be hosted by a separate Apple II, adding to the problem of
transporting it for demonstrations.</p>

<p>The AppleCrate II is designed to be significantly improved in all of the areas that were
problems for the AppleCrate I.</p>

<b></b></span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Description</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>The AppleCrate II is made from 17 Enhanced Apple //e main boards.  (Fifteen of these boards were
obtained in the same eBay auction that netted the eight unenhanced boards for the original AppleCrate.)
Because they are enhanced ROMs, the original NadaNet boot ROM code would not fit and a new
boot protocol had to be developed, as described below.</p>

<p>Instead of mounting the cards vertically in a frame, as in the original, I decided to mount them
horizontally in a stack secured with standoffs—3/4" long hexagonal rods, each with a screw protruding from
one end and a tapped hole in the other.  The AppleCrate II has nine "columns" of these standoffs—six
metal columns at the back and corners of the boards and three nylon columns interior to the boards
to add stiffness, as shown in the photo below at the 2-board construction stage:</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/TwoBoards.jpg" width="800" height="554"></p>

<p>This "hi-rise" construction makes the "stack" quite rigid and sturdy, while eliminating the need
for a space-consuming exoskeleton.  It also has the advantage of leaving the top board unobstructed
so that I/O cards can be plugged in, allowing it to serve as the host machine for the AppleCrate.  (In fact,
I used 17 boards so that the top board can serve as master and leave 16 slave machines for parallel
programs.)</p>

<p>The Pushbutton 1 input and Annunciator 1 output bus wires and the AN2-to-PB2 GETID daisy chain wires are connected to
machined-pin sockets inserted into the 16-pin game port connector.  These connections support <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/NadaNet.html">NadaNet</a>,
which is the only signal connection between the boards.  The network adapter (described below) is shown
with its mounting bracket under what will be the third board.  The power bus card is supported by a
similar angle bracket, and the standoffs immediately beneath them are filed down to accomodate the
bracket thickness.</p>

<p>The boards are powered by a PC AT power supply.  The average power consumed by an Apple //e
board is about 4.2 watts, so the whole 17-board crate consumes only about 70 watts in total,
and both the AppleCrate and the power supply run only a few degrees above ambient temperature.</p>

<p>I decided to use #12 copper bus wires
to distribute power to all boards (visible on the right side of the first photo).  I would have preferred
a connectorized approach, but I could not come up with a connector scheme with a
reasonable mating/unmating force.  As a result, I decided to go with soldered power connections.
(It's a good thing that Apple //e's are so reliable, since replacing one in the middle of the
stack would be relatively difficult!)</p>

<p>The top board is used as the "master" machine with I/O cards and an external keyboard plugged into it.
The Master boots the 16 slave Apples in the AppleCrate II and uses them to run parallel programs.
Once they have been booted and started, they can run independently of the master—though they are clearly
I/O-constrained!</p>

<b></b></span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Indicators</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>It has proven useful to have some real-time indication of each board's activity.  The stock board contains a
red "power" LED (at the right) and a red "speaker" LED at the left.  Both are easily visible from the back of the
boards (the "front" of the AppleCrate).  The function of the power LED is fixed, but the speaker LED is usable
as an indicator that software running on the board can operate, just by toggling the speaker.  For example,
printing a "beep"—CHR$(07)—causes the speaker LED to flash for 0.1 second, and can be used to indicate some
condition in the software.  (The speaker LED will not light when a speaker is installed, but AppleCrate
boards have no speakers attached.)</p>

<p>Although the Applecrate network interface described below incorporates an LED to show global network activity,
it is very useful to be able to see when any particular board is sending on the network.  This need is met by
using the PDL 3 timer to "stretch" each packet send operation into a visible flash of a green rectangular LED.</p>

<p><img src="http://michaeljmahon.com/SendLED.jpg" width="762" height="263"></p>

<p>These photos show the modification made to the 558 timer chip, in which a 267-ohm resistor (just what I
had handy—any value between 220 and 560 ohms is fine) is connected
between pins 5 and 8, and the "send" signalling LED is connected between pin 8 and ground, with pin 8 going to the
anode.  The rectangular LED is carefully pressed between the cassette input and output jacks.  On some boards,
the jacks were so close together that it was necessary to "shave" the upper plastic swage on the side of the input
jack with an Exacto knife to make room for the LED to press fit between them.  (Note that in these photos the red
wire connected to the anode of the LED has not yet been soldered.)</p>

</span><b><span face="Arial, helvetica"><p>Network Boot in NadaNet 3.x</p>
</span></b><span face="Arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p>Since AppleCrate machines have no I/O capabilities other than
the network, they must be booted from the network.  This requires that the ROMs on the boards be replaced with
EPROMs containing modified RESET code to perform the network boot.</p>

<p>As with the AppleCrate I, replacement of the self-test code was the easiest path, since it is self-contained,
contiguous, and is executed upon power-on reset if no keyboard is connected.  However, the Enhanced //e ROM contains
only $200 bytes of self-test code, just half the size of the unenhanced //e self-test, requiring a new
design for the network boot.</p>

<p>The AppleCrate I used an "active" boot protocol, in which each board enabled by the "GETID daisy chain" (connected from
AN2 of the previous machine to PB2 of the current machine) continuously sent GETID requests to ID 1, until it was assigned
a permanent ID and received a NadaNet boot image.  The complexity of this protocol, requiring both sending and receiving
packets over the network, resulted in a boot ROM requirement of almost $400 bytes—which fit in an <b>Unenhanced</b> //e ROM.</p>

<p>Since the <b>Enhanced</b> //e ROM has only $200 bytes available, a new "passive" boot protocol had to be devised.
The <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/PASSIVEBOOT.ROM.pdf">new ROM code</a> continuously monitors the network for a broadcast BOOTREQ control packet
containing  the load address and length of the immediately following boot code data.  When the boot image has been correctly
read from the network, control is passed to its starting address.  This passive boot code only needs to <b>read</b> packets from the
net, and so occupies just $190 bytes, which comfortably fits in place of the Enhanced //e ROM self-test code at $C600.</p>

<p>The new boot protocol capitalizes on the fact that boot code is sent as a broadcast transaction, so the
machines being booted do not need IDs to receive boot code.  A page of "second-stage boot" code is added at the
front of the slave machine boot image.  This code is given control immediately after the boot image is received, and,
when enabled by the "GETID daisy chain", it sends a GETID request to the machine that &amp;BOOTed it, making use of the
code in the full NadaNet boot image to do so (see the BOOT2 code in the <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/NADA.CRATE.pdf">NADA.CRATE</a>
listing for details).</p>

<p>The GETID daisy chain functions just as it did in the AppleCrate I.  The "first" machine is permanently enabled
by connecting its PB2 to ground.  AN2 of each machine is connected
to PB2 of the "next" machine.  The second-stage boot code running in each machine initially sets its AN2.
Then it waits until it sees its PB2 go low, enabling it to send its GETID request.  When its GETID is successful
it drops its AN2, enabling the next machine.  Then it clears its video display, writes a banner showing the
machine ID, and enters its server loop.</p>

<p>This results in permanent
IDs being assigned in the fixed order of the physical daisy chain, while allowing all ROMs to be identical.
An LED on the AppleCrate II NadaNet adapter board is wired to the last machine's AN2, so that when the last
machine drops its AN2, the red LED extinguishes, signalling that all machines have booted successfully.</p>

<p>When a network-booting machine is reset, it first checks the network state.  If the network is low (ZERO),
it performs a cold start.  If the network is being held high (ONE), it checks page 3 to see if it is being cold started or warm reset.  If it is
a warm reset, it re-enters its Server loop.  If it is a cold start, it initializes and enters the ROM boot code, again waiting
for a BOOTREQ packet.  (This approach has the advantage of reliably forcing a reboot on a power cycle, while
still permitting boards to be warm reset while holding the network high.)</p>

<p>As of NadaNet 3.1, all AppleCrate boot ROMs must be <a href="http://michaeljmahon.com/PASSIVEBOOT.ROM.pdf">NadaNet 3.x capable</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Interfaces in Go allow us to treat different types as the same data type temporarily. They are central to a Go programmers toolbelt and are often used improperly by new Go developers… leading to hard to read and buggy code. Let’s take a look at some of the best practices for Golang interfaces.</p>



<h2>Recap on Interfaces</h2>



<p>I often look to the standard library as an example of the way to write clean Go. The standard error interface is simple:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type error interface {
    Error() string
}</code></pre>



<p>The error interface encapsulates any type that has an <code>Error()</code> method defined on it. That method accepts no parameters, and returns a <em>string</em>. For example, let’s define a struct that represents a network problem:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type networkProblem struct {
	message string
	code    int
}</code></pre>



<p>Then we define an <code>Error()</code> method:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func (np networkProblem) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("network error! message: %s, code: %v", np.message, np.code)
}</code></pre>



<p>Now, we can use an instance of the <code>networkProblem</code> struct wherever an error is accepted.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func handleErr(err error) {
	fmt.Println(err.Error())
}

np := networkProblem{
	message: "we received a problem",
	code:    404,
}

handleErr(np)

// prints "network error! message: we received a problem, code: 404"</code></pre>



<h2>Keep Interfaces Small</h2>



<p>If there is only one piece of advice that you take away from this article, make it this: <strong>keep interfaces small!</strong> Interfaces are meant to define the <em>minimal</em> behavior necessary to accurately represent an idea or concept. </p>



<p>Here is an example from the standard <a aria-label="HTTP package (opens in a new tab)" href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#pkg-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HTTP package</a> of a larger interface that’s a good example of defining minimal behavior:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type File interface {
    io.Closer
    io.Reader
    io.Seeker
    Readdir(count int) ([]os.FileInfo, error)
    Stat() (os.FileInfo, error)
}</code></pre>



<p>Any type that satisfies the interface’s behaviors can be considered by the HTTP package as a <em>File</em>. This is convenient because the HTTP package doesn’t need to know if it’s dealing with a file on disk, a network buffer, or a simple <code>[]byte</code>. </p>



<h2>Interfaces Should Have No Knowledge of Satisfying Types </h2>



<p>An interface should define what is necessary for other types to classify as a member of that interface. They shouldn’t be aware of any types that happen to satisfy the interface at design time.</p>



<p>For example, let’s assume we are building an interface to describe the components necessary to define a car.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type car interface {
	GetColor() string
	GetSpeed() int
	IsFiretruck() bool
}</code></pre>



<p><code>GetColor()</code> and <code>GetSpeed()</code> make perfect sense, they are methods confined to the scope of a car. <code>IsFiretruck()</code> is an anti-pattern. We are forcing all cars to declare whether or not they are firetrucks. In order for this pattern to make any amount of sense, we would need a whole list of possible subtypes. <code>IsPickup()</code>, <code>IsSedan()</code>, <code>IsTank()</code>… where does it end??</p>



<p>Instead, the developer should have relied on the native functionality of <a href="https://yourbasic.org/golang/type-assertion-switch/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">type assertion</a> to derive the underlying type when given an instance of the <strong>car</strong> interface. Or, if a sub-interface is needed, it can be defined as:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type firetruck interface {
	car
	HoseLength() int
}</code></pre>



<p>Which inherits the required methods from <code>car</code> and adds one additional required method to make the car a <code>firetruck</code>.</p>



<h2>Interfaces Are Not Classes</h2>



<ul><li>Interfaces are not classes, they are slimmer.</li><li>Interfaces don’t have constructors or deconstructors that require that data is created or destroyed.</li><li>Interfaces aren’t hierarchical by nature, though there is syntactic sugar to create interfaces that happen to be supersets of other interfaces.</li><li>Interfaces define function signatures, but not underlying behavior. Making an interface often won’t <a aria-label="DRY (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DRY</a> up your code in regards to struct methods. For example, if five types satisfy the error interface, they all need their own version of the <code>Error()</code> function.</li></ul>

US President was illegitimately elected with the help of foreign
interference, it should surprise no one that the 2020 presidential
election is mired in similar claims of illegitimacy. This time around,
the people calling foul play aren't blaming Russians for the outcome:
they're blaming good old fashioned <a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/report/where-theres-smoke-theres-fire-100000-stolen-votes-chicago">election fraud of the kind that
put 63 people in Chicago behind bars following the 1982 presidential
election</a>. Or
the 2018 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/north-carolina-9th-fraud-board-orders-new-election/583369/">fraud in North Carolina's 9th congressional district that
caused the election result to be thrown
out</a>.</p>
<p>But proven cases of election fraud are a lot rarer than vague
allegations. Since the election, there have been a lot of vague
allegations of election fraud being thrown around on social media. And
like most politically motivated claims on social media, they have been
widely signal-boosted without much attempt to demonstrate if they're
true or not. I saw a lot of these, and some of them actually had data
sources attached to them. Being a software engineer at a data-sharing
startup, I got curious. I decided to dig into a specific claim and see
for myself if there might be any truth to it.</p>
<p><strong>Publication day update: I saw another claim about Pennsylvania's
mail-in ballots this morning, and checked it out. Unlike the first
claim, this one is corroborated by the data provided by the
Pennsylvania Department of State. <a href="#Update">Skip to this update</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This person claims to have analyzed <a href="https://data.pa.gov/Government-Efficiency-Citizen-Engagement/2020-General-Election-Mail-Ballot-Requests-Departm/mcba-yywm/data">data on mail ballots published by
the Pennsylvania Department of
State</a>,
and found that over a million people over the age of 85 had returned
mail-in ballots in that state. Since there are only about 230 thousand
people that old in Pennsylvania, that certainly sounds fishy! So let's
get to the bottom of this. I downloaded the PA ballot data as a CSV
file and got to work.</p>

    <span>and</span> ballot_returned_date <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But to write that query, I had to import the data first. Anyone who
has ever worked with data knows this is much harder than it should be.</p>
<p>To start, I had to give the data a primary key, which is currently
required by Dolt (although we're working on fixing that). The easiest
way to do this was with a quick and dirty perl script:</p>
<div data-language="perl"><pre><code><span>my</span> <span>$i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>"$i,"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>print</span> <span>$_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>$i</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The script just puts an incrementing integer ID onto the front of
every row in the CSV file it's given. I ran it like so:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% perl id.pl <span>\</span>
    <span>&lt;</span> 2020_General_Election_Mail_Ballot_Requests_Department_of_State.csv
    <span>&gt;</span> 2020_pa.csv</code></pre></div>
<p>This gives me a schema that Dolt can import. To automate its creation,
I tried to use the <code>dolt schema import</code> command to divine it
automatically, which would save me a lot of typing. Unfortunately, it
thought that all the date columns were actually just strings.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt schema <span>import</span> -c --pks<span>=</span><span>"id"</span> pa 2020_pa.csv
CREATE TABLE <span><span>`</span>pa<span>`</span></span> <span>(</span>
  <span><span>`</span>County_Name<span>`</span></span> longtext NOT NULL,

  <span><span>`</span>Date_of_Birth<span>`</span></span> longtext NOT NULL,
  <span><span>`</span>Mail_Application_Type<span>`</span></span> longtext NOT NULL,

<span>)</span> <span>ENGINE</span><span>=</span>InnoDB DEFAULT <span>CHARSET</span><span>=</span>utf8mb4<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because all the dates provided by the Pennsylvania Department
of State were formatted in that peculiar American style that much of
the software in the world just refuses to work with: <code>MM/DD/YYYY</code>.</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>(Note that as crazy as America is in this decision, Canada manages to
be even worse somehow)</p>
<p>So I had to modify this schema by hand to change the types, and to
change the nullability of these columns. Not a huge deal. But of
course, importing the data failed for the same reason.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt table <span>import</span> -u pa 2020_pa.csv
Rows Processed: <span>0</span>, Additions: <span>0</span>, Modifications: <span>0</span>, Had No Effect: <span>0</span>

value <span>"09/26/2020"</span> can<span>'t be converted to time.Time
These can be ignored using the '</span>--continue'</code></pre></div>
<p>But being a software engineer on the open-source project you're trying
to use has its advantages: I knew right where to change the code to
make the date processing logic more forgiving. I also <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/1006">filed an issue
to fix this for
everybody</a>.</p>
<p>With those changes, my import finally completed successfully.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt table <span>import</span> -u pa 2020_pa.csv
Rows Processed: <span>3098705</span>, Additions: <span>3098705</span>, Modifications: <span>0</span>, Had No Effect: <span>0</span>
Import completed successfully.</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, I could run my query!</p>

<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>pa_voters<span>&gt;</span> <span>select</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>from</span> pa 
    <span>where</span> date_of_birth <span>&lt;</span> <span>'1935-11-05'</span>

<span>|</span> <span>126766</span>   <span>|</span>
<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So it turns out: a million extremely elderly people did not return
mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. About 126,000 did. This is a turnout
of around 50% for this age bracket, totally plausible (and actually
kind of low for this year).</p>

<p>So what gives? It's easy to come up with explanations for why so many
people accepted this wild claim at face value. But what about the
person propagating it? Were they simply lying?</p>
<p>I don't think so. The tweet has since been deleted so I can't
demonstrate it, but the poster seemed sincere in his analysis. He just
got it wrong. And from what I could tell, a big reason he got it wrong
is that he used Excel to import and analyze a 446MB, 3 million row
CSV file.</p>

<p>Excel is an amazing piece of software, and it's responsible for a
truly mind-boggling fraction of business and data analysis
workloads. But it has grown into these roles in a very haphazard and
at times reluctant fashion. When you throw certain kinds or magnitudes
of data at it, like a half gigabyte of text with 3 million rows, it
doesn't always work right.</p>
<p>Or, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about and it did work right!
Maybe the guy just sorted the spreadsheet by date of birth, it worked
perfectly, and he read the row number wrong. But my claim is that it
doesn't actually matter. The point is that we can never know, because
the analysis he performed is not reproducible or sharable. It's
forever lost in time, like tears in the rain.</p>

<p>We built Dolt because we think that the way we share data on the
internet is broken. <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2019-12-06-the-history-of-data-exchange/">We're stuck mailing zip files of CSV files around
like it's
1975</a>. And
once you get one of these files, most of your work is still ahead of
you. As a rule, it's not easy to import non-trivial CSV data in a
usable form. Industry research indicates that professional <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-3a5e293a5114">data
scientists spend nearly 80% of their time finding and cleaning
datasets</a>.
Eliminate this janitorial work, and every data scientist becomes five
times as effective overnight.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where the data from the Pennsylvania Department of
State was <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/pa_mail_ballots_2020">already distributed in Dolt
format</a>. Not
only is the data 1/3 the size of the uncompressed CSV file, it arrives
in a fully usable form: there's no import process, no trying to figure
out what the types of the columns are, whether they're nullable,
etc. You just run one command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt clone dolthub/pa_mail_ballots_2020</code></pre></div>
<p>... and you have all the data, ready to start querying immediately. If
the data is updated in the future, you can get the latest copy with
one more command.</p>

<p>If I'm a budding amateur electoral fraud analyst with a hot scoop I
want to share with my 4chan Pepe buddies, I can <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-02-28-announcing-saved-queries/">save my analysis as a
query that then travels alongside the
database</a>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt sql -q <span>\</span>
    <span>"select count(*) from pa where date_of_birth &lt; '1935-11-05' and ballot_returned_date is not null;"</span> <span>\</span>
    -s <span>"PA voters over 85"</span>
+----------+
<span>|</span> COUNT<span>(</span>*<span>)</span> <span>|</span>
+----------+
<span>|</span> <span>126766</span>   <span>|</span>
+----------+</code></pre></div>
<p>Now when my fellow election sleuths pull the database, they can verify
or expand on my work with a single command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>% dolt sql -x <span>"PA voters over 85"</span>
Executing saved query <span>'PA voters over 85'</span><span>:</span>
<span>select</span> count<span>(</span>*<span>)</span> from pa where date_of_birth <span>&lt;</span> <span>'1935-11-05'</span> and ballot_returned_date is not null<span>;</span>
+----------+
<span>|</span> COUNT<span>(</span>*<span>)</span> <span>|</span>
+----------+
<span>|</span> <span>126766</span>   <span>|</span>
+----------+</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course, they can <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/pa_mail_ballots_2020">view and query the data themselves on
DoltHub</a>
if they're too lazy to download it.</p>

<p>This morning I saw an additional claim about Pennsylvania's mail
ballots: <a href="https://twitter.com/VC4351/status/1325538470593400832">many of them were apparently registered as having been
returned on the same day they were mailed out to the voter, or earlier
in some cases</a>.</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Unlike the previous claim, this one actually seems to have some
merit. About 23,000 ballots in Pennsylvania are reported to have been
returned before they were mailed to the voter:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>pa_voters<span>&gt;</span> <span>select</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>from</span> pa <span>where</span> Ballot_Returned_date <span>&lt;</span> Ballot_mailed_date<span>;</span>

<span>+</span>
<span>|</span> <span>23305</span>    <span>|</span>
<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And a great many more were returned the same day or a day later, just
as the twitter thread claims. Here's a query that measures ballot
latency, counting how many ballots were returned by each day after
being mailed to the voter. That is: how many ballots were returned 1
day after being mailed, 2 …</p></div></div>

<p>It’s 9pm, you’re at your friend’s house, and the show you’re watching ends. You scramble to change the channel but you can’t figure out the remote. You stare at dozens of buttons with no clue where to start. <strong>Doesn’t it make you feel stupid?</strong> Some experimentation might get you somewhere, but it’s not easy. Why can’t you figure it out?</p>



<p>In these situations, we often blame ourselves. We’re not smart, patient, or capable enough. This conclusion is incorrect ⏤ <strong>product design is the direct cause of the stress</strong>.</p>



<p>This realization won’t help you with your frustrating remote experience. However, it does emphasize the importance of user experience design. <strong>We can redesign experiences to create new feelings</strong>.</p>



<p>Next time you’re confronted with a bad user experience, <a href="https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1324908038524899329">spend some time brainstorming better designs</a>. You never know where your experiments will take you.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about modern <a href="https://generalist.academy/2020/10/17/electoral-fairness/">democratic electoral systems</a>, and a couple of days ago I wrote about the complexities of the <a href="https://generalist.academy/2020/11/04/the-unpopular-president/">American Electoral College</a>. Today I wanted to go even further back, to the Medieval Venetian Republic. There, the selection of a new leader – the doge – was one of the more complex and baffling electoral processes in history. And even so, though this be madness, yet there is method in’t.</p>



<p>The Great Council of Venice was a large legislative body made up of a relatively small number of noble families. Obviously, everyone wanted to be the doge, but the council was very keen to avoid behind-the-scenes bribery, dirty deals, intrigue, and extended and contentious campaigns. To achieve this, the election of the doge went through multiple steps, all designed to reduce power consolidation.</p>



<p>First, thirty members of the Great Council were chosen at random. Then nine of those thirty were chosen, again randomly. Those nine members picked the next set: forty people from the Great Council. And those forty? Twelve, randomly picked from their number, moved on to the next step. Those twelve chose twenty-five; those twenty-five were randomly pared down to just nine. Having fun yet?</p>



<p>This set of nine members chose forty-five more; eleven were picked – again at random – from those forty-five. The eleven chose forty-one members. Those forty-one (finally!) voted for the doge. </p>



<p>There were some additional checks against skulduggery. Each noble family couldn’t have more than one member in each group, and members couldn’t vote for their own relatives. Every time a set of members voted for the next group, more than a simple majority was required: around three quarters of the voting group had to agree. (For the final election, just 25 of the 41 had to agree.)</p>



<p>To recap, this is the process:<br>Great Council &gt; 30 &gt; 9 &lt; 40 &gt; 12 &lt; 25 &gt; 9 &lt; 45 &gt; 11 &lt; 41 &gt; 1.</p>



<p>Because of this complexity, the chances of rigging or buying the election were greatly reduced, minority concerns were not buried by the majority, but neither was the majority tyrannized by the minority. Today we only use this kind of random process in jury selection and citizen’s assemblies.</p>

<p>Let’s say I’m ordering burritos for my two friends while they quar up in Jersey City, and want to calculate the total price of my order:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of spreadsheet; burrito price is listed as $7, burrito price w ship as burrito price plus $3, num burritos is 2, and total is num burritos times burrito price w ship, for a total of $20" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_0.png"></p>
<p>It’s a little confusing to follow the flow of data in a spreadsheet when it’s written like that, so I hope you don’t mind this equivalent diagram that represents it as a graph:</p>
<p><img alt="the previous spreadsheet represented as a graph, with arrows from one cell to another replacing the spreadsheet cell references" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_1.png"></p>
<p>We’re rounding the cost of an El Farolito super vegi burrito to $8, so assuming the per-burrito delivery toll remains at just $2 per burrito, it looks like the total for our two burritos will be $20.</p>
<p>Oh no, I completely forgot! One of my friends loves to wolf down multiple burritos at a time, so I actually want to place an order for three burritos. If I update <code>Num Burritos</code>, a naïve spreadsheet engine might recompute the entire document, recalculating first the cells with no inputs, and then recalculating any cell whose inputs are ready until we’ve finished every cell. In this case, we’d first calculate <code>Burrito Price</code> and <code>Num Burritos</code>, then <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, and then a new final <code>Total</code> of $30.</p>
<p><img alt="same as previous graph, but num burritos is updated to 3, and every cell is tagged as &quot;recalc&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_2.png"></p>
<p>This simple strategy of recalculating the whole document may sound wasteful, but it’s actually already <em>better</em> than VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet software ever made, and the first so-called “killer app”, responsible for popularizing the Apple II. VisiCalc would repeatedly recalculate cells from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, sweeping over them again and again until none of them changed. Despite this “interesting” algorithm, VisiCalc remained the dominant spreadsheet software for four years. Its reign ended in 1983, when Lotus 1-2-3 swept the market with “natural-order recalculation”, <a href="https://aresluna.org/attached/computerhistory/articles/spreadsheets/tenyearsofrowsandcolumns">as described by Tracy Robnett Licklider in Byte Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lotus 1-2-3 exploited natural-order recalculation, although it also supported VisiCalc’s row- and column-order modes. Natural-order recalculation maintained a cell dependency list and recalculated a cell before recalculating cells that depended on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lotus 1-2-3 implemented the “recalculate everything” strategy we’ve shown above, and for the first decade of spreadsheets, that was as good as it got. Yes, we recalculate every cell in the document, but at least we only recalculate every cell once.</p>
<h2>but what about “burrito price w ship”</h2>
<p>Great point, header 2. In my three burrito example there’s no reason to recompute <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, because changing the number of burritos we order can’t possibly influence the per-burrito price. In 1989, one of Lotus’ competitors realized this, and created SuperCalc5, presumably naming it after the theory of super burritos at the core of this algorithm. SuperCalc5 recalculated “only cells dependent on changed cells”, which would make updating the burrito count look more like this:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph, with burrito count updated from 2 to 3, but now only the two affected cells &quot;num burritos&quot; and &quot;total&quot; are tagged as recalc" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_3.png"></p>
<p>By only updating a cell when one of its inputs changes, we can avoid recalculating <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>. In this case, it saves just a single addition, but on larger spreadsheets it can save quite a bit of time! Unfortunately, we now have another problem. Let’s say my friends now want meat burritos, which cost a dollar more, and simultaneously El Farolito adds a $2 fee paid per-order, regardless of how many burritos you order. Before any formula outputs are recalculated, our graph might look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph (after burrito count update finished calculation), but now burrito price is being updated from $8 to $9, and simultaneously total is updated from &quot;burrito price w ship * num burritos&quot; to &quot;burrito price w ship * num burritos + $2 fee&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_4.png"></p>
<p>Since there are two updated cells here, we have a problem. Should we recalculate <code>Burrito Price</code> first, or <code>Total</code>? Ideally, we first calculate <code>Burrito Price</code>, notice that its output has changed, then recalculate <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code>, and finally recalculate <code>Total</code>. However, if we instead recalculate <code>Total</code> first, we’ll have to recalculate it a second time once the new $9 burrito price propagates down. If we don’t calculate cells in the right order, this algorithm isn’t better than recalculating the whole document. In some cases, it’s as slow as VisiCalc!</p>
<p>Clearly, it’s important for us to figure out the right order to update our cells. Broadly, there are two solutions to this problem: dirty marking and topological sorting.</p>
<p>This first solution involves marking all cells downstream from an edit as dirty. For instance, when we update <code>Burrito Price</code>, we would mark the downstream cells <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> and <code>Total</code> as dirty, even before doing any recalculations:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph with the two updates, but now three nodes are tagged as dirty: &quot;burrito price&quot;, &quot;burrito price w ship&quot;, and &quot;total&quot;. would also like to apologize for the rather confusing image alt text so far; it's really hard to write these for graph diagrams!! if you are a screen reader user and have advice on better ways to do this, would love to hear from you." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_5.png"></p>
<p>Then, in a loop, we find a dirty cell that has no dirty inputs, and recalculate it. When there are no dirty cells left, we’re done! This solves our ordering problem. There’s one downside though — if a cell is recalculated and we find its new output to be the same as its previous output, we’ll still recalculate downstream cells! A little bit of extra logic can avoid actually running the formula trouble in this case, but we unfortunately still waste time marking and unmarking a lot of cells as dirty.</p>
<p>The second solution is topological sorting. If a cell has no inputs, we mark its height as 0. If a cell has inputs, we mark its height as the maximum of the heights of its inputs, plus one. This guarantees all cells have a greater height than any of their inputs, so we just keep track of all cells with a changed input, always choosing the cell with the lowest height to recalculate first:</p>
<p><img alt="same as prior graph with the two updates, but instead of dirty tags, now every node has a height tag. &quot;burrito price&quot; and &quot;num burritos&quot;, the two cells with no in-nodes, have height 0. &quot;burrito price w ship&quot; has height 1. &quot;total&quot; has height 2." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_6.png"></p>
<p>In our double-update example, <code>Burrito Price</code> and <code>Total</code> would be initially added to the recalculation heap. <code>Burrito Price</code> has lesser height, and would be recalculated first. Since its output changes, we then would add <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> to the recalculation heap, and since it too has less height than <code>Total</code>, it would be recalculated before we finally recalculate <code>Total</code>.</p>
<p>This has a big advantage over the first solution: no cell is ever marked dirty unless one of its inputs actually change. However, it requires we keep all cells pending recalculation in sorted order. If we use a heap, this results in an <code>O(n log n)</code> slowdown, so in the worst case, asymptotically slower than Lotus 1-2-3’s strategy of recalculating everything.</p>
<p>Modern-day Excel uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/excel/excel-recalculation">a combination of dirty marking and topological sorting</a>, which you can read more about in their docs.</p>
<h2>demand-driven complications</h2>
<p>We’ve now more or less reached the algorithms used in modern-day spreadsheet recalculation. Unfortunately, I suspect there is basically no business case to be made for ever improving it further. The few people with the problem “my Excel spreadsheet is too slow” have already written enough Excel formulas that migration to any other platform is impossible. Fortunately, I have no understanding of business, and so we’re going to look at further improvements anyway.</p>
<p>Beyond caching, one of the cool aspects of a spreadsheet-style computation graph is we can only calculate the cells that we’re interested in. This is sometimes called lazy computation, or demand-driven computation. As a more concrete example, here’s a slightly expanded burrito spreadsheet graph. This example is the same as before, but we’ve added what is best described as “salsa calculations”. Each burrito contains 40 grams of salsa, and we perform a quick multiplication to know how much salsa is in our entire order. In this case, since our order has three burritos, there’s a total of 120 grams of salsa in our entire order.</p>
<p><img alt="a new graph. similar structure to the old graph, but there are two new nodes: &quot;salsa per burrito&quot;, which is set to the constant &quot;40 grams&quot;, and &quot;salsa in order&quot;, which is &quot;salsa per burrito&quot; times &quot;num burritos&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_7.png"></p>
<p>Of course, astute readers will have spotted the problem here already: knowing the total weight of salsa in an order is a pretty useless measurement. Who cares that it’s 120 grams? What am I supposed to do with this information?? Unfortunately, a regular spreadsheet would waste cycles calculating <code>Salsa In Order</code>, even if we don’t want it recalculated most of the time.</p>
<p>This is where demand-driven recalculation can help. If we could somehow specify that we’re only interested in the output of <code>Total</code>, we could only recompute that cell and its dependencies, and skip touching <code>Salsa In Order</code> and <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code>. Let’s call <code>Total</code> an <em>observed</em> cell, since we’re trying to look at its output. We can also call both <code>Total</code> and its three dependencies <em>necessary</em> cells, since they’re necessary to compute some observed cell. <code>Salsa In Order</code> and <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code> would be aptly described as <em>unnecessary</em>.</p>
<p>Some folks on the Rust team created the <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a> framework to solve this problem, clearly naming it after the unnecessary salsa calculations their computers were wasting cycles on. Salsa is really cool, and I’m sure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY">they can explain</a> how it works better than I can. Very roughly, they use revision numbers to track whether a cell needs recalculation. Any mutation to a formula or input increments the global revision number, and every cell tracks two revisions: <code>verified_at</code> to track the revision its output was last brought up-to-date, and <code>changed_at</code> to track the revision its output last actually changed.</p>
<p><img alt="our new graph, but now there's a title of &quot;current revision: R6&quot;. each cell is tagged with a change revision and verified at revision. all change revisions are R1, except &quot;salsa per burrito&quot;, which is R6. all verified at revisions are R6, except &quot;salsa in order&quot;, which is R1." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/anchors_8.png"></p>
<p>When the user indicates they’d like a fresh value for <code>Total</code>, we’d first recursively recalculate any cell necessary to <code>Total</code>, skipping cells if their <code>last_updated</code> revision is equal to the global revision. Once the dependencies of <code>Total</code> are up-to-date, we only rerun the actual formula in <code>Total</code> if either <code>Burrito Price w Ship</code> or <code>Num Burrito</code> have a <code>changed_at</code> revision greater than the <code>verified_at</code> revision of <code>Total</code>. This is great for Salsa’s purposes in the rust-analyzer, where simplicity is important and each cell takes a significant amount of time to compute. However, we can see the disadvantages in our burrito graph above — if <code>Salsa Per Burrito</code> constantly changes, our global revision number will frequently tick up. This will make each observation of <code>Total</code> walk the three cells necessary to it, even though none of those cells have actually changed. No formulas will be recalculated, but if the graph is large, repeatedly walking all of a cell’s dependencies could get expensive.</p>
<h2>faster demand-driven solutions</h2>
<p>Instead of inventing new algorithms for demand-driven spreadsheets, what if we instead draw from the two classical spreadsheet algorithms mentioned earlier: dirty marking and topological sorting? As you might imagine, a demand-driven model complicates both of these, but both are still viable.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at dirty marking. As before, when we change a cell’s formula, we mark all downstream cells as …</p></div></div>

<p>I don’t think the current state of “artificial intelligence” really has proven that it earns the great title of <em>intelligence</em>, as I believe it’s all still just a sophisticated application of statistics on large amounts of data. I prefer the title “machine learning”, as in my opinion that describes the process of adjusting the parameters of statistical methods based on the given data adequately.</p>
<p>I’m not even sure if intelligence and consciousness can be simulated by a computer. Because if they could, then the speed of execution surely wouldn’t matter to that fact, right? And if speed didn’t matter, one could just as well represent the (deterministic!) calculations of a finite computer on a piece of paper or by arranging some stones on a large field. Granted, it’d be somewhat slower than a modern computer and the paper would have to be sufficiently large, but in the end flipping bits, drawing on paper, and moving rocks in a systematic way is just the same when it comes to representing computation. So that’d mean if we arranged a bunch of stones on a large field in a certain pattern and then used some fancy (but deterministic) rules to move them around, we’d create consciousness?! I can’t really believe that’s true.</p>
<p><em>But how is a human brain any different??</em> In the end it’s also just biological wires exchanging electricity (+ some chemistry added to the process)…<br>
I can’t really grasp that. Do my thoughts make sense? Where’s the flaw?</p>

<p>ACF is a simple method to visualize music that produces surprisingly good results. Perhaps the most unexpected property of ACF is that it accurately transfers the subjective “harmony level” from music to images. It’s almost an unreasonable property, if you think about it.

<p>Contrary to what you might think, our ears don’t seem to rely on an FFT-like process to extract isolated frequencies. Instead, our ears detect periodic parts in the signal, although in most cases those periodic parts closely match the FFT frequencies. There is a simple <a href="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/pitch/missing-fundamental-stimuli">experiment</a> that proves this point:</p>

<p><img src="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/sites/default/files/missingFundamental2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As can be clearly seen on the FFT image, the A signal is a pure sinusoidal tone, while B is a mix of tones. Despite each tone in B is higher than A, our ears perceive B as a lower tone. If we plot both waveforms, we’ll see that A has about 9 peaks in a 20 ms window, while B has only 5. The definition of “peak” is moot, but it doesn’t stop our ears from counting them and using the “number of peaks per second” as a proxy to the tone height.</p>

<p>ACF detects those peaks. ACF sees that there are 5 equally spaced time shifts where <code>B[t] * B[t + shift]</code> reaches the maximum, so on the ACF output we’ll see those 5 peaks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that I’ve shamelessly stolen the experiment’s illustration above, I feel obligated to recommend the book where the illustration came from: <a href="https://auditoryneuroscience.com/book-preview">Auditory Neuroscience</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One downside of ACF is that it drops the phase component of the input signal, and thus ACF is not reversible. This means that images that only render ACF, lose about 50% of the information from the sound and those 50% are important, e.g. dropping the phase from recorded speech makes that speech indiscernible. Real world sounds, such as voice, heavily use nuanced amplitude and phase modulation. ACF captures the former, but ignores the latter.</p>



<p>ACF of a sound sample <code>X[0..N-1]</code> can be computed with two FFTs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>S = |FFT[X]|^2
ACF[X] = FFT[S]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And thus ACF contains exactly the same information as the spectral density <code>S</code> (the well known spectrogram).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re familiar with the ACF definition, you’ll notice that I should’ve used the inverse FFT in the last step. There is no mistake. The inverse FFT can be computed as <code>FFT[X*]*</code>, where <code>X*</code> is complex conjugate, but since <code>S[i]</code> is real-valued (and positive, in fact), the conjugate has no effect on it, and since ACF is also real valued in this case, the second conjugate has no effect either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ACF is a periodic and even function and so it can be naturally rendered in polar coordinates. In most cases, ACF has a very elaborate structure. Below are some examples, where red = ACF &gt; 0 and blue = ACF &lt; 0.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>conventional music</th>
      <th>a bird song</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td><img src="https://soundshader.github.io/pics/acf-c-3.jpg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Looking at the first example, we can tell that there are 5 prominent peaks in a 20 ms sound sample, which corresponds to 250 Hz. This means that our ears would necesserarily perceive this sound as a 250 Hz tone, regardless of what its spectrogram says. If it was a pure 250 Hz tone, we’d see perfectly round shapes of the <code>r = cos(250Hz * t)</code> line, but it’s not the case here: we see that the 5 peaks are modulated with small wavelets: there is one big wavelet in the middle (which consists of 3 smaller wavelets) and 4 smaller wavelets. Our ears would hear the big wavelet as the 2nd harmonic of the 250 Hz tone (i.e. it would be a 500 Hz tone with a smaller amplitude) and the 4 small wavelets as the 5th harmonic (1000 Hz) at barely discernible volume. In addition to that, the 500 Hz harmonic is also modulated by the 3 tiny wavelets, which means we’d hear a 1500 Hz tone, almost inaudible. We can say all this without even looking at the spectrogram or hearing the sound.</p>



<p>Music is a temporal ornament. There are many types of ornaments, e.g. the 17 types of wallpaper tesselations, but few of them look like music. However there is one particular type of ornament that resembles music a lot - I mean those “mandala” images. I don’t know how and why those are produced, but I noticed a connection between those images and music:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The 1st obvious observation is that a mandala is drawn in polar coordinates and is <code>2*PI</code> periodic. Sound is periodic too, so I thought the two facts are related.</li>
  <li>The 2nd observation is that patterns on those images evolve over the radial axis. Ans so is music is a sequence of evolving sound patterns.</li>
  <li>The 3rd observation is that a <code>2*PI</code> periodic function trivially corresponds to a set of frequencies. We usually use FFT to extract the frequencies and another FFT to restore the <code>2*PI</code> periodic function. Thus, a single radial slice of a mandala could encode a set of frequencies. If this is correct, a mandala is effectively an old school vinyl disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting these observations together we naturally arrive with the ACF idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-2ae295f5=""><p><em>Rust, not related to the video game also called Rust, is a promising systems programming language with novel features ideally suited for game development. Exposure and awareness within the game developer community, however, remains limited. In this post, I provide a gentle introduction to Rust and attempt to justify its place on your radar.</em></p>
<h2 id="a-short-history-lesson">A Short History Lesson</h2>
<p>What is Rust, and where did it come from? In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWkMFE8uRE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this fantastic talk</a>, James Munns gives us a detailed oral history. Way back around 2010, Mozilla was frustrated by the state of development in Firefox, a massive software project  written mostly in C++. Despite best practices and an abundance of engineering talent, writing high-performance, parallelised, and memory-safe code, at that scale of complexity, remained fraught and error-prone.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, this predates the advent of C++11 (aka the 2011 edition) which heralded efforts to somewhat modernise the language. Even so, manual memory manipulation is easy to get wrong, and <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">research</a> from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">multiple vendors</a> describes this category of error as responsible for 70% of security vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>Into this context steps Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee, introducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)#History" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a potential solution</a> to the roadblock: Rust, the hobby language he'd been tinkering with since 2006. In 2012, Mozilla would formally announce Servo, an experimental research project to re-imagine a browser engine built with memory safety and concurrency as first principles. And alongside it, Rust, the companion language to make it all possible.</p>
<p>These early days of Rust are described as a Cambrian explosion of ideas and wild experimentation. Concepts were liberally stolen from other languages, from C++ to OCaml, Haskell, Erlang, ML, C#, Ruby and more, reflecting the diverse pool of engineers working on the language at the time. Still, most in the industry, while admiring the optimism in taking such an ambitious moon shot, <a href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/09/18/falling-in-love-with-rust/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">remained pessimistic</a> about the prospects of success. </p>
<p>2015 saw a major milestone, with the release of Rust v1.0. Perhaps as significant as the feature list, was the number of failed experiments left behind on the cutting room floor, the team unafraid to pare down the language to its quintessential elements. This was also the first time stability guarantees would be offered, a quality notoriously absent before. </p>
<p>Soon after, in 2016, Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/shipping-rust-in-firefox/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shipped its first production Rust code</a>. The industry and community started to take notice, and Rust began its impressive, and as yet unbroken, <del>four</del> <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">five year streak</a> as Stack Overflow's most beloved language. [<em>Thank you James Munns for pointing out it's now actually five years</em>]. </p>
<p>Right from the outset, Rust set out with a clear focus on   building an inclusive community. They, in turn, have contributed to Rust's impressive technical aptitude, but have also fostered a sense of reverence and fondness not often witnessed in other languages. Are they crazy zealots or onto something?</p>
<h2 id="why-rust">Why Rust?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The performance of C++ with the convenience of C#</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first time Rust hijacked my attention. C++ enjoys a long-standing ubiquity, in part, due to its ability to express zero cost abstractions. As explained by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don't use, you don't pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's easy to spot the relevancy to games. Making frame-rate while simulating entire worlds is a daunting performance challenge. Indeed, C++ underpins the bulk of game engines. There simply is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltCgzYcpFUI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">no other industrial language</a> that offers the same speed and low-level control, whilst writing programs in the large. </p>
<p>C++, however, suffers from the weight of its legacy. The accumulation of features over 40 years makes for a complex and intricate language. In the last decade modernisation of the standard has done well to uplift it from its C roots, but the experienced programmer must build up an arcane lore of which features are blessed, and which machinery is dangerous. As Stroustrup again describes:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes the language daunting and difficult to approach for beginners. In <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>, Rust contributor <em>withoutboats</em> defines an import quality about abstraction:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A zero cost abstraction, like all abstractions, must actually offer a better experience than the alternative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, of course, C++ offers a better time than your own hand wrought assembly. However, this is making the subtle point that it's competing against a secondary force: a more expensive abstraction that justifies its cost by being more comfortable and convenient.</p>
<p>We see this writ large in the rise of popular game engines that eschew the complexity of C++, the most notable being Unity. End users write code in C#, a more forgiving and ergonomic language, creating a boon in developer productivity and a reduction in iteration time.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Unity-Interest.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>In large codebases though, near the edge of the performance envelope, this trade-off begins to bite. The garbage collector eliminates an entire category of errors by removing responsibility for memory management from the end-user. However as its workload grows, so do periodic performance spikes antithetical to smooth gameplay.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-11-GC-spikes.png" title="Unity interest over time in search trends"></p>
<p>The experienced developer can still create a performant experience, however, this demands plugging the leaks in the abstraction. They must build a mental model of the machinery behind the curtain, a collection of arcane wisdom that bans many of the original conveniences, lest they disturb the garbage collector. </p>
<p>So development teams face a choice. Better resourced AAA studios generally choose Unreal or in-house engine tech built on C++, able to absorb the overhead for long term gain. Less resourced studios optimise for time to market, choosing Unity, or one of the many other accessible game making tools (Godot, Haxe, Game Maker, etc.). They often postpone performance concerns until after business eligibility is secured.   </p>
<p>Rust, however, for the first time, promises a third way. A world where it's possible to write zero cost abstractions without sacrificing higher-order elegance. </p>
<h3 id="ownership-based-memory">Ownership based memory</h3>
<p>To understand Rust's special sauce, we're going have to talk about ownership and how it handles memory. This is only a simple sketch, but <a href="http://intorust.com/tutorial/ownership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in-depth resources</a> exist for the curious. </p>
<p>Writing optimised code is often about taking the way we, as humans, naturally think of an idea or algorithm, and instead expressing it in terms that favour the computer. This act often harms the legibility and understanding of a program, which makes it much harder for us, the humans, to reason about its correctness. </p>
<p>In a manually managed language, like C, the hapless programmer is left responsible for the machinations of the machine. They must take great care to ensure data is appropriately loaded into memory before operation, and then responsibly disposed of afterwards. A difficult dance in which missteps either cause dramatic crashes or else subtle and hard to detect vulnerabilities. But these are the very same tools that allow careful users to tune performance.  </p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, garbage collection promises the programmer it will automatically deal with the problem on their behalf. They are now free to express code naturally, but in doing so, it ties hands behind their back. They no longer have, at least not without indirection, the levers needed to wring out maximal performance.</p>
<p>Rust begins from a different premise. Rather than hiding this complexity, it accepts that computers are hard for humans, and instead tries to save us from the dangerous bits. Users can still tune the machine, but with less rope to wrap around their necks. </p>
<p>In the same way that static typing exists, very clever people have figured out how to make the compiler eliminate a whole category of memory and concurrency errors. To achieve this, Rust makes a bargain with the developer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm going to keep track of the lifetime of every piece of memory in your program for you. This way, I can detect the moment you're no longer using it and safely free it on your behalf. But in return, I'm going to need you to follow <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">strict rules</a> about the ownership of that memory. If you try to use it outside of the scope that owns it, my humourless friend here, the borrow checker, is going to make sure you don't hurt yourself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, like static typing, this lunch isn't free. Rust is known to have a steep learning curve, "fighting the borrow checker" becomes a right of passage. It takes time to learn this new paradigm. Ownership makes some familiar patterns difficult or impossible and demands new ones be learnt in their place. Perhaps we should revise our earlier statement as: "The performance of C++ with the <del>convenience</del> safety of C#"</p>
<h2 id="unpacking-rusts-popularity">Unpacking Rust's Popularity</h2>
<p>Early adopters have a selfish reason to extol the virtues of their chosen technology, as widespread adoption enhances the return on their risky investment. In this respect, while interest is high but opportunities for real-world exposure are limited, is it possible that Rust is cresting a wave of unearned hype? <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Not every javascript or python developer</a> interested in the language, for example, has a use case that merits the additional complexity.</p>
<p>To a developer standing on the shores of 2010, <code>git</code>, a new version control system with a steep learning curve, may have seemed like a risky investment. But, in the ensuing world of Github, it's hard to argue the effort was wasted, even if some workloads (i.e. large games) still require alternatives.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, how can we qualify Rust's popularity as a meaningful signal? Ultimately, we will only know by the volume of mud we've dug through in the trenches, and admittedly, it is far too early to collect this data for games. </p>
<p>In other industries, though, early reports of Rust are effusive. <a href="https://medium.com/the-innovation/how-microsoft-is-adopting-rust-e0f8816566ba" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mircosoft</a>, <a href="https://developers.libra.org/docs/community/coding-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-sponsorship-of-the-rust-project/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/rust/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a> all have Rust deployed in production.

These were essentially the earliest available discussions posted to the Internet by people working at various Universities who were already connected to the Internet. There were approximately 2.1 million posts in these archives created between Feb 1981 and June of 1991. This article describes the journey of converting those tapes into fully searchable PostgreSQL database and later also into the <a href="https://usenetarchives.com/groups.php?c=utzoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usenetarchives.com</a> website.</p><p>Until 2001, these early Usenet discussions were considered being lost, but miraculously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Spencer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Spencer</a> from the University of Toronto, Department of Zoology was backing it up onto magnetic tapes and kept them stored for all these years (apparently at a great cost).</p><p><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png" alt="" width="325" height="259" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15.png 1282w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-300x239.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-768x613.png 768w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-17_9-14-15-1024x817.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px"></a>H. Spencer had altogether 141 of these magnetic tapes, but there were of no use, so eventually, him and a couple of motivated people such as David Wiseman (who dragged 141 tapes back and forth in his a pickup truck), Lance Bailey, Bruce Jones, Bob Webber, Brewster Kahle, and Sue Thielen; embarked on a process of converting all of these tapes into the regular format, accessible to everyone.</p><p>And that’s the copy I downloaded. What a treasure, right?</p><p>Well, not so fast, once I unzipped the data, I realized that the TGZ format contains literally millions of small text files (each post in its own file). While it was certainly nice to have, it wasn’t something that I or anyone else could read. Certainly not in a forum like discussion format. It wasn’t obvious which post is the one that starts the discussion or which ones are the replies to the thread. And forget about searching through these files, that was utterly not possible. Just to put things into perspective, it took me over 5 hours to un-tar the archives.</p><p>That said, it didn’t take long for me to decide to develop a Python-based converter that would allow me to convert the entire collection from millions of flat files into a fully searchable PostgreSQL database. The following post talks about the process and also includes the Python code of the solution released as open source.</p><p>The UTZOO Usenet archive can be downloaded here:</p><ul><li>http://www.skrenta.com/rt/utzoo-usenet/</li><li>http://shiftleft.com/mirrors/utzoo-usenet/</li><li>https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTo7fRxpXwxv6Uw4TAAtyLWEmvugKaggrHSKNBTRHzWcA/</li><li>Or using this torrent: <a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive_archive.zip">utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive_archive</a></li></ul><p>Once downloaded you’ll see that archive contains 161 x TAR Archive files. It looks like this:</p><p><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png" alt="" width="596" height="531" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87.png 832w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87-300x268.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c69574363b87-768x685.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></a></p><p>So, I grabbed a copy of the 7-Zip archiver from <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">https://www.7-zip.org</a> and started decompressing the files.</p><p>I ended up with over <strong>2,104,828</strong>&nbsp;flat text files in <strong>56,988</strong> folders, which was the entire copy of Henry Spencer’s Usenet archive.</p><p>For those who like numbers, here is each Utzoo tape along with its size, number of files and folders:</p><p id="MLqhONH"><img loading="lazy" width="602" height="2294" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee.png 602w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-79x300.png 79w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-269x1024.png 269w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e6e422f3ee-403x1536.png 403w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p><h3>File Issues</h3><p>While examining the extract, I realized that Magnetic Tape 118 is uncompressed in \utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news118f1 folder, named tape118, so I had rename it to tape118.tar and extracted it manually, only to realize it’s a copy of files which I already have. Someone creating the original archive forgotten to remove that file. There are 3 files in these folders that need to have.tar extension added and decompressed as well:</p><ul><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news118f1\tape118</li><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news120f1\tape120</li><li>\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news121f1\tape121</li></ul><p>If you opened one of the folders and navigated down to one of the many subfolders, you’d find a file that contained the message. For example, going into&nbsp;\utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive\news006f1\b15\net\aviation folder, I was now apparently in the <strong>net.aviation</strong> Usenet group. But the only way to find out was to open one of the files and look at the content. Here I highlighted what it looked like.&nbsp;As you can see, each file seems to consist of a header, then a single empty line and the body of the message:</p><p id="RYYsysr"><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png" alt="" width="1110" height="759" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c.png 1110w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-300x205.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-768x525.png 768w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_5c6967453ae2c-1024x700.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px"></a></p><p>So, I decided to build a Python parser, that went through all these files reading the header portion of each message and grouping all unique results together, giving me all the possible headers such as (From, Subject, Newsgroup, etc.). I found that there were about 79 x different types of headers. So it appeared that not all messages adhered to the same basic structure. Going through the headers, all had the standard set that was common across all posts.</p><p>Once I had the common field, I’ve created a Postgres database called ‘utzoo’</p><pre>create database utzoo;</pre><p>And a new schema called all_messages</p><pre>create schema all_messages;


</pre><p>The above database and schema were the pre-requisites. Everything else, like table creation, inserting the posts, etc. is part of the Python script and fully automated.</p><p>In terms of table creation, the script automatically creates 5 tables for each detected newsgroup:</p><ul><li>headers – parsed headers</li><li>references – references for each message</li><li>body – text of the message</li><li>from – who posted the message</li><li>subjects – list of unique subject lines</li></ul><p>This is what the script auto-creates for each unique Group name:</p><pre>create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_headers</strong>
(
    id         bigserial not null
        constraint GroupName_headers_pk primary key,
    dateparsed timestamp,
    subj_id    bigint,
    ref        smallint,
    msg_id     text,
    msg_from   bigint,
    enc        text,
    contype    text,
    processed  timestamp default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_headers
    owner to postgres;


create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_refs</strong>
(
    id      bigint,
    ref_msg text default null
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_refs
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_body</strong>
(
    id   bigint primary key,
    data text default null
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_body
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_from</strong>
(
    id   serial not null
        constraint GroupName_from_pk primary key,
    data text
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_from
    owner to postgres;

create table all_messages.<strong>GroupName_subjects</strong>
(
    id      serial not null
        constraint GroupName_subjects_pk primary key,
    subject text
);
alter table all_messages.GroupName_subjects
    owner to postgres;</pre><p>Those will be the tables where the Python parser will dump all the data and make sure posts are properly lined up between tables.</p><p>The python script also creates indexes to make the inserting and later reading of the posts faster:</p><pre>create unique index GroupName_headers_uiidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(id);
create unique index GroupName_headers_umidx on all_messages.GroupName_headers(msg_id);
create unique index GroupName_body_idx on all_messages.GroupName_body(id);; 
create unique index GroupName_from_idx on all_messages.GroupName_from(data);
create unique index GroupName_subjects_idx on all_messages.GroupName_subjects(subject);

</pre><p>Once created, the structure per group looks like this:</p><p id="kdsmyQE"><img loading="lazy" width="362" height="703" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4.png 362w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3e7d98df4-154x300.png 154w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px"></p><p>The following screenshot explains how it’s all wired up. I didn’t do any hardcoded relationships, but you can change the script if you want that.</p><p id="THgecCD"><img loading="lazy" width="601" height="496" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef.png 601w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e40111a6ef-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"></p><p>The date is an integral part of each message and I had to do some data conversion massaging in Python to get the proper date, as dates were coming in a variety of formats. I’ve tried various libraries but dateutil.parser.parse standard date and time library for Python did the best job.</p><p>However, I still needed to account for various labelling of data fields in the headers, so if data wasn’t found in the ‘date’ header, I had to look into other header parts such as ‘NNTP-Posting-Date’, ‘X-Article-Creation-Date’,&nbsp;‘Posted’,&nbsp;or ‘Received’ fields.</p><p>Well and then it was all about creating a Python parser, start the PostgreSQL, point it to an archive directory, and wait :)</p><p>At the bottom of this article is the code of the Python solution. It’s about 1,000 lines, and it took altogether about 1 day to create and test it. The script is smart enough to keep the track of where it started, so if it needs to be interrupted, it’ll know where to continue from to get the job done.</p><p>The source code is available on GitHub as open-source under MIT license:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/python_mbox_parser/blob/master/utzoo2postgres.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/python_mbox_parser/blob/master/utzoo2postgres.py</a></p><p>The final solution artifact is called ‘<strong>utzoo2postgres.py</strong>‘ , and it was tested on Python 3.8.</p><p>Open the script and define the path to un-tared Utzoo archive directories.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre># for Windows
positionFilePath = "E:\\Usenet\\Utzoo\\"
# for linux:
# positionFilePath = "/Usenet/Utzoo/"</pre><p>Also, define the particulars of your PostgreSQL database:</p><pre>db_connection = psycopg2.connect(host="localhost", user="", password="", port="5432", database="utzoo")</pre><p>And then just execute the script!</p><pre>python 3 utzoo2postgres.py</pre><p><em>Note: In case you need to stop the program and run it later, the script is smart to resume from the last spot it was processing.</em></p><p>The script will process all Utzoo Archive messages in about 6 hours (depending on the speed of your machine).</p><p>Screenshot from processing:</p><p id="UwdOjId"><img loading="lazy" width="713" height="585" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7dc52b05827.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7dc52b05827.png 713w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7dc52b05827-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"></p><p>Here is a screenshot of the database after only a couple of minutes of conversion:</p><p id="JQYnVLo"><img loading="lazy" width="432" height="642" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3dc6ce1c7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3dc6ce1c7.png 432w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e3dc6ce1c7-202x300.png 202w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></p><p>As you can see, the conversion utility produces a database with 5 tables per group where messages are linked to each other through auto-created indexes.</p><p id="kdsmyQE">Let’s say we want to look up all discussions in the<strong> net.physics</strong> discussions; and sort them out by the number of replies.</p><p>This is how you can do that:</p><p id="ymEaJie"><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b.png" alt="" width="1198" height="625" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b.png 1198w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b-300x157.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b-1024x534.png 1024w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e48cfddb5b-768x401.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px"></a></p><p>Now, we can look up a particular discussion by the ID. For example, we want the ID: 1648 from the screenshot above, the discussion with the subject: “<strong>Question on FTL and quantum mechanics</strong>“. That’s not so hard either:</p><p id="rcwUUqq"><a href="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d.png" alt="" width="1697" height="847" srcset="https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d.png 1697w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d-300x150.png 300w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d-768x383.png 768w, https://www.joe0.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/img_5f7e49dfdfd6d-1536x767.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1697px) 100vw, 1697px"></a></p><p>It’s nice to have a database full of posts, but it’s hardly usable that way.

                <div>
                    <p>Kubernetes is a tremendously powerful cluster management system. &nbsp;There are many pluggable technologies to choose from that exhibit the features you desire, which is great because you have options--but also comes with the down-side that the likelihood someone else has done exactly what you are trying to do is slim. &nbsp;Eventually, there will be some consolidation as developers gather around the best solutions, but for the moment, there are lots of interesting projects to choose from (and not a ton of great examples for certain configs). Today, I'm sharing a slightly challenging setup and hoping it helps the community.</p><p>I am using Istio as my L7 ingress and routing controller, which is based on Envoy. &nbsp;It is a highly scalable L7 proxy with excellent performance characteristics and relatively mature feature set. When it came time to implement a basic <code>/admin</code> route on a project, I came up with the list of features that I wanted to achieve. &nbsp;My desired config:</p><ul><li>Applications should not have access to user passwords or necessarily email</li><li>Applications should not re-implement role-based access control (RBAC) security, as every application will need it</li><li>Users should be able to login without creating yet another username/password to remember, but support it if they prefer</li><li>Users should be able to self-register, password reset if necessary, and manage what remote authentications are associated with their account without needing support (Google keyword CIAM)</li><li>Application Admins should be able to edit the role of users, either explicitly or by group permissions, with a visual interface for non-technical people to control access</li><li>K8s Ops should be able to change what RBAC rules protect individual routes to applications without a redeploy</li><li>Fully self-hosted, to limit external dependencies and have auditable security around user data</li></ul><p>The simplest way to get started is to follow the excellent walkthrough on <a href="https://www.blog.jetstack.io/blog/istio-oidc/">Jetstack.io</a> that explains in reasonably good detail how to cover your whole ingress with JWT handling. &nbsp;I won't go over all that detail here. &nbsp;Instead, I will present the exact YAML manifests necessary to directly deploy a working config, as well as show screenshots of relevant bits in FusionAuth of exactly how to configure the application so it communicates properly with these manifests.</p><h3 id="why-fusionauth">Why FusionAuth?</h3><p>I usually try out two or three alternative technologies before settling into one I like. Although I did start with KeyCloak, it felt a little unpolished and left a lot to be desired when it came to explaining how to configure it if the terminology wasn't familiar (eg. people who aren't security professionals). &nbsp;I studied several other options and it came down to Gluu or FusionAuth. &nbsp;The main deciding factor for me in favor of FusionAuth was the amount of documentation and tutorials (with much appreciated touches of humor). &nbsp;There is also a clear effort made by the developers to provide official docker images and Kubernetes examples that show real world use. &nbsp;I have been remarkably satisfied with this decision.</p><h3 id="quick-architecture-overview">Quick Architecture Overview</h3><p>Ok, so let's talk about the architecture of how this works together. &nbsp;Like any other traffic using Istio, a request will come into an application by following the routing rules of a <code>VirtualService</code> to a <code>Service</code>, then to a Deployment's <code>Pod</code>. &nbsp;To use the Istio security features, this pod needs to have the Sidecar Proxy running, otherwise the rules don't do anything. (This is unfortunate, as it has been my experience that the sidecar can cause connectivity issues with certain workloads, so just be aware it can cause side effects and you may need to explicitly create and configure the <code>Sidecar</code> for this namespace). The easiest way to get this working is to enable automatic sidecar proxy injection on a new <code>Namespace</code> and deploy the application there. &nbsp;By declaring a <code>RequestAuthentication</code> rule, we configure Istio to refuse any traffic that doesn't have a validly signed Json Web Token (JWT). &nbsp;And by declaring an <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> rule, we configure Istio to accept or deny traffic by matching specific HTTP paths or user roles, etc. &nbsp;That's great! &nbsp;Right?</p><p>Well, Istio isn't quite mature enough to speak Open ID Connect. &nbsp;It's only smart enough to expect a validly decoded JWT and do some simple pattern matching against its contents. &nbsp;When those rules fail, you just get <code>RBAC: access denied</code> as a response to your request. &nbsp;There's no redirection logic to send the browser to the auth server login page. &nbsp;So, let's teach it to do that with a simple <code>EnvoyFilter</code> rule that is injected on <code>SIDECAR_INBOUND</code>. This lets us target specific applications to protect only the routes we care about without impacting anything else. </p><p>A few critical details: <code>RequestAuthentication</code> only accepts a &nbsp;JWT that is signed with an RSA key, because HMAC is a symmetrical key and anyone who can decode it can also sign it. &nbsp;This means it needs to know where to get the public RSA key, which is supplied in the <code>issuer</code> field. &nbsp;Assuming this checks out, Istio then looks at any <code>AuthorizationPolicy</code> rules and either <code>ALLOW</code> or <code>DENY</code> traffic based on matching or non-matching details. &nbsp;In this case, I have provided a basic rule that allows anyone who has been verified to have an account with this application, and further restrict the <code>/admin/</code> path to accounts that have the <code>admin</code> role. &nbsp;Should anything go wrong, Istio just says <code>RBAC: access denied</code> . &nbsp;To diagnose, just delete these rules and try hitting the endpoint to see what errors pop up. &nbsp;If these rules are removed and you are still getting Unauthorized messages, it's oauth2-proxy refusing the user--check the config and logging to see why.</p><p>Here's the YAML we've all been waiting for. &nbsp;This fully describes a working config where the <code>VirtualService</code> is in the default namespace but everything else is in <code>auth</code> just to keep it away from everything else. &nbsp;The application is hosted at <code>https://auth-example.reachablegames.com</code>. &nbsp;Certain difficult and undocumented details that cause problems if not configured properly have been commented below--please pay attention before changing or simplifying things.</p><pre><code># create namespace where applications can have sidecar injection

To get posts like this straight to your inbox, </em><a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><em>subscribe here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>—</p><p>Youtube recommended to me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVnDE8wSrVo">what Elon Musk would work on if he was 22 years old today</a>. The video has almost 3 million views. In the past, I would’ve immediately watched the whole video, gotten inspired by what Elon thought were industries important to the future of humanity and then spent a ton of time working on that and telling everyone about it. All because Elon Musk thought it was important.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is outsourcing your thinking</strong>. This trick served me well in highschool and throughout college, but it’s not sustainable for long term success and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two problems with outsourcing your thinking. Continuing with the example of past me, there are things I’m already interested in, have&nbsp;<a href="https://nav.al/specific-knowledge">specific knowledge</a>&nbsp;about or possess a competitive advantage in, that won’t be mentioned on Elon’s list. Consequently, the first problem is that I will look down on those things as less meaningful and important and not pursue them, despite my better suitability and chances of success in those areas.</p><p>The second problem with outsourcing your thinking is that once the novelty of the problem fades away, I’d be faced with navigating difficulty, naysayers and the friction of creating something new, without an internal compass to guide me toward the correct paths to take. Put simply, Elon Musk isn’t there to talk me through what he thinks the path forward to be. This all stems from the issue that I pursued something, not because I had interest in that thing, actually enjoyed it or thought it was important, but because Elon Musk (or whoever else) thought it was important to work on. And I followed his thinking, rather than thinking for myself.</p><p>The reason this is important is because most success in business is having&nbsp;<strong>product-market-founder fit</strong>, not just about working on what’s world changing or hot. It’s about building a product that solves a burning problem for the right market and&nbsp;<strong>being the right person, with the right intuition</strong>&nbsp;to bring that product to market, operate that company and delight those customers. Even if you’re working on an important problem, if you don’t have conviction that comes from your own mental models, you’ll get burned when chaos hits. Just ask all the crypto ‘experts’ of 2016/17.&nbsp;<strong>It’s better to build something that’s an expression of yourself, rather than something others think is smart.</strong></p><p>Outsourcing your thinking is a manifestation of the error of trusting others more than we trust ourselves.&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation">Josh Waitzkin</a>&nbsp;talks about how this phenomenon of outsourcing your thinking happens all the time in the investing world:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>If you take investors, there might be an investment, which one from the outside we think is objectively good. But it really isn't objectively good. It has to fit into one's portfolio of investments in a way that emerges from one's own mental models. Otherwise, it is not a form of self expression. Then, when you enter volatility, you're not gonna know what to do with it.</em>” -&nbsp;<a href="https://avthar.com/blog/jw-curation">Josh Waitzkin</a></p></blockquote><p>Elon Musk is a placeholder for anyone telling you what you should do or think. That could be entrepreneurs or VCs you idolize or maybe your parents (especially true if you’re brown). The reality is that you should not care what Elon Musk or anyone else says is important, you should decide for yourself what you should work on, based on following your own curiosity and interest.&nbsp;<strong>Do the hard work of experimenting, exploring and thinking for yourself. Don’t outsource your thinking.</strong></p><p><a href="https://avthar.substack.com/"><em>Subscribe here</em></a><em> to get posts like this straight to your inbox, </em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Here’s the complete timeline of events. From my first denial to travel to the US until I eventually received a tourist visa. And then I can’t go anyway.</p>



<h2>December 5-11, 2016</h2>



<p>I spent a week on Hawaii with Mozilla – my employer at the time. This was my 12th visit to the US over a period of 19 years. I went there on ESTA, the visa waiver program Swedish citizens can use. I’ve used it many times, there was nothing special this time. The typical procedure with ESTA is that we apply online: fill in a form, pay a 14 USD fee and get a confirmation within a few days that we’re good to go.</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hawaii-2016.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hawaii-2016.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="414"></a><figcaption>I took this photo at the hotel we stayed at during the Mozilla all-hands on Hawaii 2016.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>June 26, 2017</h2>



<p>In the early morning one day by the check-in counter at Arlanda airport in Sweden, I was refused to board my flight. Completely unexpected and out of the blue! I thought I was going to San Francisco via London with British Airways, but instead I had to turn around and go back home – slightly shocked. According to the lady behind the counter there was “something wrong with my ESTA”. I used the same ESTA and passport as I used just fine back in December 2016. They’re made to last two years and it had not expired.</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/bagder/status/879198063998513152"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot_2020-11-06-Twitter-Publish.png" alt="" width="553" height="199"></a><figcaption>Tweeted by me, minutes after being stopped at Arlanda.</figcaption></figure>



<p>People engaged by Mozilla to help us out could not figure out or get answers about what the problem was (questions and investigations were attempted both in the US and in Sweden), so we put our hopes on that it was a human mistake somewhere and decided to just try again next time.</p>



<h2>April 3, 2018</h2>



<p>I missed the following meeting (in December 2017) for other reasons but in the summer of 2018 another Mozilla all-hands meeting was coming up (in Texas, USA this time) so I went ahead and applied for a new ESTA in good time before the event – as I was a bit afraid there was going to be problems. I was right and I got denied ESTA very quickly. “Travel Not Authorized”.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/ESTA-travel-not-authorized.png" alt="" width="642" height="458"><figcaption>Rejected from the ESTA program.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Day 0 – April 17, 2018</h2>



<p><strong>Gaaah</strong>. It meant it was no mistake last year, they actually mean this. I switched approach and instead applied for a tourist visa. I paid 160 USD, filled in a ridiculous amount of information about me and my past travels over the last 15 years and I visited the US embassy for an in-person interview and fingerprinting.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/Administrative-Processing.png" alt="" width="577" height="289"></figure>



<p>This is day 0 in the <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/07/28/administrative-purgatory/" data-type="post" data-id="11076">visa process</a>, 296 days after I was first stopped at Arlanda.</p>



<h2>Day 90 – July 2018</h2>



<p>I missed the all-hands meeting in San Francisco when I didn’t get the visa in time.</p>



<h2>Day 240 – December 2018</h2>



<p>I <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/18/im-leaving-mozilla/">quit Mozilla</a>, so I then had no more reasons to go to their company all-hands…</p>



<h2>Day 365 – April 2019</h2>



<p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/04/17/one-year-in-still-no-visa/" data-type="post" data-id="12216">A year passed</a>. “someone is working on it” the embassy email person claimed when I asked about progress.</p>



<h2>Day 651- January 28, 2020</h2>



<p>I emailed the embassy to query about the process</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png" alt="" width="611" height="166"><figcaption>Screenshotted email</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reply came back quickly:</p>



<blockquote><p>Dear Sir, </p><p>All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the administrative processing is concluded.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Day 730 – April 2020</h2>



<p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/04/17/two-years-in/" data-type="post" data-id="13456">Another year had passed</a> and I had given up all hope. Now it turned into a betting game and science project. How long can they actually drag out this process without saying either yes or no?</p>



<h2>Day 871 – September 3, 2020</h2>



<p>A friend of mine, a US citizen, contacted his Congressman – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Connolly">Gerry Connolly</a> – about my situation and asked for help. His office then subsequently sent a question to the US embassy in Stockholm asking about my case. While the response that arrived on September 17 was rather negative…</p>



<pre>your case is currently undergoing necessary administrative processing and regrettably it is not possible to predict when this processing will be completed.</pre>



<p>… I think the following turn of events indicates it had an effect. It unclogged something.</p>



<h2>Day 889 – September 22, 2020</h2>



<p>After 889 days since my interview on the embassy (only five days after the answer to the congressman), the embassy contacted me over email. <em> For the first time since that April day in 2018.</em></p>



<pre>Your visa application is still in administrative processing. However, we regret to inform you that because you have missed your travel plans, we will require updated travel plans from you.</pre>



<p>My travel plans – that had been out of date for the last 800 days or so – suddenly needed to be updated! As I was already so long into this process and since I feared that giving up now would force me back to square one if I would stop now and re-attempt this again at a later time, I decided to arrange myself some updated travel plans. After all, I work for an American company and I have a friend or two there.</p>



<h2>Day 900 – October 2, 2020</h2>



<p>I replied to the call for travel plan details with an official invitation letter attached, inviting me to go visit my colleagues at <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/">wolfSSL</a> signed by our CEO, Larry. I really want to do this at some point, as I’ve never met most of them so it wasn’t a made up reason. I could possibly even get some other friends to invite me to get the process going but I figured this invite should be enough to keep the ball rolling.</p>



<h2>Day 910 – October 13, 2020</h2>



<p>I got another email. Now at 910 days since the interview. The embassy asked for my passport “for further processing”.</p>



<h2>Day 913 – October 16, 2020</h2>



<p>I posted my passport to the US embassy in Stockholm. I also ordered and paid for “return postage” as instructed so that they would ship it back to me in a safe way.</p>



<h2>Day 934 – November 6, 2020</h2>



<p>At 10:30 in the morning my phone lit up and showed me a text telling me that there’s an incoming parcel being delivered to me, shipped from “the Embassy of the United State” (bonus points for the typo).</p>



<figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/embassy-text.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/embassy-text.png" alt="" width="496" height="211"></a></figure>



<h2>Day 937 – November 9, 2020</h2>



<p>I received my passport. Inside, there’s a US visa that is valid for ten years, until November 2030.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VISA.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VISA.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="221"></a><figcaption>The upper left corner of the visa page in my passport…</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a bonus, the visa also comes with a NIE (National Interest<br>Exception) that allows me a single entry to the US during the PP (Presidential Proclamations) – which is restricting travels to the US from the European Schengen zone. In other words: I am actually allowed to travel right away!</p>



<p>The timing is fascinating. The last time I was in the US, Trump hadn’t taken office yet and I get the approved visa in my hands just days after Biden has been announced as the next president of the US.</p>



<h2>Will I travel?</h2>



<p>Covid-19 is still over us and there’s no end in sight of the pandemic. I will of course not travel to the US or any other country until it can be deemed safe and sensible.</p>



<p>When the pandemic is under control and traveling becomes viable, I am sure there will be opportunities. Hopefully the situation will improve before the visa expires.</p>



<h2>Thanks to</h2>



<p>All my family and friends, in the US and elsewhere who have supported me and cheered me up through this entire process. Thanks for keeping inviting me to fun things in the US even though I’ve not been able to participate. Thanks for pushing for events to get organized outside of the US! I’m sorry I’ve missed social gatherings, a friend’s marriage and several conference speaking opportunities. Thanks for all the moral support throughout this long journey of madness.</p>



<p>A special thanks go to David (you know who you are) for contacting Gerry Connolly’s office. I honestly think this was the key event that finally made things move in this process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No More Free Work from Marak: Pay Me or Fork This</p>

  <p>Respectfully, I am no longer going to support Fortune 500s
( and other smaller sized companies ) with my free work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gist is that Marak, who’s on the brink of homelessness after his apartment building caught fire, is no longer interested in doing unpaid work for businesses using his <a href="https://github.com/Marak/faker.js">faker.js</a> project. He seems to be getting a lot of support from the open source developer community.</p>

<h2 id="unpaid-interns">Unpaid Interns</h2>

<p>The foundational principle of open source is “fix your problem, then give the world a copy of the solution.” So let’s get one thing straight: <em>open source developers are not volunteering to fix your problem.</em> They are fixing their own problems, then letting you use the solution too because it costs them nothing. That near-zero cost of replicating software is why open source works.</p>

<p>Because of this, I don’t think developers claiming to do open source should expect compensation for features that they need for themselves. But developing a new feature that they don’t need is something different entirely. In IT we call that a Change Request, and CRs come with a fee to cover them. ‘Near-zero cost’ doesn’t apply anymore because now they’re taking on a lot of work they otherwise wouldn’t have done.</p>

<p>Not recognizing this difference has led to a situation where for-profit entities are using open-source devs as unpaid interns. Well it’s worse really: at least interns get resume filler.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-free-features">No More Free Features</h2>

<p>I look forward to a day when asking anyone to do unpaid labor is considered unethical by our industry. That goes for feature requests on open source projects, on unpaid internships, and on unpaid ‘take home’ interview assignments.</p>

<p>Requesting work in an economic context without offering compensation in some form is morally indefensible. It’s wrong because unpaid labor is wrong. It’s wrong because presuming on anyone’s helpful nature is wrong. We shouldn’t be using bounties to move our change requests to the head of the line because we shouldn’t even be making requests without a bounty attached.</p>

<h2>Ortografia cyrylicka dla języka polskiego</h2>
<h2>A Cyrillic orthography for the Polish language</h2>

<p><big>E</big>ver wondered what Polish would look like if it were written in Cyrillic? Perhaps you have. Or not. In any case, I have. That's what happens when you spend half of your life working on language projects that one way or another are related to Polish or the Slavic languages in general. Toying around with Polish, Slavic, as well as with several Slavic orthographies, it is hard not to think about the possibilities of a Cyrillic orthography for Polish.</p>

<p>Many people have argued that Cyrillic would be unsuitable for Polish. I disagree with that opinion. Granted, Polish phonology differs from that of the other Slavic languages in several ways, but these two facts remain: Polish is a completely Slavic language by any standard, and Cyrillic, unlike the Latin alphabet, was made especially to fit Cyrillic phonology, and therefore is perfectly suited for it. Therefore, I am convinced that Polish and Cyrillic are a perfect match. Much more so, in fact, than Polish and the Latin alphabet. Latin orthographies of Slavic languages always have one of the following two disadvantages: either they are full of diacritical marks, or they look horribly like English or another Western language. Slovene manages best, but still has <b>š</b>, <b>ž</b> and <b>č</b>. Other languages have more of those babies. Polish orthography has managed to avoid hačeks, but has a whole bunch of other diacritics instead: <b>ą</b>, <b>ę</b>, <b>ł</b>, <b>ż</b>, <b>ć</b>, <b>ń</b>, <b>ó</b>, <b>ś</b>, <b>ź</b>. Besides, Polish in addition tends to favour digraphs like <b>sz</b> and <b>ie</b>, so Polish words tend to be appear longer than they actually are.</p>

<p>Now, I am quite fond of Polish orthography, and therefore my Cyrillic orthography of Polish should by no means be treated as a serious proposal to replace Polish orthography. If anyone would ever make such a proposal, I would be the first to stand up against it. This project, therefore, is primarily a thought experiment, my answer to the question if such an orthography would be possible at all.</p>

<p>The idea, by the way, is not new at all. If we have to believe Wikipedia, Russia's czar Nikolay I intended to cyrillify Polish in the mid-19th century as a means for russification, although at last nothing came of his plans. Here is a sample:</p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>

Тамъ пр̌едъ цудовнымъ клęкнийце образэмъ,<br>
Побожне змóвце пацёрэкъ.</p><p>
Тато не враца ранки и вечоры<br>

</td><td>
<div><p>Слышąцъ то дзятки бегнą вшистке разэмъ<br>

Бąдзь похвалёна пр̌енайсьвęтша Трóйца<br>
Тэразъ и часу вшелькего.</p><p>
(...)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>A few pecularities in this text deserve our attention:
</p><ul>
<li>the use of the letter <b>р̌</b> for Polish <b>rz</b>;
</li><li>the hard sign <b>ъ</b> at the end of many words (a feature common in prerevolutionary Russian);
</li><li>the fact that Polish <b>ó</b> remains untouched;
</li><li>this orthography inherits the Polish ogonek and adds it to Cyrillic letters;
</li><li>the use of <b>ць</b> and <b>дзь</b> where Polish has <b>ć</b> and <b>dź</b>, a feature also present in contemporary Belarusian.
</li></ul>

<p>My own Cyrillic orthography for Polish is largely based on the same premises, but there are a few differences as well, which I will describe below. By the way, it should be noted that the transcription quoted above is not the only attempt at a Cyrillic alphabet for Polish. Several people have played with the idea, seriously or less seriously. An interesting example is <a href="http://varpho.livejournal.com/2006/11/17/">Jusowica (Юсовица)</a>, created by Szymon Pawlas.</p>

<hr>

<p><big>T</big>he biggest problem related with the Cyrillisation of Polish are sounds that do not exist in other languages, nor do they correspond closely with anything else that exist in them: the nasal vowels <b>ą</b> and <b>ę</b>. The 19th century Russian solution is in fact a pretty funny one: it simply teleports the ogonek to Cyrillic, thus producing four characters that have never seen before in Cyrillic: <b>а̨</b>, <b>э̨</b>, <b>я̨</b> and <b>е̨</b> (the latter two representing <b>ją</b> and <b>ję</b> respectively). A funny solution indeed! And an unnecessary one to that, because Old Church Slavonic has precisely four Cyrillic characters for exactly these four sounds: <b>ѫ</b>, <b>ѧ</b>, <b>ѭ</b> and <b>ѩ</b>. True, they are uncommon, because the only living Slavic language that preserved these sounds is Polish, a language that happens to be written in Latin alphabet. But since these letters are around, why shouldn't we simply use them? After all, they exist, and are indefinitely more Cyrillic than Cyrillic letters with ogoneks beneath them. Besides, the choice for <b>а̨</b> and <b>я̨</b> is equally unlogical as the Polish letter <b>ą</b> itself, since it is pronounced as nasalised <b>o</b>; it is not for nothing that the Latin transcription of Old Church Slavonic uses <b>ǫ</b>.</p>

<p>Another specifically Polish letter is the <b>ó</b>, pronounced as [u] (its Czech equivalent is <b>ů</b>). The transcription mentioned above conveniently keeps it. But why would we? It has no pronunciation of its own; the only thing that distinguishes it from <b>u</b> is that it alternates with <b>o</b>. Incidentally, mixing up those two is the most common spelling mistake in Polish. As far as I am concerned, there is no reason to keep it. Since <i>miasto</i> alternates with <i>mieście</i> (and not with <i>miæście</i> or something), why can't <i>grud</i> alternate with <i>grodzie</i>? So let's be bold and use <b>у</b> instead.</p>

<p>The characters <b>ć</b> and <b>dź</b> could of course be rendered like Belarusian (and in a way, Polish) does, by using <b>ць</b> and <b>дзь</b>, but I'd much prefer <b>ть</b> and <b>дь</b>. Etymologically speaking, this is more correct; after all <b>ć/dź</b> are the softened equivalents of <b>t/d</b>, not of <b>c/dz</b>. Sequences like <b>ti</b> and <b>di</b> are rare in Polish and occur only in foreign words. In these rare cases, we could write <i>радио</i> and <i>тиара</i> (a Pole will know that they are to be read as <i>radio</i> and <i>tiara</i> and not like <i>radzio</i> or <i>ciara</i>). Or, if we want to be really sure that the <b>t</b> will not be softened in these cases, we could use the hard sign and write <i>радъио</i> and <i>тъиара</i>.<br>
Using <b>ть</b>/<b>дь</b> instead of <b>ць</b>/<b>дзь</b> has one more advantage: now at least will not have to worry about the sequence <b>cja</b>, which is unambiguously rendered as <b>ця</b>.</p>

<p>Same goes for the digraphy <b>rz</b>, which in Polish is pronounced like <b>ż</b>. Another common source of spelling errors. Yet, I wouldn't propose transcribing it to <b>ж</b>, for the same etymological reasons: <b>rz</b> comes from softened <b>r</b>, while <b>ż</b> comes from softened <b>g</b>. The fact that it sounds very different does not change that fact. Therefore, we simply use <b>рь</b> (and not this weird creation from the 19th century, <b>р̌</b>). Just like <b>ti</b> and <b>di</b>, <b>ri</b> is a rare sequence in Polish that occurs only in foreign words, so I propose the same solution for it as well.</p>

<p>And then we have the letter <b>e</b>. Because in Polish palatalising <b>e</b> is way more numerous than its non-palatalising equivalent, we will use Cyrillic <b>e</b> for the former (usually rendered as <b>je</b> or <b>ie</b>) and <b>э</b> for the latter. This is also what the 19th century version does.</p>

<p>The choice for other Cyrillic letters is merely a matter of picking an option. For example, how do we represent <b>i</b> and <b>y</b>? Do we follow the Russian model and pick <b>и/ы</b> or do we prefer the Ukrainian model and pick <b>і/и</b>? Both are possible, but I've decided to follow the Russian model. Also, when preceded by <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> or <b>ż</b> we write <b>и</b> instead of <b>ы</b> – just like Russian does. Again, a matter of etymology.</p>

<p>So, let's see now what Cyrylica Polska looks like.</p>

<a name="alphabet"><hr></a><h2>Alphabet</h2>

<p><big>C</big>yrylica Polska has 37 letters. Exactly the same as the 33 letters of the Russian alphabet, with four additional characters for the nasals:</p>

<p><p><b><span size="+1">А Б В Г Д Е Ë Ж З И Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я Ѧ Ѫ Ѩ Ѭ</span></b></p></p>

<a name="vowels"><hr></a><h2>Vowels</h2>

<p><big>E</big>very vowel has a hardening and a softening version. Both can occur in two possitions: either it follows a consonant, or it doesn't (in that case it is either word-initial or after another vowel). In Polish orthography, when a softening vowel follows a consonant, it is preceded by <b>i</b>, unless the consonant in question is inherently soft. In other positions this vowel is preceded by <b>j</b>. The only exceptions are <b>i</b>, which is softening by definition, and <b>y</b>, which is never softening. <br>
Just like <b>i</b> and <b>y</b> form a pair, in Cyrillic all vowels come in pairs, as you can see in the table below:</p>

<p><table><colgroup><col><col><col><col>
</colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Latin</th><th colspan="2">Cyrylica</th></tr>
<tr><th> <i>hard</i> </th><th> <i>soft</i> </th><th> <i>hard</i> </th><th> <i>soft</i> </th></tr>
<tr><td>	a	</td><td>	ia/ja		</td><td>	а	</td><td>	я	</td></tr>
<tr><td>	e	</td><td>	ie/je		</td><td>	э	</td><td>	е	</td></tr>

<tr><td>	ę	</td><td>	ię/ję		</td><td>	ѧ	</td><td>	ѩ	</td></tr>
</tbody></table></p>

<a name="consonants"><hr></a><h2>Consonants</h2>

<p><big>N</big>ow that the question of palatalised vs. non-palalalised consonant has been resolved by the vowels that follow them, the consonants have suddenly become very simple to handle. Here goes:</p>

<p><table><tbody><tr><td>
<table><colgroup><col width="40%"><col width="60%">

</td></tr></tbody></table></p>

<p>A few notes:
</p><ul>
<li>Most consonants can be soft (palatalised) or hard. Whether a Cyrillic <b>д</b> should be read as <b>d</b> or <b>dź</b> is decided by the consonant that follows it: <b>дэ</b> should be read as <b>de</b>, <b>де</b> should be read as <b>dzie</b>.
</li><li>If a soft consonant is not followed by a vowel, i.e. when it is word- or syllable-final, it is followed by the soft sign: <b>bat</b> becomes <b>бат</b>, <b>bać</b> becomes <b>бать</b>.
</li><li>In reality, the soft sign will occur only after <b>т</b>, <b>д</b>, <b>н</b>, <b>л</b>, and <b>р</b>. However, in a few cases it can be placed after another consonant as well, although that wouldn't affect pronunciation. For example, take these two Polish cities: Kraków and Wrocław. When declined, the former has a hard <b>w</b>, the latter a soft <b>w</b>, and so their genitives are <i>Krakowa</i> and <i>Wrocławia</i> respectively. In Cyrillic, we could easily write <b>Вроцлавь</b> for "Wrocław", to make this fact predictable.
</li><li>Most consonant clusers as palatalised as a whole, and only in a few cases consonants in such a cluster are palatalised individually. Therefore, <b>śmiałość</b> is written <b>смялость</b>, and not <b>сьмялосьть</b>.
</li><li>The consonant clusters <b>śr</b> and <b>źr</b> (historically from <i>ser-/zer- &gt; srze-/zrze-</i>, in some dialects <i>st…</i></li></ul></div>

                <p>The COVID-19 crisis, while disrupting the global world unlike anything before, has opened up an unexpected window to remote work. Nearly all major<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>tech<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> giants<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> have<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> allowed their workers to do home office. Many people are considering this as a sign of the advent of <strong>Work 2.0</strong>, where physical offices spaces will be irrelevant, and people can work from their cozy dens. There are however significant challenges in adoption of generalized remote work and things will be back as usual once the COVID-19 ends.</p>
<p>The <strong>challenges surrounding remote work outweigh it’s promises</strong>. Not every company is a FAANG, and companies will struggle to transition given their limited resources.</p>
<h2 id="regulations">Regulations</h2>
<p>The most significant hurdle in hiring a global remote team is <strong>regulation</strong>. Labor regulations are wildly different amongst countries, and could be cumbersome for some companies. Some major hurdles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Payroll taxes</strong>, retirement bonuses: Germany has rentenversicherung, sozialversicherung whereas USA has 401k contributions. Can a German company afford to <strong>setup payroll</strong> taxes for a remote workers hired from India, Chile or US? Or will it lead to worker abuse through <strong>laissez-faire abuse</strong> through freelance contracts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notice periods</strong>: Europeans (on average) have 3 months notice period while US Americans have 2 weeks. How would a US company deal with it? On top of that, several countries have <strong>protection against unlawful termination</strong>, and how can a Slovakian employee avail that benefit against a German company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP protection</strong>: It’s hard to <strong>protect IP</strong> if employees are not in the same jurisdiction. A company operation from Czechia would find it hard to settle trade disputes with a remote worker from South Africa. Another example is of <strong>TISAX compliance</strong> that is required for specialized hardware projects for Automotive industries. Remote work fails to make a dent in this situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-cant-remote">Hardware can’t remote</h2>
<p>Patio11’s law<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> states that the <strong>economy is much bigger than you think</strong>. There are companies which have widely different business models and they often have a hardware related product. My <a href="https://www.salonlab-server.de/en-GB/">current project</a> is an IoT device that talks to an iPad app. The <strong>hardware team</strong> needs <strong>specialized tools</strong> to work on the IoT device, and these tools can’t be moved to home office. Remote work is a strict no-no for such products.</p>
<h2 id="swim-against-the-tide">Swim against the tide</h2>
<p>The biggest hurdle employees face in remote/home offices is <strong>lack of focus and direction</strong>. Humans have evolved over thousands of years to collaborate based on interpersonal cues, and a video call simply does not have the same effect. Humans need <strong>feedback</strong> and <strong>constructive communication</strong> whereas isolation kills the spirit. People who are new to remote work often feel <strong>rudderless</strong> because <strong>self discipline is hard</strong> when there’s no structure. I’m doing remote work on-and-off since 2018, and it took me a lot of discipline to get productive. The simple fact is that remote work is not natural, and not suited for all work streams in a typical company. Add to it the fact that many <strong>families</strong> simply don’t have space to work from home, and on top of that there might be kids around.</p>
<p>Remote work might be one of the few positive outcomes of the COVID-19 crisis but unless we tend to it carefully, we’ll end up creating a unhappy and unproductive workspace.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div><p>In this guide we're going to take a look at how we can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing OpenBSD router with firewalling capabilities, segmented local area networks, DNS with domain blocking, DHCP and more.</p><p>We will use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into three separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. We will also look at how we can use DNS to block out ads, porn, and other websites on the Internet. The OpenBSD router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p></div>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office, you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>Very rarely do consumer-grade modems or routers get firmware updates and they are often vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router#Security">network attacks</a> that turns these devices into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnets</a>, such like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">Mirai malware</a>. Many consumer-grade modems and routers is to blame for some of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_denial_of_service_attack">distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks</a>.</p>
<p>A firewall between you and your ISP modem or router cannot protect your modem or router device against attacks, but it can protect your computers and devices on the inside of the network, and it can help you monitor and control the traffic that comes and goes to and from your local network.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and the Internet, and with OpenBSD you get an very solid solution.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>Currently this guide only deals with IPv4 as most people still don't use IPv6 and many ISPs also still only use IPv4, but IPv6 is planned for a future update of the guide.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple solutions with the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving. Unfortunately the ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer made, but I'm just using it as an example, I have used several other cheap boards as well.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>Most of the current ASRock J-series can be used. Search for any J-series board on Amazon and a list will show up on recent hardware. Such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-Motherboard-Mini-DDR3-Q1900B-ITX/">ASRock Q1900B-ITX</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-J5005-ITX-Quad-Core-Processor-Motherboards/">ASRock J5005-ITX</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-Motherboard-CPU-Combo-J3355M/">ASRock J3335M</a> (These are not affiliate links!). Many other low power brands from other motherboard producers can be uses as well.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performs very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply.</p>
<p>Last, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a>, such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>You might also need a couple of cheap gigabit switches for the segmented local network, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="why-openbsd">Why OpenBSD?</h2>
<p>In truth, you can get a similar setup with one of the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems">BSD flavors</a> or one of the many different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">Linux distribution</a>, but <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> is specifically very well suited and designed for this kind of task. Not only does it come with all the needed software in the base install, but it also has significantly better security and tons of improved mitigations already build-in into the operating system. I <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/openbsd-is-fantastic.html">highly recommend</a> OpenBSD over any other operating system for this kind of task.</p>
<p>This guide is not going to show you how to install OpenBSD. If you haven't done that before I recommend you spin up some kind of virtual machine or see if you have some unused and supported hardware laying around you can play with. OpenBSD is one of the easiest and quickest operating systems to install. Don't be afraid of the non-gui approach, once you have tried it you will really appreciate the simplicity. Use the default settings when in doubt.</p>
<p>Before you endeavor on this journey make sure to reference the OpenBSD documentation! Not only is everything very well documented, but you will most likely find all the answers you need right there. Read the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html">OpenBSD FAQ</a> and take a look at the different <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/">manual pages</a> for the software we're going to use.</p>
<p>Another really useful place to find general information about OpenBSD is the <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc">OpenBSD mailing list archives</a>. Also make sure to stay up to date with relevant information by subscribing to the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">Announcements and security advisories</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, please consider <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/donations.html">supporting OpenBSD</a>! Even if you don't use OpenBSD on a daily basis, but perhaps make use of <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> on Linux, then you're really using software from the OpenBSD project. Consider making a small, but steady donation to support the further development of all the great software the OpenBSD developers make!</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet, and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>A router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems, while a router joins similar networks. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 networks of the same type to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented local area networks (LANs). Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial we're going to use the quad port NIC from the illustration above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't have to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the settings from this guide, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS blocking (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children requires only very limited access, but it is doable with some work, and the guide is going to show you one way you can do that.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>
<pre><code>
                       Internet
                          |
                    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
                    ISP Modem (WAN)
                      10.24.0.23
                          |
                       OpenBSD
                      10.24.0.50
                  (router/firewall)
  …</code></pre></article></div>

November 9, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Saturday, November 7, 2020</p>
<p>After fixing the performance and scalability problems, we’re on our way to getting a stable Pijul. In this post, I explain what I’ve been up to in the recent months.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Pijul has always been advertised as a research project, trying to implement a theory of patches that would be sound and fast. This is an ambitious goal, and became even more ambitious than initially envisioned.</p>
<p>One of the hardest challenges is that source code is by essence stateful, which makes it much harder to iterate over algorithm designs, like normal research projecst need to. For example, in order to get from our last published version to our current design, we have gone through many different variants, and there wasn’t much to publish.</p>
<p>Moreover, the UX aspect is what matters most in the end, and testing it on a real world project is the only way to get it there. However, unlike in a compiler, where bootstrapping is done one step at a time, and previous versions are always available to compile your current one, a version control system has the additional problem that the previous versions might not always be easily accessible if there is a bug.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms I’ve heard since I realised that better datastructures were possible is that I was “working secretely”. I certainly understand this feeling, but this is based on a misunderstanding of how research works. When I first had the idea that I’m explaining in this post, I realised that a complete rewrite would be needed. But for a very long time, almost nothing other than unusable, unreadable prototypes happened.</p>
<p>Back then, there wasn’t much to show, since it wasn’t even clear that the basic datastructure would work. And even when they started working at a large enough scale, it took me quite a bit of testing on large repositories before they started actually working.</p>
<p>This also implies that there wasn’t much to show for quite a while, since the new algorithm wasn’t usable until very recently, and any repository started before now would have become obsolete in a matter of days.</p>
<p>There were also <a href="#a-personal-note">persoprofessional reasons</a> for this silence, described at the end of this post.</p>

<p>Pijul depends on two other projects I’ve started.</p>
<h3 id="sanakirja">Sanakirja</h3>
<p>One of these projects is Sanakirja, which is “just” a key-value store, but has the extra feature that databases can be cloned efficiently. I would have loved to just use an existing library, but there just isn’t any that has this cloning feature. However, the scope of Sanakirja is still quite modest, it does one thing and does it well. Obviously, it took some time to find the memory-management bugs, but I have good confidence that this is now done.</p>
<p>In previous releases of Pijul, databases were implemented with a single mmapped file containing the binary representation of B Trees. Despite their lower writing performance (compared to alternatives such as <em>Log-structured merge-trees</em>), and the complexity of the code for deletions, B Trees are very well suited to this use case: indeed, since they are trees, reference-counting the nodes is enough to implement efficient clones.</p>
<p>One of the remaining issues was that in order to grow the database, we needed to un-mmapped the file, grow it, and mmap it again. Since applying a single change in Pijul must be an atomic operation, we needed to cancel the transaction when that happened, and restart it with a bigger file.</p>
<p>Another issue is that I wanted the next libpijul to compile on platforms that don’t have mmap, such as WASM. However, if reallocating an mmapped file has a very low complexity (even though it does have a non-zero cost in terms of system calls), reallocating a chunk of memory often requires copying everything. This completely defeats the point of the algorithms in Pijul, which rely on a particular representation of the datastructures on the disk.</p>
<p>The main innovation in Sanakirja 0.13 is to use a vector of memory blocks (either in memory or mmapped from a file), of exponentially-increasing size. The overhead is just one extra indirection, the complexity of adding items is the same (since the operation of creating an extra block is $O(1)$). The exponentially-increasing sizes mean that the allocated memory is always at least half-full.</p>
<h3 id="thrussh">Thrussh</h3>
<p>The other one is Thrussh. That library implements the SSH protocol, and tries to handle a number of key formats. The former is a surprisingly easy goal, and keeping up with Tokio versions has historically been the hardest bit, while the latter is the most horrendous hydra-like task, with new heads and legacy formats showing up every time you think you’re done.</p>
<h2 id="how-repositories-used-to-work-and-still-do-to-some-extent">How repositories used to work (and still do, to some extent)</h2>
<p>Old-style repositories represented a single file by a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ of lines, where each vertex $v\in V$ represented a line, and an edge from $u \in V$ to $v\in V$, labelled by some change (also called patch) number $c$, could be read as “according to change $c$, line $u$ comes before $v$”.</p>
<p>This means that changes could introduce vertices and lines, as in the following example, where a line $D$ is introduced between $A$ and $B$:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-add.svg">
</p>
<p>Here, the thick line represents the change from the file containing the lines $A$, $B$, $C$ to the file with the new line $D$.
An important feature to note is that <strong>vertices are uniquely identified</strong>, by the hash of the change that introduced them, along with a position in that change. This means that two lines with the same content, introduced by different changes, will be different. It also means that a lines keeps its identity, even if the change is applied in a totally different context.</p>
<p>Moreover, this system is append-only, in the sense that <em>deletions</em> are handled by a more sophisticated labelling of the edges. In the example above, if we want to delete line $D$, we just need to make a change mapping the edge introduced by $c_0$ to a deleted edge, which we label by the name $c_1$ of the change that introduces it:</p>
<p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/repos-line-del.svg">
</p>
<p>From now on, we call the full edges <strong>alive</strong>, and the dashed ones <strong>dead</strong>.</p>
<p>We have just described the two basic kinds of actions in Pijul. There are no other. One kind adds vertices to the graph, along with “alive” edges around them, and the other kind maps an existing edge label onto a different one.
In order to fully described the system, I also need to mention that the edge labels are given by two parameters: their status (alive, deleted, and a few others related to multiple files and technical details explained below) and the change that introduced them.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<p>This scheme allows to defines dependencies between changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ adds a vertex, we must have its <em>“context”</em>, i.e. the lines before and after it, hence the changes that introduced these lines are in the dependencies of $c$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a change $c$ deletes a vertex, or in other words maps an existing edge introduced by a change $d$, then $c$ must depend on $d$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is just the minimal set of dependencies needed to make sense of the text edits. Hooks and scripts may add extra language-dependent dependencies based on semantics.</p>
<h3 id="are-edge-labels-minimal">Are edge labels minimal?</h3>
<p>Our goals is to find the smallest possible system, both for reasons of mathematical aesthetics (why store useless stuff?) and the other one for performance. Therefore, one immediate question comes to mind: why even keep the change number on the edges?</p>
<p>In order to answer that question, suppose we don’t keep the labels, meaning that the maps happen between statuses only. Then, consider the following two situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Change inverses</strong></p>
<p>The first issue happens when two authors delete a line in parallel, and one of the authors reverts their change. Applying these changes yields the following diagram, where the two deletions get merged into one, and the inverse applies to both:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse2.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, this is not what we expect, since one of the authors explicitly reverted the deletion, while the other performed the same deletion in parallel.
By keeping the labels, this is what we get instead:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/inverse3.svg">
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing contexts</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, in the rest of this post, we name two users Alice (with pronouns “she/her”) and Bob (with pronouns “he/his”).</p>
<p>This situation, where Alice writes something in the middle of a paragraph $p$, while Bob deletes $p$ in parallel.
One issue here, is that the situation is not symmetric: when Bob applies Alice’s change, he can tell immediately that something is wrong, because the context of Alice’s edits is labelled as deleted in his repository.</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices1.svg">
 </p>
<p>However, Alice’s situation is different: indeed, consider the case where instead of deleting $p$ <em>in parallel</em> of her changes, Bob deleted $p$ after applying Alice’s change. The edges deleted are exactly the same, but this is not a conflict, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices2.svg">
 </p>
<p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that this system doesn’t behave symmetrically with the contexts above and below the new line. Indeed, if Bob deleted the <em>down context</em> of the line (i.e. if he deleted line $C$) instead of the <em>up context</em> (line $B$), Alice could detect the conflict, since in that case, $C$ would have both an alive and a dead edge pointing to it ($C$ is called a “zombie vertex” internally), as shown in the following diagram:</p>
 <p><img src="https://pijul.org/img/known-vertices0.svg">
 </p>
<p>Keeping the change identifiers on each edge allows us to solve this. In Pijul 0.12, Bob would add the labels of all the edges around the deleted lines to the dependencies of his change. Then, Alice can tell whether Bob knows of her change before applying it. The changes are conflict if and only if Bob doesn’t know of the new lines.</p>
<p>However, this behaviour was counter-intuitive, <a href="https://discourse.pijul.org/t/why-these-patches-dont-commute/449">as noted by @tae</a>.</p>
<p>A finer analysis of what dependencies are led to a different behaviour in the new Pijul. Changes now have two different sets of …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I believe Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> feature does not get the recognition
it deserves. I think part of the reason for this is that its
documentation is somewhere deep down in the (already obscure)
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html">contextlib</a> module because formally ExitStack is just one of many
available context managers for Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement">with statement</a>. But
ExitStack deserves far more prominent notice than that. This post will
hopefully help with that.</p>
<p>So what makes ExitStack so important? In short, it's the best way to
handle allocation and release of external resources in Python.</p>
<div id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The main challenge with external resources is that you have to release
them when you don't need them anymore -- and in particular you must
not forget to do so in all the alternate execution paths that may be
entered in case of error conditions.</p>
<p>Most languages implement error conditions as "exceptions" that can be
"caught" and handled (Python, Java, C++), or as special return values
that you need to check to determine if an error occured (C, Rust,
Go). Typically, code that needs to acquire and release external
resources then looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
<span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
    <span>finally</span><span>:</span>
        <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>)</span>
<span>finally</span><span>:</span>
   <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>or, if the language doesn't have exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>();</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>goto</span> <span>error_out1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1</span>
<span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>();</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>goto</span> <span>error_out2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
<span>retval</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// ok</span>

<span>error_out2</span><span>:</span>
  <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>);</span>
<span>error_out1</span><span>:</span>
  <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>);</span>
<span>return</span> <span>retval</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This approach has three big problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cleanup code is far away from the allocation code.</li>
<li>When the number of resources increases, indentation levels (or jump
labels) accumulate, making things hard to read.</li>
<li>Managing a dynamic number of resources this way is impossible.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Python, some of these issues can be alleviated by using the
<tt>with</tt> statement:</p>
<div><pre><span></span> <span>@contextlib.contextmanager</span>
 <span>def</span> <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>id_</span><span>):</span>
     <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource</span><span>(</span><span>id_</span><span>)</span>
     <span>try</span><span>:</span>
         <span>yield</span> <span>res</span>
     <span>finally</span><span>:</span>
         <span>release_source</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>)</span>

<span>with</span> <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>RES_ONE</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>res1</span><span>,</span> \
   <span>my_resource</span><span>(</span><span>RES_TWO</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>res2</span><span>:</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However, this solution is far from optimal: you need to implement
resource-specific context managers (note that in the above example we
silently assumed that both resources can be acquired by the same
function), you can get rid of extra indentation only if you allocate
all the resources at the same time and live with an ugly continuation
line (no parenthesis allowed in this context), and you still need to
know the number of required resources ahead of time.</p>
<p>Over in the world of exception-less programming languages (no pun
intended), <a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go</a> has developed a different remedy: the <a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statement">defer statement</a>
defers execution of an expression until the enclosing
function returns. Using <tt>defer</tt>, the above example can be written
as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res1</span><span>)</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1</span>
<span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
<span>if</span><span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>==</span> <span>NULL</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>defer</span> <span>release_resource</span><span>(</span><span>res2</span><span>)</span>
<span>// do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
<span>return</span> <span>0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is pretty nice: allocation and cleanup are kept close together,
no extra indentation or jump labels are required, and converting this
to a loop that dynamically acquires multiple resources would be
straightforward. But there are still some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>To control when exactly a group of resources is getting released you
have to factor out into separate functions all parts of code that
access the respective resources.</li>
<li>You cannot "cancel" a deferred expression, so there is no way to
e.g. return a resource to the caller if no error occured.</li>
<li>There is no way to handle errors from the cleanup functions.</li>
<li><tt>defer</tt> is available in Go, but not in Python.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exitstack-to-the-rescue">
<h2>ExitStack to the rescue</h2>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack">ExitStack</a> fixes all of the above issues, and adds some benefits on
top of it. An ExitStack is (as the name suggests) a stack of clean-up
functions. Adding a callback to the stack is the equivalent of calling
Go's <tt>defer</tt> statement. However, clean-up functions are not executed
when the function returns, but when execution leaves the <tt>with</tt>
block - and until then, the stack can also be emptied again.</p>
<p>Finally, clean-up functions itself may raise exceptions without
affecting execution of other clean-up functions. Even if multiple
clean-ups raise exceptions, you are will get a usable stacktrace.</p>
<p>Here's how to acquire multiple resources:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>with</span> <span>ExitStack</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>cm</span><span>:</span>
    <span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_one</span><span>()</span>
    <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>release_resource</span><span>,</span> <span>res1</span><span>)</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1</span>
    <span>res2</span> <span>=</span> <span>acquire_resource_two</span><span>()</span>
    <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>release_resource</span><span>,</span> <span>res2</span><span>)</span>
    <span># do stuff with res1 and res2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>acquisition and release are close to each other</li>
<li>there's no extra indentation,</li>
<li>the pattern and it easily scales up to many resources (including a
dynamic number that's acquired in a loop)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there already is a context manager for your resource, there's also
a shortcut function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>with</span> <span>ExitStack</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>cm</span><span>:</span>
    <span>res1</span> <span>=</span> <span>cm</span><span>.</span><span>enter</span><span>(</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'first_file'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>))</span>

<p>What if it were possible to write software capable of time travel? What if we could write software that was able to retrieve results from a computation solved sometime in the near future? What would this software look like? What problems could be solved?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#Time_loop_logic">Time loop logic</a> is a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">Novikov self-consistency principle</a>. In this system the computer is able to send the result of a computation backwards through time and rely upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct. This futuristic concept might seem impossible now but I'd imagine trying to explain nuclear fission to a 3rd century blacksmith would seem equally impossible.</p>
<h2 id="writing-time-loop-software">Writing time loop software</h2>
<p>Building on the concept of time loop logic we are able to implement theoretical programming constructs to help better understand the concept of time travel in software. In the following examples we demonstrate what a time loop logic program might look like.</p>
<h3 id="an-event-loop">An event loop</h3>
<p>In the follow examples we'll be using the JavaScript programing language. JavaScript provides a single thread of execution for code to run in. The JavaScript virtual machine is constantly running an event loop. Each tick of this event loop represents a single cycle of code execution. Once this cycle is completed the next tick in the event loop will occur. In the popular <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> framework <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback">an API is provided</a> to defer the execution of a block of code until the nextTick of the event loop occurs.</p>
<h4 id="node-js-process-nexttick-example">node.js process.nextTick() example</h4>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

process.nextTick(foo);
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
</code></pre><p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code><span>bar
</span><span>foo</span>
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.nextTick</code> can also be achieved using JavaScript's setTimeout command</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>0</span>)</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="node-js-process-prevtick-example">node.js process.prevTick() example</h4>
<p>Now let's imagine that instead of deferring a line of code until the next tick of the event loop we could instead push that code <em>backwards</em> to the <em>previous</em> tick of the event loop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>foo</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>'foo'</span>);
}

<span>console</span>.log(<span>'bar'</span>);
process.prevTick(foo);
</code></pre><p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code><span>foo</span>
bar
</code></pre><p>The same effect of <code>process.prevTick</code> can also be achieved using setTimeout with a negative value</p>
<pre><code>setTimeout<span>(<span>foo</span>, <span>-1</span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>Since all we are doing is logging a simple string to the console, this is a contrived example. However; building on the concept of <code>process.prevTick</code> we can begin to implement more complex time loop programs.</p>
<h2 id="brute-force-cracking-with-time-loops">Brute force cracking with time loops</h2>
<p>Let's assume a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute-force search</a> password cracking scenario. Imagine there is a login function which expects a password. We have access to a very large word dictionary in which our cracking software will sequentially attempt logins using every word in the dictionary as a password until a match is found.</p>
<p>Here is the code for our brute-force program</p>
<p><em>Note: It's important to remember that Novikov's self-consistency principle guarantees that the sequence of events generating the paradox in the following code has zero probability.</em></p>


<h2 id="prime-factors-with-time-loops">Prime Factors with time loops</h2>
<p>Using time-loop logic  prime factors can be calculated in polynomial time.</p>


<h2 id="zero-lag-instant-communication">Zero-lag / Instant Communication</h2>
<p>The theoretical application of time-loop logic is endless. Imagine a time-loop based communication protocol. This would mean zero millisecond latency. Imagine gaming, video broadcasting, and file sharing with instantaneous transfer and zero lag. Through exploiting self-consistency we know that data will be sent in the immediate future ( since the data has begun transferring from the source ) and that eventually the transmission will arrive at it's destination. As long as the data will eventually be received, we are able to send the result back from the future into the immediate present, removing the notion of latency or lag.</p>
<h2 id="time-loop-logic-and-novikov-s-self-consistency-principle">Time Loop Logic and Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle</h2>
<p>How is it actually possible to program a time loop? Based on the self-consistency principle and continuing advancements in quantum entanglement these types of mind-bending constructs are not very far away. It's very possible we'll see this type of software actively being developed within the next hundred years.</p>
<p>Time loop logic was first written about by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec">Hans Moravec</a> who is best known for his work in robotics and artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find Hans' original paper from 1991, "Time Travel and Computing", here: <a href="https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html">https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html</a>. I recommend reading the entire paper.</p>
<p>What we know from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve#General_relativity">general relativity</a> is that at a quantum level backwards time-travel is mathematically possible in certain solutions containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve">closed timelike curves</a>. A closed timelike curve is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">world-line</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentzian_manifold#Lorentzian_manifold">Lorentzian manifold</a>. </p>
<p>Closed timelike curves ( CTCs ) pose a problem for physicists. The existence of CTCs introduces the notion of time travel being possible. If time travel is possible, we have now introduced the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">time travel paradoxes</a> which can violate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>. Since it's generally accepted that we cannot violate causality in our universe we must be able to explain how closed time-like curves can exist.</p>
<p>In his self-consistency principle Novikov asserts that if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, or to any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. In short, it says that it is impossible to create time travel paradoxes. You can find the original paper here: <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737">http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3737</a>. I recommend starting with reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#History_of_the_principle">history of the principle</a>.</p>

<p>In order for time loop logic to return an answer instantaneously, we <em>must</em> ensure that the problem will run long enough into the future to <em>actually</em> calculate the result. If a problem takes sixty seconds to solve, the program must run for at least sixty seconds. Time-loop logic does <em>not</em> violate causality. We are able to retrieve the answer instantly because we have committed to spending sixty seconds in the future calculating the answer and sending it back.</p>
<p>This turns debugging time-loop logic into somewhat of an impossibility. Any bugs in a time loop indicate that sometime in the future a problem has occurred. <strong>This event may or may not be related to software.</strong> </p>
<p>Imagine a computer that utilized a time loop to brute force crack passwords ( as our code posted above did). I turn the machine on and request it cracks the password. The program doesn't work. Frustrated, I turn off the machine and complain to my co-worker Josh.</p>
<p>Josh turns on the machine and requests the password. The software works instantly cracking the password in under 1ms.</p>
<p>Bewildered, I ask Josh why the machine worked for him but not for me.</p>
<p>Josh replies, "It's actually quite simple. Using that computer it's going to take approximately 400 hours to brute force the password. After that 400 hours the CPU must recursively return the cracked password back in time until it reaches right now. I was able to get the answer instantly because I have decided to not turn this computer off for another 399 hours and 59 minutes. Simply put, you turned off the computer too quickly"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>TL;DR: <strong>“Structured concurrency” refers to a way to structure async computations so that child operations are guaranteed to complete before their parents, just the way a function is guaranteed to complete before its caller.</strong> This sounds simple and boring, but in C++ it’s anything but. Structured concurrency — most notably, C++20 coroutines — has profound implications for the correctness and the simplicity of async architecture. It brings the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-160">Modern C++ style</a> to our async programs by making async lifetimes correspond to ordinary C++ lexical scopes, eliminating the need for reference counting to manage object lifetime.</p>
<h2>Structured Programming and C++</h2>
<p>Back in the 1950’s, the nascent computing industry discovered structured programming: that high-level programming languages with lexical scopes, control structures, and subroutines resulted in programs that were far easier to read, write, and maintain than programming at the assembly level with test-and-jump instructions and <code>goto</code>. The advance was such a quantum leap that nobody talks about structured programming anymore; it’s just “programming”.</p>
<p>C++, more so than any other language, leverages structured programming to the hilt. The semantics of object lifetime mirror — and are tied to — the strict nesting of scopes; i.e., the <em>structure</em> of your code. Function activations nest, scopes nest, and object lifetimes nest. Objects’ lifetimes end with a scope’s closing curly brace, and objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction to preserve the strict nesting.</p>
<p>The Modern C++ programming style is built on this structured foundation. Objects have <em>value semantics</em> — they behave like the ints — and resources are cleaned up in destructors deterministically, which guarantees structurally that resources aren’t used after their lifetimes have ended. This is <em>very</em> important.</p>
<p>When we abandon this strict nesting of scopes and lifetimes — say, when we reference count an object on the heap, or when we use the singleton pattern — we are fighting against the strengths of the language rather than working with them.</p>
<h2>The Trouble With Threads</h2>
<p>Writing correct programs in the presence of concurrency is far more difficult than in single-threaded code. There are lots of reasons for this. One reason is that threads, like singletons and dynamically allocated objects, scoff at your puny nested scopes. Although you can use the Modern C++ style <em>within</em> a thread, when logic and lifetimes are scattered across threads, the hierarchical structure of your program is lost. The tools we use to manage complexity in single-threaded code — in particular, nested lifetimes tied to nested scopes — simply don’t translate to async code.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, let’s look at what happens when we take a simple synchronous function and make it asynchronous.</p>
<pre>void computeResult(State &amp; s);

int doThing() {
  State s;
  computeResult(s);
  return s.result;
}
</pre>
<p><code>doThing()</code> is simple enough. It declares some local state, calls a helper, then returns some result. Now imagine that we want to make both functions async, maybe because they take too long. No problem, let’s use Boost futures, which support continuation chaining:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt; computeResult(State &amp; s);

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  State s;
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [&amp;](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // OOPS
}
</pre>
<p>If you’ve programmed with futures before, you’re probably screaming, <em>“Nooooo!”</em> The <code>.then()</code> on the last line queues up some work to run after <code>computeResult()</code> completes. <code>doThing()</code> then returns the resulting future. The trouble is, when <code>doThing()</code> returns, the lifetime of the <code>State</code> object ends, <em>and the continuation is still referencing it</em>. That is now a dangling reference, and will likely cause a crash.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong? Futures let us compute with results that aren’t available yet, and the Boost flavor lets us chain continuations. But the continuation is a separate function with a separate scope. We often need to share data across those separate scopes. No more tidy nested scopes, no more nested lifetimes. We have to manage the lifetime of the state manually, something like this:</p>
<pre>boost::future&lt;void&gt;
computeResult(shared_ptr&lt;State&gt; s); // addref
                                    // the state

boost::future&lt;int&gt; doThing() {
  auto s = std::make_shared&lt;State&gt;();
  auto fut = computeResult(s);
  return fut.then(
    [s](auto&amp;&amp;) { return s.result; }); // addref
                                       // the state
}
</pre>
<p>Since both async operations refer to the state, they both need to share responsibility to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is: <em>what is the lifetime of this asynchronous computation?</em> It starts when <code>doThing()</code> is called, but it doesn’t end until the continuation — the lambda passed to <code>future.then()</code> — returns. <em>There is no lexical scope that corresponds to that lifetime.</em> And that is the source of our woes.</p>
<h2>Unstructured Concurrency</h2>
<p>The story gets more complicated yet when we consider executors. Executors are handles to executions contexts that let you schedule work onto, say, a thread or thread pool. Many codebases have some notion of an executor, and some let you schedule things with a delay or with some other policy. This lets us do cool things, like move a computation from an IO thread pool to a CPU thread pool, or retry an async operation with a delay. Handy, but like <code>goto</code> it is a very low-level control structure that tends to obfuscate rather than clarify.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently came across an algorithm that uses executors and callbacks (called Listeners here) that retries the async allocation of some resource. Below is a greatly abridged version. It is described after the break.</p>
<pre>// This is a continuation that gets invoked when
// the async operation completes:
struct Manager::Listener : ListenerInterface {
  shared_ptr&lt;Manager&gt; manager_;
  executor executor_;
  size_t retriesCount_;

  void onSucceeded() override {
    /* ...yay, allocation succeeded... */
  }
  void onFailed() override {
    // When the allocation fails, post a retry
    // to the executor with a delay
    auto alloc = [manager = manager_]() {
      manager-&gt;allocate();
    };
    // Run "alloc" at some point in the future:
    executor_.execute_after(
      alloc, 10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount_));
  }
};

// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with the above class as a continuation
void Manager::allocate() {
  // Have we already tried too many times?
  if (retriesCount_ &gt; kMaxRetries) {
    /* ...notify any observers that we failed */
    return;
  }

  // Try once more:
  ++retriesCount_;
  allocator_.doAllocate(
    make_shared&lt;Listener&gt;(
      shared_from_this(),
      executor_,
      retriesCount_));
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>allocate()</code> member function first checks to see if the operation has already been retried too many times. If not it calls a helper <code>doAllocate()</code> function, passing in a callback to be notified on either success or failure. On failure, the handler posts deferred work to the executor, which will call <code>allocate()</code> back, thus retrying the allocation with a delay.</p>
<p>This is a heavily stateful and rather circuitous async algorithm. The logic spans many functions and several objects, and the control and data flow is not obvious. Note the intricate ref-counting dance necessary to keep the objects alive. Posting the work to an executor makes it even harder. Executors in this code have no notion of continuations, so errors that happen during task execution have nowhere to go. The <code>allocate()</code> function can’t signal an error by throwing an exception if it wants any part of the program to be able to recover from the error. Error handling must be done manually and out-of-band. Ditto if we wanted to support cancellation.</p>
<p>This is <strong>unstructured concurrency</strong>: we queue up async operations in an <em>ad hoc</em> fashion; we chain dependent work, use continuations or “strand” executors to enforce sequential consistency; and we use strong and weak reference counts to keep data alive until we are certain it’s no longer needed. There is no formal notion of task A being a child of task B, no way to enforce that child tasks complete before their parents, and no one place in the code that we can point to and say, “Here is the algorithm.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you don’t mind the analogy, the hops through the executor are a bit like <code>goto</code> statements that are non-local in both time and space: “Jump to this point in the program, <em>X</em> milliseconds from now, on this particular thread.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That non-local discontinuity makes it hard to reason about correctness and efficiency. Scale unstructured concurrency up to whole programs handling lots of concurrent real-time events, and the incidental complexity of manually handling out-of-band asynchronous control and data flow, controlling concurrent access to shared state, and managing object lifetime becomes overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>Recall that in the early days of computing, unstructured programming styles rapidly gave way to structured styles. With the addition of coroutines to C++, we are seeing a similar phase shift happening today to our asynchronous code. If we were to rewrite the above retry algorithm in terms of coroutines (using Lewis Baker’s popular <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro">cppcoro</a> library), it might look something like this:</p>
<pre>// Try asynchronously allocating some resource
// with retry:
cppcoro::task&lt;&gt; Manager::allocate() {
  // Retry the allocation up to kMaxRetries
  // times:
  for (int retriesCount = 1;
       retriesCount &lt;= kMaxRetries;
       ++retriesCount) {
    try {
      co_await allocator_.doAllocate();
      co_return; // success!
    } catch (...) {}

    // Oops, it failed. Yield the thread for a
    // bit and then retry:
    co_await scheduler_.schedule_after(
      10ms * (1 &lt;&lt; retriesCount));
  }

  // Error, too many retries
  throw std::runtime_error(
    "Resource allocation retry count exceeded.");
}
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside: This replaces the <code>executor_</code> with a <code>scheduler_</code> that implements cppcoro’s <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro#delayedscheduler-concept">DelayedScheduler</a> concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Attempt One started at 10:30 AM and failed at 1:13 PM. I purposefully took off my blindfold because I was worried that my multiple failures to input my Iphone’s password had resulted in a permanent lock or data wipe. But the password screen was just locked for a minute and all was well.</p>



<p>Given that I failed in the early afternoon, I considered restarting the experiment on another day in the morning. But I had already carved out a 24 hour period when I wouldn’t do any work or be disturbed, and it might have been a week or two longer before I got that opportunity again.</p>



<p>So I checked my messages, briefly went on Reddit, and then restarted.</p>

<p>Attempt Two was successful. I put on my blindfold at 1:23 PM on Thursday, November 5, 2020. I removed it at 1:28 PM on Friday, November 6.</p>



<p>It was an… interesting experience. I don’t recommend it, but I’m glad I did it. I’m not sure where to begin in describing it, especially since I couldn’t take notes, and part of the challenge was being confused. But I’ll do my best to break down the experience.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0818/3417/products/Les_Sublimes_Cashmere_Scarf_Dark_Blue_packshot_2048x.jpg?v=1539973736" alt="Large Cashmere Scarf in Dark Blue | Les Sublimes" width="427" height="427"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Blindfold</span></strong></h2>



<p>To simulate blindness, I used a dark blue scarf as a blindfold. One layer wasn’t quite dark enough, so I folded it in half for extra light defense.</p>



<p>With the blindfold securely on, my vision was the same whether my eyes were open or closed. I kept my eyes closed 99.9% of the time since it was usually more comfortable and helped limit light. I occasionally opened my eyes to check the brightness level and to… I guess you could call it <em>stretch my eyelids.</em> They don’t feel good if you leave them closed for too long.</p>



<p>I couldn’t get a perfect scarf seal around my eyes, so sometimes when I tilted my head back while sitting I noticed a little light come into the bottom of my vision. To limit this, I often pinched the scarf around my nose in that position. But many/most blind people can see some light anyway, so I don’t think this was a significant violation of the experiment.</p>



<p>My eyes got quite dry under the scarf, so I applied moisturizer to this lids and sockets four or five times. I wanted to use eyedrops too, but there was no way to do so without failing the experiment.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Blindness</span></strong></h2>



<p>Initially, everything was black, but as the day went on and the sun went down, I could tell it was nighttime even through two layers of scarf and my eyelids. I’m not sure if I could tell because my eyes had adjusted to become extremely sensitive to light, or if there were other subtle signals (ie. noises, air temperature, circadian rhythms, etc.) which my body picked up on. As evidence of the latter, I could not see any difference between the tv being on or off, nor the refrigerator being opened or closed, even when I was sitting right in front of either.</p>



<p>What I saw depended on how I applied my focus. If I did focus on my vision, I’d see the typical blackness you get from closing your eyes, but it was never perfectly black nor uniform; there was always some odd movement and occasional coloring (whiteness, pale blue, or sometimes red). The most common distortions were a swirling or flowing whiteness, sort of like cream in coffee. I hoped that being blindfolded for so long would make the distortions more extreme, but for the most part it looked no different than what you’d see if you closed your eyes right now for ten minutes.</p>



<p>There was one exception. It must have been about 20+ hours into the experiment, and my eyes were itching, so I rubbed both of them at the same time over the scarf. If you rub your closed eyes and focus on your sight any time you can see some weird stuff, but this was far more extreme than usual. I remember my entire vision filling up with white bubbles which then broke and briefly returned to black. Then white lightning bolt shapes stretched across my sight, expanded to make my vision purely white, and then slowly faded back to black. The strangest thing about it was the <em>brightness</em>. I literally felt like I was staring into lights despite being blindfolded in a dark room. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 30 seconds, but my heart was racing.</p>



<p>More notable than what I saw was what I didn’t see. By default, I was lost in thought and I focused on nothing. In such a state, I didn’t even register my vision or notice the darkness. I <em>think</em> this made my imagination and mental visualization more acute. On occasion, I’d be deep in thought and I’d get the <em>brightness</em> sensation again because I’d be mentally picturing something so vividly that the inevitable return to darkness felt like shutting off the lights in my brain. I’ll explain more about this in the <strong>Three Phases</strong> section.</p>



<p>Sadly, I did not hallucinate, or at least not as far as I could tell.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sloth-sleeping.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1" alt="Fighting Bacteria With Sloth Fur"></figure>



<h2><strong><span>Energy</span></strong></h2>



<p>This was the most surprising aspect of the experiment.</p>



<p>I read that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117902&amp;page=1#:~:text=Without%20light%20cues%20that%20the,as%20a%20result%2C%20researchers%20say.">blind people have trouble getting to sleep</a> because they don’t access any/enough light for their circadian rhythms. I seem to have the exact opposite problem. Without light, my body always thinks it’s time to sleep and has trouble doing anything else. Throughout most of the experiment, I felt extremely lethargic, lazy, and had to fight to stay awake.</p>



<p>I started my first failed experiment attempt at 10:30 AM. I had gotten 7.5 solid hours of sleep, I hadn’t done anything tiring the previous day, and I generally felt fine. Then I put on my blindfold, and within thirty minutes I was nodding off. I semi-slept for two hours before deciding to get an energy drink to get myself out of the funk. That worked, but as soon as it wore off, I was back in semi-sleep mode.</p>



<p>Even when I was firmly awake, I generally felt weak and lethargic. Movement around the apartment was annoying of course, but made so much more difficult by my energy levels. I ended up lying perfectly still in my comfy computer chair with my feet on a table 95% of the time. That is, when I wasn’t lying in bed.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when I removed my blindfold after 24 hours, I experienced a <em>burst</em> of energy. Seriously, it was like I had downed a double shot of espresso. It was like a switch had been flicked. The haziness and cobwebs were gone in an instant, and I felt the energy coursing through my body. I guess light has a big impact on me.</p>

<h2><strong><span>Movement</span></strong></h2>



<p>I moved exactly how you’d expect… clumsily.</p>



<p>For the most part, I slowly walked around my apartment with a hand out to feel for walls and edges. Sometimes I’d get lazy and crawl just so it was easier. I know my apartment well enough that it wasn’t hard to get around, but every once in awhile I’d lose track of where I was and would be left slowly swinging my arm around searching for anything. It’s not a pleasant sensation.</p>



<p>Before the experiment, I had planned to pace around for fun, or maybe even do some exercise with the free time. But the confusion and especially the lethargy stopped all that. I just sat in my chair and didn’t move unless I needed to get a drink, go to the bathroom, or sleep.</p>



<p>I kind of wish I had done the experiment in an unfamiliar environment to add to the movement challenge, but oh well.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/im/99629273/compr-r85/1167/116715839/dual-flush-elongated-one-piece-toilet-seat-included.jpg" alt="DeerValley Dual-Flush Elongated One-Piece Toilet (Seat Included) &amp; Reviews  | Wayfair" width="729" height="729"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Necessities</span></strong></h2>



<p>For food, I ate a big lunch at 10 AM before the experiment and then munched on dark chocolate throughout the night. I felt the heavy lethargy well before the lack of calories was an issue. I probably should have put some prepackaged meals in my fridge to eat, but I was worried about making a mess and not being able to clean up. Do I want ants? Because that’s how I get ants.</p>



<p>For drinks, I could manage to get to the kitchen and fill a cup with water when I needed to. I never took a full cup back to my chair just in case I knocked it over (clean up would be a nightmare). I also had some diet coke to serve as entertainment and put a little caffeine in me.</p>



<p>For the bathroom, I (a man) peed sitting down. I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://imgaz2.staticbg.com/thumb/large/oaupload/banggood/images/F2/09/b934b522-e3e3-491d-b758-d0b92c259f0c.jpg" alt="Novel surreal melting distorted wall clock surrealist salvador dali style  wall clock amazing home decoration gift Sale - Banggood.com" width="802" height="801"></figure></div>



<h2><strong><span>Time</span></strong></h2>



<p>As part of the experiment, I never knew what time it was. This was intended to confuse me throughout the 24 hours, and it did, but it may have helped too. With no sense of time, it was easy to sit back and not think about it. Time drifted by and I existed. That was that.</p>



<p>I actually did ask Siri for the time once… it was late in the experiment, and it felt like I had put on the blindfold forever ago. As you’d expect, …</p></div></article></div>

        <p>tl;dr — If you feel unfocused, grab a pen and paper and start writing your thoughts down.</p>
<p>Is there a question you are stuck on? A ambiguous goal you're trying to accomplish? Maybe a task you know you need to do but from which you keep getting distracted?</p>
<p><strong>Nothing will provide focus like pen and paper.</strong></p>
<p>It's all too easy these days to have a clear intention only to be sidetracked by the whirlpool of apps and services clawing for our attention on our devices.</p>
<p>It helps to take the time to groom our notification settings for importance and timeliness, but a digital device that we can use to complete nearly any task will never stand up to pen and paper in terms of it's ability to provide focus.</p>
<p>My thoughts are a constant whirlwind, I'm certainly more distractible than most, and interacting with nearly any online service only fuels that fire. So how can I get anything done if I'm unable to control my focus?</p>
<p><strong>Pen and paper.</strong> Whenever I catch myself stuck in the whirlpool, feeling not-great because I <em>know</em> I'm not doing what I want to be doing, or what I should be doing, I step away, grab pen and paper, and start writing.</p>
<p>The simple act of writing can focus my thoughts and attention in a way that nothing else can. Free from distractions, just a canvas to pour my thoughts into, and turn them into something with a sense of direction and purpose.</p>
<p>Writing is like a superpower to me. If there's any task I want to accomplish, the first step is always to write it down. Anytime I need to recenter myself on that task, I simply return to paper.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I've found that the simplest solutions are often the most powerful. So far I've found no simpler solution to start tackling any problem than to simply write it down, and then keep on writing.</p>

</p>
<p>this is my personal favorite book on the general math required for machine learning,
   the way things are described really resonate with me.
   available as a free pdf but i got a paper copy to support the authors after reading the
   first half.

</p>
<p>this is gilbert's most recent work. it's really great, he's such a good teacher, and
   <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/">his freely available lectures</a>
   are even better. it's a shorter text than his other classic intro below with
   more of a focus on how things are connected to modern machine learning techniques.

   i've only got the first edition which was R and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBUGS">BUGS</a> but i see
   the second edition is R,
   <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> and
   <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>.
   it'd be fun i'm sure to work through it doing
   everything in <a href="https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro">numpyro</a>. i might do that in all
   my free time. haha. "free time" hahaha. sob.

</p>
<p>this is still one of the most amazing fundamental machine learning books i've ever had.
   in fact i've purchased this book <em>twice</em> and given it away both times :/ i might buy another
   copy some time soon, even though it's been freely available to download for ages. an
   amazing piece of work.

</p>
<p>this is the book i point most people to when they are interested in getting up
   to speed with modern applied machine learning without too much concern for the
   theory. it's very up to date (as much as a book can be) with the latest libraries

   it and support the author. great stuff and, in many ways, a more impactful book than any of
   the theory books here.

<p><b><a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php">Introduction to Data Mining</a>
   by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach &amp; Vipin Kumar</b>
</p>
<p>this is another one that was also on my list from ten years ago and though it's section
   on neural networks is a bit of chuckle these days there is still a bunch of really
   great fundamental stuff in this book. very practical and easy to digest. i also see there's
   a second edition now. i reckon this would compliment the "hands on" book above very well.

<p><b><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/">Speech and Language Processing</a>

</p>
<p>still the best overview of NLP there is (IMHO). can't wait to read the 3rd edition which
   apparently will cover more modern stuff (e.g. transformers) but until then, for the
   love of god though, please don't be one of those "this entire book is
   irrelevant now! just fine tune BERT" people :/

   by Jorge NocedalStephen J. Wright</b>
</p>
<p>this book is super hard core and maybe more an operations
   research book than machine learning. though i've not read it cover to cover the
   couple of bits i've worked through really taught me a lot. i'd love to understand
   the stuff in this text better; it's so so fundamental to machine learning (and more)

</p>
<p>writing a book specifically on deep learning is very dangerous since things move so fast but
   if anyone can do it, ian can... i think ian's approach to explaining neural networks
   from the ground up is one of my favorites. i got the first edition hardback but it's free to
   download from the website.

<p>when i first joined a robotics group i bought a stack of ML/robotics books and this
   was by far the best. it's good intro stuff, and maybe already dated in places given
   it's age (the 2006 edition i have) but i still got a bunch from it.

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This article has made the rounds on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25030938">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jrlxbh/attention_is_my_most_valuable_asset_for/">Reddit</a>. The comments have been fun to read, and while I won’t address them all, I will say this… What I hope readers take away, is to realize just how interrupted and distraction-ridden their day may be, and that it doesn’t have to be that way, that you can improve it. Given that, these methods to guard your attention have worked for me, with “me” being the key word. So, take what’s useful for you, and discard the rest. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>Like a tightly written function, I prefer to exit early if no work should be done. So, if you disagree with these definitions and assumptions, now’s a good time to stop reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable productivity:</strong> The maximum rate of quality work output, without loss to the wellbeing of the developer</li>
<li><strong>Quality work:</strong> Software that meets requirements, is valuable to users, is maintainable, and is as bug free as possible</li>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> The limited mental capacity to focus on a task</li>
<li>Sustainable productivity is desired</li>
<li>Attention is essential to sustainable productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>My high-level workflow looks something like this: identify the problem to solve; think on the problem and let ideas percolate; research, discuss, and experiment with these ideas; implement and test the solution; deliver and maintain the solution.</p>
<p>This cycle could repeat many times in a day. Or I could spend days stuck on a single cycle step. Every step in this cycle requires attention. The more attention I can devote, the more cycles I can complete, and the more productive I am.</p>
<p>How long you can focus on a task varies by person. Some people are very good at it out of the box, some people, not so much. Regardless of the hand you were dealt, I believe that focus (the act of devoting your attention) is a skill, and like any skill, can be improved with practice.</p>
<p>So, how can you increase your attention reserves? The most bang for your buck is to organize your outside world in such a way that it’s distraction free as possible. Once you do that, you’ll have more time to practice, and therefore more time to get better.</p>
<p><strong>Build physical strength.</strong> The damage done by sitting 8+ hours a day is underrated. You need a way to offset this damage, especially if you plan to work in this field for decades. Opinions abound on this topic, but I personally prefer deadlifts. There are few movements more primal than picking a heavy object off the ground and standing up with it. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc">learn correct technique in little time</a>. I most like deadlifts because you can do them safely, at high weights, into old age. I also like the hand, back, and hip strength they give, to make it that much harder for sitting damage to have its way with you.</p>
<p><strong>Make my place of work boring and tidy.</strong> My office is a spare bedroom. The walls are blank. There’s no tv. There’s a desk, chair, laptop, laptop stand, keyboard, mouse, and mouse pad. There’s a window, which lets enough light in so that I don’t feel like I’m missing a beautiful day, but not too much light to cause screen glare. If I need to work with paper, it’s immediately filed somewhere when done.</p>
<p><strong>Make my smart phone dumb.</strong> My phone has all notifications disabled, except for calls and text messages. Well, and National Hurricane Center alerts, since I live in Louisiana. Unless you’re my wife, you know that I don’t respond to text messages immediately, that’s just how it is. I disabled my social media accounts some time ago. But if you have them, turning off notifications should help curve the urge to compulsively check them.</p>
<p><strong>Be an OS minimalist.</strong> Apps I use less commonly are a keypress combo away. Given this, my dock has only the apps I use on a daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>File system explorer</li>
<li>Internet browser</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>Text editor for front-end code and notes</li>
<li>IDE for back-end code</li>
<li>IDE for database</li>
<li>Visual file differ for version control</li>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Instant message client</li>
</ul>
<p>My desktop alternates between clean and dirty states. Files I’m currently working with live on the desktop. Then they’re filed away into sensible folders when done.</p>
<p><strong>Organize my browser bookmarks.</strong> When I read something useful that I may need to reference later, I file it under a general archive folder. Then more specific items get their own folders. Frequently accessed links are visible on my bookmarks bar under their own folder.</p>
<p><strong>Minimize meetings.</strong> Look, I know some things make sense to discuss face to face, or voice to voice. But if they don’t, then you don’t need a meeting. An email or instant message will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">The Eisenhower Method</a> to categorize my tasks.</strong> Imagine a grid of 4 quadrants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important and Not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and Not Urgent</li>
</ul>
<p>Important and Urgent tasks have to be dealt with. For me, these are usually major production issues.</p>
<p>Important and Not Urgent tasks should absorb the bulk of your time. For me, this is the plain old development work of implementing features, fixing bugs, and making existing code more maintainable and performant. Also included are building relationships with others and planning ahead.</p>
<p>Not Important and Urgent tasks are nasty attention thieves. They shout out to you in immediacy, but offer little value in return. You know what these are for you. For me, these are most often lazily asked questions, where the asker did not do their due diligence, and expects a top-notch answer immediately. Also included are last-minute meetings, and over-talkative coworkers.</p>
<p>Not Important and Not Urgent tasks are usually not known to your users. Take internal documentation updates as an example. Thing is, they’re an investment in yourself, which means a more productive future “you”. So don’t forget to show them some love in your spare moments.</p>
<p><strong>Further reading.</strong> If you don’t know who Cal Newport is, you’re missing out. He has a whole blog dedicated to this type of thing, and has written books such as <em>Deep Work</em> and <em>Digital Minimalism</em>. Here are some of my favorite articles by him:</p>
