<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

<li><p><strong>PROCESS</strong> Version numbers are now simply <code><span>X.Y</span></code> where the leading <code><span>1</span></code>
has been dropped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Dropped support for Python 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> Removed the bundle support which was deprecated in
1.4. (#1806)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> File lists generated by <cite>pip show -f</cite> are now
rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
directory lower. (#1933)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
was accidentally lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
that ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE</strong> PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
similarly to before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DEPRECATION</strong> <code><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> and
<code><span>pip</span> <span>wheel</span> <span>--download-cache</span></code> command line flags have been deprecated and
the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
it’s internal HTTP cache which supplants the <code><span>--download-cache</span></code> the
existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="http://alexanderganderson.github.io/static/img/indeterminism.png" alt="two_times_three"></p>

<p>Two times three equals six or at least that’s what I naively expected.</p>

<p>It is well-known that floating point matrix multiplication can result in a variety of <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9911-determinism-in-deep-learning.pdf">surprises</a>.
But did you know that quantized neural networks are not deterministic as well?
A quantized neural network uses integers to
multiply weights and activations in a neural network.
Thus, the naive logic goes, two and three represented and multiplied as integers should always give the exact same result,
namely six.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/neural-networks#validation">Android NNAPI Driver Validation</a> documentation, a
driver is valid if multiplication of quantized tensors is within plus or minus
one bit.</p>



<p>The non-determinism of quantized multiplication is a result of optimizing for
the most common neural network deployment use cases.  Neural networks used for
classification and detection generally work well with small amounts of
non-determinism due to the nature of the mathematical operations involved in
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1IDRdeCW">neural networks</a>. Furthermore, such networks often benefit from training with
some noise (e.g. batch normalization). Likewise, the input to many neural
networks comes from a camera that generates inherently variable images.</p>

<p>The main challenge associated with neural network deployment on the phone
is creating models that are sufficiently fast, power friendly, and small on
disk. Quantizing a neural network helps one improve in all of these categories.
Quantized weights take up less space on disk, take less energy to transfer, and
can be moved more quickly between different levels of memory.</p>

<p>The last issue at play is that it is much cheaper (both in terms of computing
cost and engineering effort) to quantize a pre-trained model than to train an
existing model from scratch. Consequently, the method developed in this
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877">Integer Inference</a> paper
targets quantizing existing models. The key idea is that a floating point
value can be approximated as a scale times a quantized value minus a zero
point. (Also take a look at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_spec">Tensorflow Quantization Spec</a>).
The scale and zero point can be chosen relatively easily by, for
instance, looking at the
range of the weights and activations when evaluating the model on a number of
representative inputs.</p>

<p>The loss in predictive performance due to quantization in many practical use cases is
small and this abstraction is widely implemented and baked into hardware,
for instance, by Qualcomm’ <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>.
[Strictly speaking, the drivers for this hardware could be
changed to ensure determinism, but that may result in a significant loss in
speed at inference time.]
The SNPE was developed and subsequently, Android sought to simplify the process
of deploying neural networks given the wide variety of available
accelerators. The restrictions on the driver tests were relaxed after pushback from
chip manufacturers whose hardware and drivers did not produce deterministic
quantized math.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NN API off by at most 1 (or 3 for a larger network) leaves a
lot of room for funny business that can change the results by small amounts.
The hardware and driver vendors want to produce fast times and low energy
usage numbers on
various neural network benchmarks and are less concerned about reproducibility.
This can lead to unexpected changes in neural network outputs.
For instance, the zero point or scale of the
weights might be changed for some reason by the hardware, and the quantized
values are then recomputed. Another thing that can happen is that the range might
be slightly shifted to make zero exactly representable (see Case 3: Inputs are
both negative and positive in the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>).
Likewise, as the off by one error bound is on a per layer basis, larger
networks generate accumulating error. Practically speaking, the error bound is
increased to three for mobilenet in the NN API driver validation tests. Other
networks could produce larger errors.</p>



<p>The lack of determinism for quantized neural networks touches on the broader
issue of cross platform reproducibility and performance optimization for neural networks.
As the neural networks get deployed more and more widely, these issues will grow in importance.</p>

<p>The first major issue is that if you want to deploy a neural network across
many platforms, you don’t have any guarantees that you are going to get the
same results.
Even if you manage to assemble a large team to test your networks on many
different platforms, the problem isn’t solved.
<em>The lack of determinism means that even if you test your network
on every platform, a driver update may unexpectedly change your results</em>.
This creates an ongoing engineering cost beyond the initial fixed cost of
validating the deployment on existing hardware.</p>

<p>The next major issue is that some application areas have more stringent
standards in terms of reproducibility and auditability. Suppose that a neural
network is used in a self-driving car that gets in an accident. For auditing
purposes, it is important to be able to replay the decisions made by the car’s
control system exactly. In the best case, this requires a significant
engineering effort to keep track of all of the driver versions and internal
testing to verify reproducibility for any deployment.</p>

<p>The final issue is that while classification and detection are not particularly
sensitive to small changes in output, the lack of determinism makes it more
challenging to deploy neural network models which are deeper or more sensitive to
changes.  For instance, imagine a language model that is unrolled over many
iterations to parse or generate a sentence. In that case, accumulating errors
could cause unexpected results.</p>



<p>In the past couple years, there has been an explosion of experimentation in
neural network deployment from software frameworks to hardware
accelerators.  As the field matures, questions about best practices will slowly
be answered. The ability to <em>train once, deploy anywhere</em> will become easier
and easier. In the particular case of determinism, the most reasonable next
step is to have a driver test that ensures determinism and publish a list of
vendors that implement a deterministic API.</p>

<p>The question of determinism is only one small part of the puzzle of being able
to deploy anywhere. Another subtle but important issue is that different
operations will run faster on different hardware. Even if a network can deploy
anywhere in a reproducible manner, an even more fundamental issue is whether
or not a network will be fast and power efficient on any platform. Indeed, while there
has been a great amount of progress in the field of neural network
deployment, there is much to be done to make the ecosystem easier to use and
more mature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>This was initially written for my regular column in the
Brown Computer Science departmental magazine, <span>conduit!</span>,
for the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/about/conduit/conduit_v12n2.pdf">Fall 2003
issue</a>. I think it’s far too much fun to leave hidden in such an obscure place.
The prose is unchanged since then (so some of the classification information
may well be incorrect); only the marginal notes are new.</span></p><p>The sender’s name was in all-upper-case, and the subject
line read, “Not exactly...”.</p><p>Spam.</p><p>But I’m glad I opened it anyway. “This is not exactly your
normal query...”, the message
body began. It was from an upstanding citizen at the NASA
Johnson Space Center, asking
for... the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for
DrScheme<span><span><span>Now <a href="https://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>.</span></span></span>, a Scheme programming environment I
helped develop.</p><p>The what for what?!?</p><p>It transpires that a tasteful astronaut (name withheld to protect the innocent) had loaded
DrScheme on his laptop for use during his free
time in space.<span><span><span>Turns out he was working through <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span>.</span></span></span>
He was (a) going to be on the International Space Station (ISS) and (b) launching a
hard drive image from Russia. The ISS is a multinational enterprise and Russia is, well, another
country, so the act of sending software in both instances involves an export. Both, consequently,
need an ECCN. (I wonder if there is some tacit assumption here that outer space, or at least the ISS,
is a foreign land. I wonder if there isn’t some
group squirreled away trying to determine the
equivalent of nautical limits in space.)</p><p>The US government does a remarkably good job
of publishing documents on the Web; anyone
who’s had to deal with the IRS or the lucky few
who’ve had to contend with the INS will grudgingly admit this. These are sometimes no more
than OCR-scanned copies, but the scanning yields
enough clarity that Google can find the documents. I can’t begin to imagine what this process
must have been like ten years ago. (Probably a lot
simpler: I’d have written off for an official document, then returned to my regularly scheduled
work.)</p><p>Anyway, accessing prose is not the same as understanding it. The second paragraph of the first document I read began “The CCL is contained in
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR.”</p><p>It was going to be that kind of day.</p><p>I have some layman’s thoughts about such prose.
It doesn’t look like natural language at all. I conjecture it’s because natural language is rife with
anaphoric references. Letting context and a rich
language of reference “do the talking” leads to
higher communication bandwidth, but it’s hell on
disjointed documents.... But this is beginning to
read like one of Eugene’s<span><span><span>That would be natural-language processing maestro
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Charniak">Eugene Charniak</a>, who had a regular column in <span>conduit!</span> that was
the inspiration for mine.</span></span></span> articles, so I should stop
this digression now.</p><p>The ECCN system is quite simple once you get
the hang of it. Numerous artifacts, from nuclear to
software, are given codes such as 14D993. These
codes determine the range of permitted distribution and the licensing demands on those who wish
to acquire them. Everything else is assigned the
default code EAR99, sometimes designated NLR
(No License Required). So it’s simply a matter of
reading enough documentation, slotting your
product, and finding a code. This is a bit like saying that feeding your pet octopus is simply a matter of pulling aside the arms, placing the food in
the middle, then retracting your limb. Easily done,
but you may lose an organ or two getting the hang
of it.</p><p>Reading these documents was not without its rewards. I discovered, for instance, that EAR 740.13
(d) (3) (ii) (A) differs from EAR 774 Supplement
No. 2 (2) (a), though they describe the same thing.
The former document is dated later, yet leaves out
a key provision included in the latter, the recognition that software may be sold electronically! Better still, I found that ECCN category 14D993
specifically restricts the export of “program”
proof and validation “software” using mathematical and analytical techniques and designed or
modified for “programs” having more than
500,000 “source code” instructions. Beware, all
you verification researchers—don’t get too ambitious!</p><p>Having done my research, I determined that we
fall under License Exception TSU (Technology
and Software — Unrestricted), though it all gets a
bit sketchy here because our software is not specifically sold. (The concept of free software
doesn’t seem to be in the ECCN vocabulary.
Cheap political crack omitted here.) This didn’t
necessarily mean we were EAR99, and EAR99 is
an ECCN, whereas TSU isn’t, and NASA had
asked for an ECCN. Mustering great courage, I
called the encouragingly named Outeach and Educational Services Division of the US Commerce
Department. After only a few minutes, I was connected to a gruff counselor.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I was hoping to get a quick clarification
on an ECCN classification.”</p><p>(gruffer still) “Yes?”</p><p>(deep breath) “If I find that my product falls under
License Exception TSU under part 774 of the
EAR, can I assume it has the ECCN of EAR99?”</p><p>I believe I did this without inhaling.</p><p>These are the moments that test the mettle of great
men. Like Major Major’s father, my counselor
was made of stern stuff. He paused for just a moment, just long enough to
accord respect to someone he clearly perceived to be a fellow numbers-and-policy wonk. And then, in a voice rich in
cameraderie, he said, “You know, I’ve been trying
to determine that for five years myself!”</p><p>Being excepted from a license was not the same as
not requiring a license? In the logic of the US government, did the Law of the Excluded Middle not
apply? What was the difference between the two?</p><p>Syria.</p><p>No, seriously. The difference really is Syria. TSU
permits export to Syria, but EAR99 does not.</p><p>My counselor told me this with glee. Apparently I
had hit on one of his favorite trivia questions, because, now really warming to the topic, he informed me that he had asked this very question of
many of his colleagues. Some had incorrectly
identified the two; others, quicker on the draw,
had said that they were indeed different but had
recommended the use of ECCN 4D994. As everyone knows — shucks, by this point even I knew —
this was a contemptible response, because 4D994
permits the export of only specific software products. And so on.</p><p>Anyway, this story has a happy ending. We appear
to meet EAR99. NASA Johnson has acknowledged receipt of our ECCN. I’ve been in touch
with the fine astronaut. DrScheme will soon be
happily beta-v-cs-reducing expressions in outer
space.</p><p>Where has your programming language been today?</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter</a> for sneak peaks and updates!</p>



<div><p>I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch – they were listed as broken and I believe they are customer returns. They are all Model B’s with with either 256MB or 512MB of RAM and are in various conditions. </p><p>The first step in repairing these is to diagnose the issues, I created some tooling to assist with this which I will cover now.</p></div>



<h2>Pi Diagnostics</h2>



<p>So how do you go around diagnosing 200+ faulty Raspberry Pi’s? Regardless of how clever I get around this its not going to be a fast process but I needed a plan. </p>



<div><p>I will be categorising the Pi’s into two categories those that boot and those that are or appear dead. The “Dead” Pi’s will be revisited at a later date but lets take a look at how I’ve gone about testing the ones that boot up. </p><p>Using a cheap 3.5″ TFT Pi display and a hacky bash script I have created a diagnostic tool that will test the following: </p></div>



<ul><li>USB Ports</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>Display Output</li></ul>



<p>This also gives me an opportunity to test the GPIO to an extent as the display uses the I2C, VCC and GND pins and also gives me a chance to assess the physical condition of the device. </p>

<p>So far I am around half way through the diagnostics and 59 of the Pi’s boot and work with minor damage such as snapped SD card slots or physically damaged USB ports.</p>



<p>10 of the Pi’s are fully working although their is no Ethernet – These will not be fixed as such although the Ethernet chip and port will be removed transforming the device into a Model A. </p>



<div><p>A further 4 devices are fully working although the HDMI port doesn’t work, all 4 of these look to have damaged traces on the PCB around the HDMI circuitry – I will not be fixing these although I can make them safe to run headless. </p><p>A further 40 Pi’s are dead although some of them are likely just broken power delivery circuits which should be easy fixes – I will revisit these in the near future. </p><p>Here are the remaining devices that need to be diagnosed: </p></div>

<div><p>Over the next few days I will diagnose the remaining devices and add a follow up post that will have a total count of Pi’s in the box and a count of the ones that I believe are repairable. </p></div>



<h2>Repairing the Pi’s</h2>



<p>Although I haven’t finished diagnosing the Pi’s I couldn’t help but repair a few of the easier fixes, lets look at a few repairs I carried out this morning.</p>



<h3>Bent GPIO pins</h3>

<p>How the hell does this happen?! one of the Pi’s had the GPIO pins swashed flat. I could have replaced the header but as no pins were snapped I carefully straightened them a metal ruler. <br></p>

<p>Ok broken is an understatement! This poor Pi has had the ports ripped right off it, fortunately there is plenty dead Pi’s that will not be fixable so rather than buying parts I salvaged the USB ports from a dead Pi. </p>

<p>There we have it, another Pi saved from the scrap pile! </p>



<p>I know people are excited to see the board level repairs but I can assure that they are coming, there are just a lot of devices to go through and I want to get the easy fixes out of the way first. <br></p>



<div><p>I fixed several with broken USB ports and added them to the box of working Pi’s. I will be covering SD card slot repairs when my AliExpress parts arrive but for now this is all on the repairs. </p><p>Here is a final photo showing the so-far working devices: </p></div>

<h2>What am I going to do with 200 Raspberry Pi’s?!</h2>



<p>I’m sorry to disappoint but I won’t be building a cluster or decorating my walls with them! In fact I don’t have a project planned for these instead they will be sold on starting at £4 for a “Model A” and up to £9 for a fully boxed un-repaired Model B. I’m not doing this to make a quick buck I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!</p>



<p>I had a lot of suggestions to send the Pi’s to a developing Country for students to learn IT on and whilst I really like that idea the logistics of it and finding someone trustworthy enough to hand them out aren’t straight forward. Then there is the issue or 200 Pi’s requiring SD cards, Keyboards, Mice and Displays A board alone just isn’t enough here and its just not simple or easy for me to do. Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money! </p>



<p>I will post an update tomorrow with the results of the diagnostics and a link where you can purchase the repaired devices – UK only though I’m afraid unless you are willing to cover the shipping. </p>



<p>Let me know what you think of this mammoth task in a comment below and please consider following this blog for updates. </p>



<p>Edit: 24/01/21<br>Part 2 is now out <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-2/">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Consensus algorithms is a topic that always caught my attention: it is complex and hard and needs a precise and safe solution. In other words: We have a couple of machines forming a cluster, and they operate on identical copies of the same data and can continue operating even in the scenario of some servers being down. This approach is used to solve a bunch of problems in distributed systems.</p>

<p>To give a bit of background of where we currently stand, we have to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. Over the past decade or more, Paxos was almost synonymous with consensus, as it is the protocol taught in most computer science courses, and most implementations of consensus make use of it. The only problem is that Paxos is really difficult to understand, thus making it very hard to be implemented correctly. With that, Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">designed Raft</a>, with the most important goal of making it understandable.</p>

<p>Given that Raft focuses so much on understandability, it breaks down the consensus into three relatively independent subproblems (quoting the Raft paper):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader election: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails.</li>
  <li>Log replication: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with their own</li>
  <li>Safety: if any server has applied a given log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, I will cover only the Leader election. The other two topics I will cover in the future in other blog posts!</p>

<h3 id="the-basics-of-raft-and-leader-election">The basics of Raft and leader election</h3>

<p>A Raft cluster is composed of several servers and five is a typical number, therefore allowing the system to have two failures. A server in this cluster is in one of three possible states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader: Handles all client requests.</li>
  <li>Followers: are passive, and only respond to requests from leaders.</li>
  <li>Candidate: a state used to elect a new leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, and they are numbered with consecutive integers. Each one of these terms starts with an election, where one or more candidates attempt to become the leader of the cluster. When a candidate wins the election, it serves as the leader for the rest of the term. To explain this process a bit better, we can illustrate these transitions.</p>

<p><img src="http://laurocaetano.com/images/raft-states-2.png" alt="raft-states"></p>

<p>Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger elections. When a server joins the cluster, they begin as followers, and they remain in this state as long as they receive valid heartbeats from the current leader. The leaders send periodic heartbeats to all followers in order to notify them of the existence of it and maintain its authority. When a follower does not receive a heartbeat over a period of time, named in Raft “election timeout”, then it proceeds to start a new election.</p>

<p>A new election follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changing the state from follower to candidate</li>
  <li>Increase the current term by 1</li>
  <li>Votes for itself</li>
  <li>Requests votes from all servers in the cluster</li>
  <li>If the server gets the majority of the votes, it assumes the role of leader</li>
  <li>Starts sending heartbeats to all followers, including the new term</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very simplistic and short explanation for the leader election process, and for more details do not hesitate in <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">reading the paper</a>! It’s a very pleasant read.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-in-rust">Implementation in Rust</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a programming language designed for performance, safety, and safe concurrency. It is strongly typed, compiled, has no garbage collector, and has no runtime (a.k.a a very minimal runtime).</p>

<p>I got interested in Rust at the end of 2020, by reading a couple of blog posts. With that trigger, I decided to read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">The Rust Programming Language</a> book and started to code very small projects. Only that very small projects do not tell you much about the language in the real world. So I decided to implement something that is more related to what I work on on my daily basis: dealing with distributed systems.</p>

<p>Note: if you are not familiar with the language, you can quickly check <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/">the Gentle intro to Rust</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

<p>I decided to use the most simple and basic constructs of the language. This means no big runtimes, libs that do most of the job and etc. So I ended up using only threads for concurrency, and TCP for the RPCs.</p>

<h5 id="reproducing-the-states-and-types-in-the-code">Reproducing the states and types in the code</h5>

<p>My initial approach was to find out which types were the most important ones, and reproduced them in the code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Examples of types.</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>State</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LEADER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>CANDIDATE</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>LogEntry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span> <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
    <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>,</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogEntry</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Peer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Instant</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
    <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Leader</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Visit the file "types.rs" in the repo to see the all type definition.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And once my types were defined, I started to implement the state transitions step by step.</p>

<h5 id="a-server-starts-as-follower">A server starts as follower</h5>

<p>In order to reproduce this behavior, I implemented a <code>new</code> method inside <code>Server</code>, to ensure that all servers are started with this state.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>
        <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
        <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
        <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
            <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
            <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span>
            <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>number_of_peers</span><span>,</span>
            <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a server that starts as follower! Let’s go and implement the rest of the state transitions.</p>

<h5 id="starting-an-election-when-a-timeout-occurs">Starting an election when a timeout occurs</h5>

<p>As mentioned before, a server in Raft times out when it does not receive a heartbeat from a leader in a predetermined amount of time. Each server has a randomized timeout setting, to ensure that servers time out at different times.</p>

<p>To implement that, I decided to do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The final implementation is not exactly like this,</span>
<span>// but the idea is the same.</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>server</span><span>.has_timed_out</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>new_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have a thread that runs an infinite loop, always checking for the server’s timeout. Whenever it occurs, a new election is triggered.</p>

<p>The election process, in the happy path, occurs as follow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 1. Changing the state from follower to candidate</span>
<span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>CANDIDATE</span><span>;</span>

<span>// 2. Increase the current term by one</span>
<span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>server</span><span>.refresh_timeout</span><span>();</span>

<span>// 3. Vote for itself</span>
<span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Peer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.address</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>// 4. Prepare vote requests and make the RPC request</span>
<span>let</span> <span>request_vote_rpc</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>VoteRequest</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>new_term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>candidate_id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>let</span> <span>rpc_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rpc_client</span><span>.request_vote</span><span>(</span><span>request_vote_rpc</span><span>);</span>

<span>// 5. if the server gets the majority of votes, becomes leader</span>
<span>if</span> <span>has_won_the_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>rpc_response</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// 6. sends heartbeats to all followers</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>log_entry</span> <span>=</span> <span>LogEntry</span><span>::</span><span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span><span>,</span>
        <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>rpc_client</span><span>.broadcast_log_entry</span><span>(</span><span>log_entry</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="election-timeout-and-discovering-another-leader">Election timeout and discovering another leader</h5>

<p>In case a timeout occurs or the server does not get the majority of the votes, it will start the election once again, increasing the term once more. In Raft, it is totally fine to have terms without a leader.</p>

<p>Another interesting case can occur during the election process: another server in the cluster is elected, and starts sending heartbeats. When this occurs, our server changes back the state from <code>CANDIDATE</code> to <code>FOLLOWER</code>, and set the terms to the current leader’s term.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example of how a server behaves when receiving heartbeats</span>
<span>// It becomes a follower if the received heartbeat has a higher</span>
<span>// term than itself.</span>

<span>if</span> <span>term</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>info!</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"Server {} becoming follower. The new leader is: {}"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span>
    <span>);</span>

    <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>term</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server</span><span>.current_leader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Leader</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that, we have covered all the steps for the state transitions in Raft’s leader election algorithm!</p>

<h5 id="more-info-about-the-full-implementation">More info about the full implementation</h5>

<p>The core logic for the leader election is implemented in the <code>raft::core</code> package, where functions to handle log entries (heartbeats), elections, and timeouts are placed. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/core.rs">full implementation</a> for a more detailed look into the code.</p>

<p><em>Important notes</em></p>

<p>RPCs are done through TCP connections. Each server starts up with a TPC listener, and create client connections to all other servers in the cluster.</p>

<p>The implementation is not making usage of persistent storage, so all operations are done in memory. For this reason, the <code>Server</code> instance is shared across many functions, by making usage of Rust’s <code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code> combination. It took me a while to understand the concepts, but once you get the basics, it turns out very simple!</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/demo.rs">demo</a>, which runs and demonstrates the process of electing a leader in a new cluster. By running it, we get the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>22:46:10 [INFO] Starting server at: 127.0.0.1:3300...

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/graphics/Verdana_I.gif">
n a recent interview, Bill Zeitler, IBM's General Manager for the AS/400 Division, was asked a very blunt question: What are you betting the AS/400 business on today?  His answer, in all of two words, was "Network Computing".  In the next breath, he explained that he wasn't just talking about connectivity, but about conducting business electronically, over the Internet, and largely by virtue of a superior Java environment.

</p><p>
It's remarkable to think that IBM is basing so much of its future on, of all things, a programming language, and on a programming language that not only didn't exist a few years ago, but also was developed by an IBM competitor, Sun Microsystems.  What on earth could a new programming language offer to merit such attention?  Some new killer op-code?  A revolutionary new way to program a do-loop?

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1. ">

</p><p>
The answer is that there is not much in the Java language itself to write home about - it is a slightly simplified and streamlined version of C++, with some features that make it suitable for running applications over a network - the Internet, for an obvious example.  However, Java does have the revolutionary attribute of being hardware platform and operating system independent: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" is the battle cry of the Java faithful, and when you think about it, it certainly would change the industry landscape if hardware platforms and their respective operating systems became the handmaidens of applications, not vice versa.  Put a Java applet on your Web page, and it can be used, unchanged, by a Windows user in Buenos Aires, a Mac bigot in Australia, a Unix nut in Sweden, and an OS/2 diehard in Singapore (and all this with no royalties accruing to Microsoft!)

</p><p>
Thus, Java has the potential, at least, to break the hold that the hardware and operating system monoliths have on the computer world, and could make hardware and software tycoons like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as obsolete in the 21st century as railway barons have become in the 20th.  From IBM's point of view, if business application software were uncoupled from hardware platforms and operating systems, then computer systems could be sold on their own merits - robustness, security, manageability, etc. - and IBM no doubt feels that with the AS/400 they can compete quite well on that playing field.

</p><p>
Computer industry geopolitics aside, Java has become the Next Big Thing in the computer field - and if you're not constantly eager to get in on the Next Big Thing (even before you've fully mastered the Previous Three Big Things), then why the heck did you choose this industry to work in!

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-2.jpg" alt="Figure 2. ">

</p><p>
Since Java was introduced by Sun Microsystems, the Java Development Kit (JDK) has been available to be downloaded free over the Internet.  The JDK (now at version 1.1) includes a Java compiler, an applet viewer, and standard class libraries.  However, it is strictly command line based.  If you want to design the graphical interface of your application on-screen, as well as take advantage of the other benefits of graphical integrated development environments, you have to open your wallet a bit and look at something like Borland's JBuilder, Microsoft's Visual J++, or Symantec's Visual Café.  Or, as of July 25, IBM's Visual Age for Java.

</p><p>
The latest in IBM's Visual Age series of development environments had been available in a beta test version for several months, but recently Version 1.0 was officially released.  It's available in two flavours: the Professional Edition, and the pricier Enterprise Edition, which adds support for team development, as well as "Enterprise Access Builders" - tools for developing components to connect a Java client to various database platforms.  Within the Visual Age for Java environment you can create both applications and "applets" - Java programs that can be embedded in an HTML document and run by Web browsers which implement the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  (Note that Visual Age for Java includes its own JVM as well as an applet viewer, so you can view and test your programs locally).  VA for Java also has a version control capability, and a debugger is included.

</p><p>
The Professional Edition is priced to compete with its counterparts mentioned above - that is, in the 100 - 200 dollar range per license.  However, if even that amount is a deterrent to you, the neophyte dabbler in Java, you may be interested to know that you can download a free copy of the Entry Edition - which contains all the functionality of the Professional Edition, minus only the documentation and online help, and limited to the creation of 100 classes.  In the remainder of this article, I'll show how you can download and install the Entry Edition of Visual Age for Java, and have a quick look at some of its features.

</p><p>
First, you'll have to consider the prerequisites, which are pretty significant, particularly for RAM.  You'll need Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or OS/2 Warp V4, an SVGA display, and, IBM says, 32MB of RAM (with 48MB recommended), at least 45MB of free disk space for the software (with an additional 30MB free disk space for swapping), and lastly, an unzip program.

</p><p>
If you're still standing, here's where you can find the Entry Edition on the Internet: <a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava" target="_blank"> www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava</a>.  (Before downloading it, you should uninstall any Beta versions of the product from your system).  The Windows version of the download file (wenty100.ZIP) is a single .ZIP file almost 22MB in size - so you'll finally be able to wallpaper that bathroom while it's downloading.  Download it into a temporary directory, then unzip it.  One of the unzipped files is a setup.exe file, which can be invoked to complete the installation.  There is also an install.txt file with further installation and troubleshooting information.
After a successful installation, you'll have an "IBM Visual Age for Java" icon on your desktop to invoke the program.  It will bring up the Workbench window seen in Figure 1.  It will also bring up the "Quick Start" window seen in Figure 2 (which also can be brought up at any time from the Window… Quick Start… menu option).  If you select to create a new applet, as shown, you will be taken to a Smart Guide window (comparable to a Windows 95 "wizard"), which prompts you for applet name, project, and package, and whether you want to design the applet visually, or write source code for it.  If you select the former, the Visual Composition Editor is invoked (Figure 3).

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3. ">

</p><p>
The Visual Composition Editor allows you to create a graphical interface, with all the usual components - buttons, lists, menus, entry fields, etc., which it calls (in yet another of those coffee metaphors which are already becoming tiresome) "beans".  These are selectable from the left hand side of the window.  Beyond just laying out an application window, basic application logic can be constructed by making connections between components in the window (marked out with the dashed line), or with non-visual components outside the window.  In the example shown, the Remove button has been connected to the list, to indicate that clicking Remove should delete the highlighted item from the list.  The source code for this event logic is then generated automatically.
With Version 1.0, "beans" for all the standard Java Class Libraries are available.  In future, more sophisticated - and AS/400-specific - components will accessible, allowing, for example, access to files and fields in DB2/400, analogous to using externally described files in RPG/400.

</p><p>
Regardless of how many pre-built components, or "beans", are available, there will always be a requirement for new classes in any custom application.  VA for Java of course enables the creation of such classes in the old fashioned way - typing source code - with Smart Guides that prompt you and provide some of the fundamental class definition code.  And even if you are programming the old fashioned way, the VA for Java environment makes life easier by making instantly accessible the definitions of all the classes on the system and their methods, organized by their respective packages, whether standard Java classes or your own previously created classes (see again Figure 1).  If, like me, you've tried to learn and program Java from one of the many books available today, you may have been frustrated by not having access to such comprehensive documentation of the numerous standard Java classes.

</p><div><p>
What I've given above is just a quick overview of IBM's Java development environment - and admittedly not much reference is made to where the AS/400 comes into all this.  The AS/400, as of V3R7, does not currently natively support Java applications - a coming release of OS/400 will rectify that.  And as of the time of writing this article, much of the AS/400-specific Java development capability is still under construction.  In future articles, I hope to explore more AS/400-related capabilities of Java as they become available.  In the meantime, the latest scoop from IBM is of course available on the Internet, at www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava.

					February 2019 â€” I created this document from a collection of memories of a particular time in my life.  It is accurate to the best of my memory, but that does not mean it is complete.  Still, I think itâ€™s worth making public because there is almost no similar information on the intarwebs.
				</p>
				<p>
					If youâ€™re here to read about the TRS-80 Model 100 computer, you will have to slog through a lot of background information and personal anecdotes.  I didnâ€™t write this for clicks, or popularity, or recognition.  I wrote it for my own edification.  And I wrote the text of it on a TRS-80 Model 100.

			<h2>
				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many TRS-80â€™s in the world. But this one is mine.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg" alt="My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story."></a>

			<p>
				The TRS-80 Model 100 is claimed by some to be the worldâ€™s first portable computer.  Whether that is true or not is hard to say.  Ninety percent of online journalism these days is nothing more than wannabe reporters summarizing other peopleâ€™s assumptions from web sites that know how to game a search engine.  But looking at old magazines of its era, the Model 100 was at least the first portable computer that wasnâ€™t a glorified calculator, or a suitcase so hefty that you could chock a tire with it to keep a Greyhound bus from rolling away.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document exists to show that the urban legend about TRS-80's being the devices that ushered journalism into the modern age is true. The Model 100 was a workhorse for a number of journalists, including a cadre of  roving correspondents for the Associated Press.  And also for me: a cub reporter for a radio station in a medium-sized, unremarkable city.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was a city not unlike dozens of other river towns across the United States.  For me, it wasnâ€™t my first experience as a broadcast journalist, but it was my first full-time, all-on-my-own job hundreds of miles from home.  More importantly, it was my first job with a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conventional wisdom is that the computer revolution came all at once, and from the top down; with big businesses investing in hardware and software to make their employees more productive.  But it was a two-pronged offense.
			</p>
			<p>
				While desktop computers were commonplace in large companies in large office towers in large cities, it took decades for computers to become everyday objects in 90% of America.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second prong came from that 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the country, computers were becoming regular fixtures in ordinary households.  Commodore 64â€™s, TI99/4Aâ€™s, Apple ][â€™s and the like opened up a new world of possibilities for Joe and Jane Lunchbucket, and their children.  Online services like CompuServe, QLink, The Source, and Delphi connected people to information and each other in ways that previous generations could only imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was also unimaginable to many of the people running the companies for which these people worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even as late as the turn of the millennium, it was commonplace for someone to have a computer and online connection at home that was faster and better than what was available in their workplace.  Complaints about this upside-down situation put pressure on small and mid-sized companies to land computers on every desk.  Firms like Dell, Gateway 2000 and eMachines were happy to churn out millions of low-quality â€œbusiness" computers to fill this technology gap.
			</p>
			<p>
				This story starts during the early portion of that gap.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Work before computers
			</h2>
			<p>
				I had a computer at home.  It was home-built, which wasnâ€™t unusual for the time.  But at work, it was all typewriters and pencils.  So many pencils.  I often wondered if it would make sense for all the reporters to put their pencils in a big communal bucket and have the interns sharpen them at the beginning of each work day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to pencils, the primary tools of the reporterâ€™s trade were reporter notepads.  These are special spiral-bound pads of lined paper that are unusually narrow and unusually long.  They are the perfect size for stuffing into the inside pocket of a suit jacket or the outside pocket of a trench coat.  Each big story got its own pad, and youâ€™d build up a library of pads as an archive you could reference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reporter pads were more than utilitarian.  They helped define the local journalism hierarchy.  Interns and reporters for alternative rags carried steno pads.  Real journalists had real reporter notepads from real journalism supply companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				But there was another level in the notepad caste system.  If you were lucky enough to be in the presence of a network correspondent, or someone working for one of the broadsheet institutions, you might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their special reporter notepads.  These looked like the regular notepads that plebs like myself used.  But their companies were so professional, and so focused on making sure their people had everything they needed to do a good job that the notepads had the company logos stamped on the cover.  It was like bird watching for news nerds.  A big black CBS eye here. An academic maroon AP logo there.  A corporate blue UPI logo could be spied if you were very lucky.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as important as paper were the pencils a reporter carried.  Pens were right out.  If a pen dries up, explodes in your pocket, or otherwise refuses to cooperate, youâ€™re screwed.  A pencilâ€™s point might break, but you could pop into any random office building and ask the first secretary you came across to use her sharpener.  Plus, you always carried a fistful of spares.  In the worst case scenario, you could use a random sharp implement to expose enough lead to scratch with.  We all envisioned a story that was so important weâ€™d have to gnaw the wood off the end of a pencil just to make sure we didnâ€™t miss that career-making quote.

				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-008.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-008.jpeg" alt="Teletype paper from 1983"></a>
				<figcaption>Teletype paper was never meant to last more than a few hours or days.  This is from 1983.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the radio newsroom, an intermittent tide of information came in on an Associated Press teletype machine.  It was something that looked like it belonged on the deck of a battleship spewing hot lead at airborne foes.  Two or three times a day someone would search through the ribbon of paper it spit onto the floor, rip each story from the spool, and file the stories into wire baskets labeled â€œLocal,â€� â€œState,â€� and â€œNational.â€�  There was also a â€œSaveâ€� bin way off to the side where people could collect copies of important news alerts and bulletins for posterity or their own personal collections.  International news went into the trash bins.  Thatâ€™s what we had the national network for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thatâ€™s not to say that we didnâ€™t know what was going on.  At that level, all reporters are experts on national issues and foreign affairs.  Just ask them.  It was a game of one-upmanship that we all played to feed the fantasy that we might get a call from the network to join the big leagues in New York or D.C.  Which almost never happened.  No matter how much you contributed, you were more likely to squeeze into one of the few desirable slots at Voice of America than to be remembered by the network editors at Black Rock for more than six seconds after your voice left their air.
			</p>
			<p>
				But while we had pencils and we had paper and we had teletype machines, what we didnâ€™t have were computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In school the boys didnâ€™t learn how to type.  That was for girls.  But since I had a computer at home, I knew my way around a keyboard.  You couldnâ€™t get a journalism degree without being able to bang out 40 words per minute on an IBM Selectric.  My scores were consistently above 80.  My J-school professors thought I was cheating.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I started my career, my home base was an AM/FM combo in the center of a small market.  Since I wasnâ€™t a full-time employee, I was free to work elsewhere.  And I did.  I would do a day at this station to fill in for someone who was sick, or a week at that station so someone could go on vacation.  At the time, it was very unusual for a local radio station to not have news at least once an hour.  Automation existed, but the spinning wheels of carts stopped when it was time for news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doing news after school and on weekends helped pay for college.  To make that happen I got myself on the fill-in sheets of half the radio stations within 200 miles of where I lived.  Doing so allowed me to list more than a dozen commercial stations on my resume at a point in my career when my peers were lucky to get a DJ shift at a carrier current college station.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was bouncing between so many stations that one day I did, regrettably, announce that â€œKOJ news time is 7:05â€� on a station that wasnâ€™t KOJ.  The good people at K-104 never asked me back, which was a shame.  It was the first place I ever considered working full-time.  The facilities at K-104 were terrible.  But that was because management invested money in the employees instead of the physical plant, and everyone was paid far above what the competition paid.  The result was that everyone worked hard, and we were all handsomely rewarded.  But after my on-air mistake, I decided it was time to find one job, and stick to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came time for a career change, I did what all radio people did: I consulted the help wanted listings in a strange industry newsletter that came in every day by fax.  Some station managers would tear the want ads off the end of the transmissions.  It was a very effective way to keep people from jumping ship in an era when information was still easy to control.  But if you were on the morning shift, you came in six hours before sales and management. That gave you an …</p></section></div>

<hr>

<p>A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a $124$M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and layer-wise parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters in the model from $124$M to around $12$M.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn’t perform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of “research project” that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the $124$M parameter version of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>. I wanted to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time. A $100$k iteration training run takes about $20$ hours to run which gave me plenty of time to run multiple experiments. In contrast, following OpenAI’s training procedure exactly and training for the full $800$k iterations would take up almost an entire week and use up most of my quota.</p>

<p>I was able to almost replicate the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ perplexity (ppl) on the standard OpenWebText dataset compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model),</p>

<p>My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn’t really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about $20$ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this anyway.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>A little bit about myself: I’m an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I’m currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on colab for a new project that I’m working on).</p>

<p>I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">word2vec</a> and LSTMs were SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it has been really interesting to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handful of layers and somewhere on the order of $512$ units were considered to be large networks and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">attention</a> layers on top, to the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer encoder/decoder networks</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFIT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMO</a>, then <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a>, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/">Sparse Transformer</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743">Synthesizers</a>, and now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today.</p>

<p>I’ve rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> is a transformer decoder.</p>

<p>The embedding layer at the root of the model maps a one-hot vector of a given token’s index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of $50257$) to a $768$ dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the $124$m parameter version of GPT-2).</p>

<p>The embedding matrix is followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a $768$ dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant), which makes up the main part of the transformer.</p>

<p>The stack of self-attention layers is then followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the $768$ dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same $50257$ dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT-2</a> for a more in-depth look into GPT-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942">ALBERT</a> (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="factorized-embedding">
Factorized embedding</h3>

<hr>

<p>GPT-2’s embedding has a lot of parameters. It’s really just a matrix of dimensions $50257 \times 768$. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost $50257 \times 768 = \space \sim 38,000,000$ parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the $128$M total parameters in the model.</p>

<p>The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of $128$: one embedding of size $50257 \times 128$ and another embedding of size $128 \times 768$. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about $38$M to about $6$M.</p>

<p>$50257 \times 128 = \sim 6,000,000$</p>

<p>$128 \times 768 = \sim 100,000$</p>

<p>The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on $128$ as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="layer-wise-parameter-sharing">
Layer-wise parameter sharing</h3>

<hr>

<p>In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>

<p>ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this:</p>

        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By only defining one transformer block and looping around it <code>n_layers</code> times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers.</p>

<p>Since we normally use $32$ bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about $6$GB of the GPU’s memory — that’s a pretty big chunk of the $16$GB of memory that’s on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model’s activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about $37$M parameters, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around $148$MB of GPU memory.</p>

<p>The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a machine learning framework like JAX, which by default unrolls and inlines loops when it’s compiling your code with XLA, the size of the unrolled and inlined loop would make the computation graph really large and take a long time to compile. This is why you’re recommended to use somehting like <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html"><code>lax.scan()</code></a> in these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sentence-order-prediction-auxillary-loss">
Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn’t use this for my custom model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="removing-dropout">
Removing dropout</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>That’s pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations.</p>

<p>There’s no way …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                                <p>If you are in search of a great rollerball you have a lot of work ahead of you. There are many brands of rollerball pens and many styles of rollerball inks, as well as many sizes and colors.</p>
<p>We’ve done the testing and done the research to fine the best rollerball pens and rollerball refills available today.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Rollerball_Pen">What Is A Rollerball Pen?</span></h2>
<p>As we noted in our <a href="https://unsharpen.com/ballpoint-vs-rollerball/">rollerball vs. ballpoint guide</a>, a rollerball is a pen that uses water-based ink where a ballpoint pen uses oil-based ink. Rollerballs use smaller writing tips — usually 0.5 mm or 0.7 mm — because their ink spreads out on the paper and forms lines that are wider than the tip of the pen. Most rollerballs use dye for color but some are pigments so they are water-resistant and semi-permanent.</p>
<p>Japanese pen maker Ohto is created with developing the first rollerball, then known as the “water-based ballpoint ink pen” in 1964.</p>

<p>In order to create this guide in a repeatable, methodical manner, we purchased a large number of rollerball pens and refills and use each across a number of different paper types. The favorite pens and refills were isolated and then used further, both for testing and real-world writing. The below rollerball pens — our top picks — are the ones we considered to be the finest rollerballs sold today.</p>
<p>Please note, that while the initial testing list included many rollerball pens, the list was not exhaustive and where are always pens and refills that will be missing in any test like this. Please contact us if you see anything notable missing.</p>
<p>Where possible all sizes of a rollerball were tested and both blue and black were testing. When options were limited the focus was on blue and 1.0 mm, which is where a rollerball can really differentiate itself from the competition.</p>
<p>Please note that gel pens were not part of this test. Gel pens have become their own category and will receive their own buying guide! <a href="https://unsharpen.com/rollerball-pen-fountain-pen-ink/">Refillable rollerball pens</a> are eligible for this list.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Mainstream_Rollerball_Pens">Best Mainstream Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you find yourself walking through the aisles of an office superstore and you want a great rollerball, what should you get? Or if you want a 12-pack of excellent, not-too-expensive rollerballs, what’s the best pick? These are the pens in this list.</p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Vision_Elite">Uni-ball Vision Elite</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-vision-elite/">Uni-ball Vision Elite</a>&nbsp;has lone been a top pick among choosy rollerball fans as well as dedicated fountain pen users who want something for day-to-day writing. This pen is smooth, a bit watery in its ink, and uses Uni-ball’s Super Ink, which is chemical-, water-, and fade-resistant, plus is acid-free and of archival quality.</p>
<p>This pen is affordable, easy to find, quite smooth, and is reliable. The downsides are that its design is somewhat dated at this point, and it’s not really refillable <a href="https://amzn.to/3hrqYhu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">(the refills are almost full pens themselves</a>). This is the essence of a great everyday rollerball.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="51" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-450x51.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-1024x117.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite-768x87.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Uni-ball_Vision_Elite.jpg 1476w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Air">Uni-ball Air</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-air/">Uni-ball Air</a>&nbsp;is a unique, high-tech take of the everyday rollerball. It also uses Uni-ball’s everything-resistant Super Ink and it’s similarly not refillable, but it has Uni’s “Cushion Tip” writing end which is smooth and forgiving, making the pen a great choice for almost all writing scenarios.</p>
<p>The pen isn’t refillable and has an entirely plastic body (including the clip), but it’s still a great everyday rollerball because it’s fun to use, easy to find, and a great writer overall.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Rollerball_Pens">Best Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a great rollerball pen and are willing to upgrade past a disposable pen, here are the top picks of 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="44" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-768x75.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Tombow_Zoom_505">Tombow Zoom 505</span></h3>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 combines an affordable metal body with a pigmented refill that is permanent and surprisingly fun to use, even though Tombow is not typically known for their rollerballs. The build quality of this pen’s body is excellent for the price which is surprising right around $20.</p>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 also benefits from being sold as a set of instruments. So if you like the rollerball, you can also buy the 505 in a mechanical pencil and a fountain pen. The downsides of this rollerball are that it has a proprietary refill, the older models of which tend to leak, but it’s still a great writer.</p>
<h3><span id="Lamy_Vista">Lamy Vista</span></h3>
<p>The Lamy Vista (the clear version of the Lamy Safari) uses Lamy’s <a href="https://unsharpen.com/refill/lamy-m63/">M63 rollerball refill</a>. This means the pen is a combination of a good rollerball refill and a great pen body. The good news is that the refill is easy to swap out if you want to use a standard European rollerball refill, like a Waterman or even a Pilot G2 gel refill. This is just an all-round great pen that is ideal for everyday use and will last you for years of writing.l</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="226" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-768x386.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Pilot_Hi-Tecpoint_V7">Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pilot-precise-and-hi-tecpoint-pen-guide/">Hi-Tecpoint V7</a> is a refillable rollerball pen that uses fountain pen-like cartridges and a liquid rollerball ink. The pen is great looking, with a flat paint job, and handsome aesthetics. The pen is like a better version of the Pilot Precise V7 — which is much more common in the US — because the Hi-Tecpoint looks better and is refillable using a cartridge.</p>
<p>Then pen is also sold in a very wet 1.0 mm and a smooth but precise 0.5 mm version, called the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-v10-grip-hi-tecpoint/">V10</a> and V5 respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png" alt="" width="450" height="46" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Stabilo_Worker">Stabilo Worker+</span></h3>
<p>While it’s not as popular as the rest of the pens on this list, the Stabilo Worker+ is an excellent roller, as is its refillable counterpart, the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/stabilo-bionic/">Bionic</a>. These pens have confusing conventions, where the 0.5 mm Medium version writes more like a 1.0 mm, but they are both exceptionally smooth and comfortable pens.</p>
<p>The Worker+ is known for its bold orange body and comfortable rubber coating, but then pen is also available in black, grey, and now other colors if you want something more muted.</p>
<p>This is super smooth rollerball that deserves more attention.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A DC woman said an FBI agent contacted her and said investigators were reaching out to the owner of every phone that touched a cell tower near the riot.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — If you were anywhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, you may be getting a knock on your door from the FBI.</p>
                    <p>A D.C. woman said an agent visited her neighbor and called her, telling them investigators were tracking people whose cell phones connected to wi-fi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                        
                    <p>"They don't call first, they just come to your house," Bree Stevens, a legal investigator who lives near Capitol Hill, said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said an FBI agent told her they were reaching out to every single person whose cell phone put them near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                    <p>She was out for a walk with a friend and his two young daughters on the afternoon of Jan. 6, but they were diverted by bomb scares until they ended up right next to the insurrection. Adults and kids were cordoned off and unable to get back to their apartments for four hours.</p>
                    <p>"You don't want to be anywhere where they're going to go!" she said on a video she shot while police officers in riot gear quick-stepped toward the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><br>Monday night, an investigator knocked on the door of her friend's apartment, who was "in house clothes" at the time.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"His little girl had just painted his toenails, that was a little bit embarrassing," Stevens said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens was out of town, so the agent called her on the phone number that the FBI had tracked.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol," Stevens said. "And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping."&nbsp;</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><span><p>IRMA is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the Idemix attribute-based credential scheme, allowing users to safely and securely authenticate themselves as privacy-preserving as the situation permits. Users receive digitally signed attributes from trusted issuer, storing them in their IRMA app, after which the user can selectively disclose attributes to others. Schematically:</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/issuance.png" alt="issuance-flow">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclosure.png" alt="disclosure-flow">
</p>
<p>Using the issuer's digital signature over the attributes the verifier can verify that the attributes were given to the user in the past, and that they have not been modified since.</p>
<h2>IRMA session flow</h2>
<p>A typical IRMA session is depicted schematically below.</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/irmaflow.png" alt="IRMA session flow"></p>
<p>Software components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Requestor backend and frontend</em>: Generally the requestor runs a website with a (JavaScript) frontend in the user's browser, and a backend server. During an IRMA session the frontend displays the IRMA QR that the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> scans. All frontend tasks depicted in the diagram are supported by <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>: Handles IRMA protocol with the IRMA app for the requestor.</li>
<li><a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app"><em>IRMA mobile app</em></a>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/irma-authentication/id1294092994">iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually the session starts by the user performing some action on the website (e.g. clicking on "Log in with IRMA").</li>
<li>The requestor sends its <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests">session request</a> (containing the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed) to the <a href="#irma-servers">IRMA server</a>. Depending on its configuration, the IRMA server accepts the session request only if the session request is authentic (e.g. a validly signed <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests#jwts-signed-session-requests">session request JWT</a>) from an authorized requestor.</li>
<li>The IRMA server accepts the request and assigns a session token (a random string) to it. It returns the contents of the QR code that the frontend must display: the URL to itself and the session token.</li>
<li>The frontend (<a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>) receives and displays the QR code, which is scanned by the IRMA app.</li>
<li>The IRMA app requests the session request from step 1, receiving the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed.</li>
<li>The IRMA server returns the session request.</li>
<li>The IRMA app displays the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed, and asks the user if she wants to proceed.</li>
<li>The user accepts.</li>
<li>The IRMA server performs the IRMA protocol with the IRMA app, issuing new attributes to the user, or receiving and verifying attributes from the user's IRMA app, or receiving and verifying an attribute-based signature made by the user's app.</li>
<li>The session status (<code>DONE</code>, <code>CANCELLED</code>, <code>TIMEOUT</code>), along with disclosed and verified attributes or signature depending on the session type, are returned to the requestor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these tasks are performed by the requestor's backend and which by its frontend differs case by case:
<ul>
<li>Often the session request is sent to the IRMA server by the requestor's backend, after which the IRMA server's reply in step 2 is forwarded to the frontend which renders it as a QR code. Step 1 can however also be done by <code>irma-frontend</code>, in which case <code>irma-frontend</code> automatically picks up the IRMA server's reply in step 2 and renders the QR code.</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>irma-frontend</code> can be instructed to fetch the session result in step 10, but this can also be done in the backend. In the latter, <code>irma-frontend</code> can fetch a custom result at your backend, if desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The IRMA server could be deployed on the same machine as the requestor's backend, but it need not be; possibly it is not even controlled by the requestor. Generally, steps 2/3 and 10 are done with REST HTTP calls to the IRMA server, but in case the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-lib"><code>irmaserver</code></a> library is used, these steps are function calls. Alternatively, you could use one of the packages in <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-backend"><code>irma-backend-packages</code></a> to do these steps with function calls in other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session types</h2>
<p>In an IRMA session, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA mobile app</a> performs one of the following three <em>session types</em> with an <a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disclosure sessions</em>: Upon receiving a list of requested attributes from the IRMA server, the app discloses the required attributes to the IRMA server if the app user agrees, after which they are verified by the IRMA server.</li>
<li><em>Attribute-based signature sessions</em>: Similar to disclosure sessions, but the attributes are attached to a message digitally signed into an <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#attribute-based-signatures"><em>attribute-based signature</em></a>. The attribute-based signature can be verified at any later time, ensuring that the signed message is intact, and that the IRMA attributes attached to it were valid at the time of creation of the attribute-based signature.</li>
<li><em>Issuance sessions</em>: the IRMA app receives a new set of IRMA attributes including valid issuer signatures from the IRMA server, to use in later disclosure or attribute-based signature sessions. (Possibly the user is asked to disclose some attributes as well, within the same IRMA session, before receiving the new attributes. This is called a <em>combined issuance-disclosure session</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is depicted schematically and explained in more detail in the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma#irma-session-flow">IRMA session flow</a> chapter. For the user, after scanning the QR in his/her IRMA app a disclosure session generally looks like the following. (Attribute-based signature sessions and issuance sessions are identical in terms of their flow (scan qr, provide permission, success screen); only the graphical interface is different.)</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-permission.png" alt="disclose-permission">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-done.png" alt="disclosure-done">
</p>
<h2>IRMA servers</h2>
<p>Various existing software components documented on this website can perform the role of the IRMA server.
Apart from exposing an API that is used by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> during IRMA sessions, each of these components also offer an API with which IRMA sessions can be started and monitored, for use by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#participants"><em>requestor</em></a>: the party wishing to issue attributes to or verify attributes from an IRMA app. The IRMA server handles the IRMA session with the IRMA app for the requestor.</p>
<p>Currently the following IRMA servers exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>irma server</code> command of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-cli"><code>irma</code></a> binary: a standalone daemon exposing its requestor API as HTTP endpoints. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>irmaserver</code> Go library, exposing a HTTP server that handles IRMA sessions with the IRMA app, and Go functions for starting and managing IRMA sessions. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-library">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server/irmaserver">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The now deprecated <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server"><code>irma_api_server</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About this documentation</h2>
<p>IRMA uses JSON to pass messages within IRMA sessions. The majority of IRMA is <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago">written in Go</a>, and the JSON messages generally correspond to specific Go structs. For example, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-result"><code>GET /session/{token}/result</code></a> endpoint of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server"><code>irma server</code></a> outputs instances of the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#SessionResult"><code>server.SessionResult</code></a>.  In such cases, a link to the corresponding Go struct will be included. This can tell you what fields you can use or expect. (Note that some structs have custom (un)marshalers. See also the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go">Go documentation</a> on JSON and Go.)</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a previous post <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring mmap using Go</a>, we talked about how databases have a major problem to solve, which is: <strong>how to deal with data stored in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. We talked about how many databases solve this problem using <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> and explored <strong>mmap</strong> capabilities.</p><p>Knowing that databases use <strong>memory-mapped files </strong>to solve the problem was not enough for me. It solved part of the mystery but a question remained: <strong>how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em> to read and write data from disk?</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I decided to dig through a database source code to answer that question. There are plenty of databases that use mmap. Some of them decided to not use anymore. Some examples: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> has an option of accessing disk content directly using memory-mapped I/O<sup>[1]</sup>, it seems <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> used to use but it changed it<sup>[2]</sup>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> has an option with <em>MMapDirectory</em><sup>[3]</sup>, <a href="https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/">LMDB</a> uses mmap<sup>[4]</sup>, a simple key/value in-memory database from Counchbase called <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/moss">moss</a> uses mmap for durability of in-memory data<sup>[5]</sup> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> removed <strong>mmap</strong> storage engine for <em>WiredTiger</em><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">bolt</a>, a simple <strong>key/value store</strong> implemented in <strong>Go</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> inspired by the <strong>LMDB</strong> project, for this endeavor. Mostly because of source code simplicity and my familiarity with Go language. I know a simple key/value store might not be the most complete source code for learning all the details of reading/writing data to disk, but as I have found out, it was more than enough to get a grasp of it. </p><p>The original bolt repository is no longer maintained. A fork of <strong>bolt</strong> called <strong>bbolt</strong> is maintained and used by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">etcd</a>. If you are not familiar with <strong>bolt</strong>, I recommend the articles <a href="https://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/">Intro to BoltDB: Painless Performant Persistence</a> and <a href="https://www.progville.com/go/bolt-embedded-db-golang/">Bolt — an embedded key/value database for Go </a>.</p><h2 id="the-start">The start</h2><p>I download the code to my machine and opened it in my editor. I thought a good place to start digging was to find out where the database was initialized and look for any references of <strong>mmap</strong> there. Like most embedded databases, <strong>bolt </strong>has an <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L150">Open</a> method for opening the database or creating a new one if it does not exist. Inside it, I found a reference to a private <strong>mmap</strong> function. That's a good start. </p><pre><code>// Memory map the data file.
if err := db.mmap(options.InitialMmapSize); err != nil {
    _ = db.close()
    return nil, err
}</code></pre><h2 id="how-much-memory-should-i-allocate">How much memory should I allocate?</h2><p>The private <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20(db%20*DB)%20mmap(minsz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a> is responsible for opening the memory-mapped file. In order to do this, it needs to figure out how much memory it is going to allocate. This task is accomplished by another method called <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a>. Given the size of the database, this method figures out how many bytes of memory should be allocated.</p><p>It starts by doubling the size from <strong>32KB</strong> to <strong>1GB</strong>. But if the database is larger than <strong>1GB</strong>, it grows <strong>1GB</strong> at a time.</p><pre><code>// Double the size from 32KB until 1GB.
for i := uint(15); i &lt;= 30; i++ {
	if size &lt;= 1&lt;&lt;i {
		return 1 &lt;&lt; i, nil
	}
}

...

// If larger than 1GB then grow by 1GB at a time.
sz := int64(size)
if remainder := sz % int64(maxMmapStep); remainder &gt; 0 {
	sz += int64(maxMmapStep) - remainder
}</code></pre><p>It is all fine by now. That's how <strong>bolt</strong> figured out how much to allocate. But there is a piece of the puzzle now that will be very important when we talk about database storage layout. After figuring out how much to allocate, it needs to ensure that the allocated size is a multiple of the <strong>page size</strong>. If you are not familiar with database storage and don't know what a <strong>page</strong> is, don't worry, we'll be back to this.</p><pre><code>// Ensure that the mmap size is a multiple of the page size.
// This should always be true since we're incrementing in MBs.
pageSize := int64(db.pageSize)
if (sz % pageSize) != 0 {
	sz = ((sz / pageSize) + 1) * pageSize
}</code></pre><p>Shouldn't it check if we are allocating more than we have available? That's the last piece of the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a> method.</p><pre><code>// If we've exceeded the max size then only grow up to the max size.
if sz &gt; maxMapSize {
	sz = maxMapSize
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bolt_amd64.go#L4">maxMapSize</a> constant is set to <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFF</code> on <strong>AMD64</strong> architectures.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><blockquote>The <strong>AMD64</strong> architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TiB (2<sup>48</sup> bytes) of virtual address space. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64 Wiki</a></blockquote><p>This is the limit of the <strong>bolt</strong> database file.</p><h2 id="calling-the-system-call">Calling the system call</h2><p>Now that <strong>bolt</strong> knows how much it should allocate, it calls the system call <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20mmap(db%20*DB,%20sz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a>. Here is the full code for <em>Unix</em>-like environments:</p><pre><code>// mmap memory maps a DB's data file.
func mmap(db *DB, sz int) error {
	// Map the data file to memory.
	b, err := syscall.Mmap(int(db.file.Fd()), 0, sz, syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED|db.MmapFlags)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Advise the kernel that the mmap is accessed randomly.
	if err := madvise(b, syscall.MADV_RANDOM); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("madvise: %s", err)
	}

	// Save the original byte slice and convert to a byte array pointer.
	db.dataref = b
	db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
	db.datasz = sz
	return nil
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It is a pretty straightforward code. I have some observations to make about <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code>, but I'll leave for the next session. It is nice to see the call to madvise there, although I don't know its benefits. I would love to know the importance of that call, if it improves performance or if another flag could be set to get different behavior from OS for different use cases.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-about-writes">What about writes?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While skimming through the source code, I looked for evidence of how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for both reads and writes. I dug both <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L266">Get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L285">Put</a> method. I could not find any place where the references to <code>db.dataref</code> or <code>db.data</code> were being updated. I discovered that the writes to disk happen when <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/tx.go#L144">Commit</a> is called to a transaction.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then, suddenly, while looking back to the call of <strong>mmap</strong>, I noticed the  <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code> flag that I have not noticed the first time I looked at the code. So <strong>mmap</strong>, is only used for reads in <strong>bolt</strong>. Another place that indicates this is in the definition of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L100">DB struct</a>:</p>

Mostly because I don't understand enough to go deep. Just going to try to give a glimpse of what is going on. </p><p>A file is just an array of bytes. We have to apply some reasoning to this array of bytes to work with it effectively.

<div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/Italianauthority">Italian authority</a> has blocked certain users from accessing TikTok. Users, who can’t definitely verify their age after the tragic death of a young girl who is taking part in a “blackout challenge”, from accessing Tiktok.</p>
<p>This girl’s death was firstly reported by ANSA on Thursday when it happened.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<p>A Italian girl,10, was pronounced brain dead by a Palermo hospital on Thursday after she took the Blackout Challenge on TikTok.</p>
<p>Her parents have accepted to donate the organs of the girl, who tied a belt round her neck to self-asphyxiate in the challenge on Tiktok.</p>
<p>Read also: <strong><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tiktok-star-tony-lopez-sued-for-sexual-battery/">TikTok Star, Tony Lopez Sued For Sexual Battery</a></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/italy-blocks-tiktok-for-certain-users-after-death-of-girl-allegedly-playing-choking-game#:~:text=Italian%20prosecutors%20have%20opened%20an,could%20not%20be%20proved%20definitively." target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>, an investigation has been opened by Italian prosecutors , and Italy has temporarily blocked users from gaining access to the popular social platform “whose age couldn’t be verified.”</p>
<p>TikTok had reported that it has not discovered any content on its site that may have persuaded the girl to participate in the challenge, but was assisting the authorities in probing the incident.</p>
<p>A Tiktok spokesperson said: “The safety of the TikTok community is our absolute priority, for this reason we do not allow any content which encourages, promotes or glorifies behavior that could be dangerous”</p>
<p>The report shows that the Italian Data Protection Authority had blocked TikTok till February 15th immediately till regulator’s demands are met. This challenge being referred to was also reportedly called “scarfing” or “the choking game”, involving participants blocking oxygen to their brain in order to get high. The girl’s parents told La Repubblica that they are not aware of the game and only aware of their daughter going on TikTok for dances, and to watch videos.</p>

<p>X2GO is one of the easiest open source remote access applications to  install on Linux, including on the Raspberry Pi 3B/4B. If the host is  LinuxMint and the client is a Raspberry PI, you can have both the  LinuxMint panel on the bottom of the client screen as well as the  Rasbian panel on the top of the screen – that way you can run both  local and remote apps at the same time in a split screen,  or even full screen  on separate client  monitors, or x2go client window spanning both monitors.</p>



<p>The x2goserver can handle multiple  simultaneous client computers with distinct usernames and their home  directories – rather like thin clients without PXE booting. X2GO is not   integrated into the loginctl multi-seat system but functions beside  that capability. Thus the multi-seat behavior of the client is handled by the x2goserver but initiated by the x2go client,&nbsp; not the&nbsp; host side that loginctl controls. The Raspberry Pi 4B is fast enough to be used as a full desktop and supports two HDMI monitors. It only needs to become an x2go client of an x2go server when it needs more computing power or to save files. Its window on the server can span both monitors, or stay on one of the monitors so that the user can run apps both locally and remotely on the server at the same time, moving the mouse to control which desktop the keyboard is connected to.</p>



<p>While there is a x2goclient for Windows computers, there is no  x2goserver for Windows computers.  Supporting multiple independent client sessions would violate a  Windows single workstation license. The Windows malware problem can be  solved by running Windows as a guest OS under VirtualBox on a Linux  host server. Then there is no need for the Windows OS to be connected to the  internet because you can use the browser on the Raspbian local client desktop  when needed.</p>



<p>If multiple  network cards on the x2goserver, the default is to  listen on all for clients. With lots of simultaneous clients, you might want to configure the server to separate server internet traffic from  client traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Installation of server on Linux Mint 19:</strong></p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo apt-get install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession
[sudo] password for (username):

... skipping output during installation process ...
 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo service x2goserver start
[sudo] password for (username): 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$
</pre>



<p>or, alternatively,</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$
asm32@M5A88-M:~$sudo systemctl start x2goserver
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p>To make it start automatically on boot:</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo update-rc.d x2goserver defaults
[sudo] password for asm32: 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p><strong>Installation of client on Raspberry Pi3 B+&nbsp; running <strong>Raspberry Pi OS</strong></strong> <strong>with Desktop:</strong></p>



<p>x2goclient is already in the Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi OS&nbsp; repository, so all that is needed is</p>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install x2goclient</pre>



<p>Once installed, there will be a new menu item under Internet category.</p>



<p>When configuring x2goclient sessions, you can use server hostnames instead of IP addresses. There can be more than one server on a LAN but hostnames must be unique.</p>



<p><strong>X2goclient as Raspberry Pi software zeroclient!</strong></p>



<div><p>A new raspberry pi is approximately 1/3 the cost of a new network attached zero client. Raspberry Pi could be configured to initiate an x2goclient session immediately, much like a hardware zero client, with the difference  that the x2go client provides the login screen instead of the server. </p><p>You will want to install the perl script, wakeonlan, so that you can wake up the desktop server from any of the Pi zero clients. I have edited my version so that the desired server MAC address is in the script instead of needed on the command line or in a separate file.</p></div>



<p>While x2goclient is trivial to install on a Raspberry Pi with a desktop environment, for a single purpose network attached zero client, it is not required to have a windows manager and desktop environment so you could use the <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> image at 432 MB (compared to the desktop version at 1128 MB).</p>



<p>Download here: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/"><strong>https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/</strong></a></p>



<p>Once you have downloaded and flashed a MicroSD card with this and done the initial configuration at first boot on the Raspberry Pi, add the following:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg</code></pre>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit</code></pre>



<div><p>To start up the xserver automatically, edit the file .bashrc to append the line “/usr/bin/startx” without the quotes.</p><p>Next edit the file .xinitrc to delete or make a comment the line “. /etc/X11/Xsession” and append a new line ” /usr/bin/x2goclient –thinclient –session=session-name” without the quotes. The second option launches a named session that you have setup already. Leave this option off if you have more than one server and the user needs to choose a session. If you have more than one user, you should not fill in the user name for the session. If you have only one server and one user (you are using this to remotely administer the server, perhaps) then you can set up automatic login so that the Raspberry Pi boots directly to a desktop of the remote server computer.</p></div>



<p><strong>Auto login with ssh rsa</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="570" src="http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1024x570.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1024x570.jpg 1024w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-300x167.jpg 300w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-768x427.jpg 768w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin-1536x854.jpg 1536w, http://www.multi-seat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/x2go-autologin.jpg 1812w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></figure>



<div><p>Assuming you already have a x2go session working with login, several things in the x2go session are needed for auto login to work. You most have a username (server end) or it will not know where to look for the authorized public key on the server end. It is preferable to check the box for “Try auto login” and leave the path entry  just above empty so that it will use the default location.  There can be multiple authorized public keys on the server – it will look for the one matching the client private key. There can also be multiple client sessions, each with a different private key. It is the client end (at possibly multiple separate workstations) that initiates the conversation with the server.</p><p><strong>Setting up private and public keys</strong></p></div>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa):

<p>Having generated these keys at the client end, they need to be installed at both ends. In my case asm32@asus-centos7 is my username on my server hostname.</p>

and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

-rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 444 Jul 12 17:55 known_hosts
pi@raspberrypi:~ $</pre>



<p>Note that after the client end command,  ssh-copy-id,  the public key has been added to the server end .ssh/authorized_keys and the client end now has a .ssh/known_hosts.</p>



<p>The right panel of x2goclient has all the sessions you have configured. When you select one of these, it will move to the blue left panel. With auto login, it will immediately start to connect to the server.  If you leave it in the left panel when you exit the session, then the next invocation of x2goclient will immediately attempt to connect to the server. In the case of a <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> installation as described above, the Pi will boot directly into connecting to its configured session on the server – similar to the Phistek ZE7000 network attached zero client at less than 1/3 the hardware cost.</p>



<p>The Phistek ZE7000 has superior video performance. Its silicon USB over IP chip is transmitting compressed USB over IP protocol, whereas the x2go method is transmitting compressed X protocol graphic primitives which is more efficient for non video applications.</p>

Why? So far as I can tell, it’s because I’ve been using Facebook to advocate for decentralization of social media. And apparently the algorithm didn’t like that.</p> <p>This morning, sometime between 8:54am and 9:06am Mountain, Facebook disabled my account. Just after 8:54am, I copy-pasted the content of my latest Twitter post into a new post on Facebook. At 9:06am, a friend received a Facebook notification indicating that he needed to update his trusted contacts because I was no longer available. Here’s the exact text and link that I posted to both Twitter and Facebook:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121">22 January 2021</a>)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks.

I was able to login. But I wasn’t able to see anything except the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Your Account Has Been Disabled. For more information please visit the Help Center. Your account was disabled on Jan 22, 2021. If you think your account was disabled by mistake you can submit more information via the Help Center for up to 30 days after your account was disabled.

It took me to the Help Center. There I found a link to request a review. Clicking on that link took me to a form which requested my full name and photo ID.</p> <p>I filled out the form, providing my name and a JPG of my government issued ID. Then I submitted the form. In response, I received the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We Cannot Review the Decision to Disable Your Account. Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-9.26.23-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="why-facebook-disabled-my-account">Why Facebook Disabled My Account</h2> <p>I don’t know for sure why Facebook disabled my account. I didn’t receive an explanation. There was no reference to particular Facebook Community Standards that I might have broken. There was no indication of how I might have been violating Facebook’s terms of service.</p> <p>Moreover, I have never received a warning from Facebook. And I didn’t receive a warning today. They provided no information beyond what I’ve quoted above.</p> <p>I’ve never used Facebook or any other social media to advocate violence, political or otherwise. And I’m a political centrist. In fact, during the political controversies of 2020, I repeatedly insisted on civility to such an extent that it frustrated some of my more partisan friends. So we can’t plausibly look for an explanation there.</p> <p>We could imagine a conspiracy among people who dislike my religious views. There’s plenty of <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2018/09/this-post-is-brought-to-you-by.html">strong anti-Mormon and anti-Transhumanist sentiment</a> out there. Perhaps, banding together, a group of people reported or otherwise flagged my content on Facebook as inappropriate. But this seems a bit paranoid to me.</p> <p>I don’t think the cause was the link that I shared, in itself. Quite a few other people have shared that link on Facebook. In fact, at this moment, their API indicates that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fdecentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">the link has received at least 88 likes, shares, and comments across Facebook</a>. And that number has been increasing throughout the day without Facebook banning others for it, to the best of my knowledge.</p> <p>So I think the cause must have been the comment itself. Or, more generally, it may have been an emerging pattern in the comments of my posts. For a long time, I have advocated replacing Facebook with <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2015/05/the-reputation-web.html">decentralized social networks</a>. And current events have motivated me to increase the frequency of that advocacy.</p> <p>Several times over the last week or two, I have promoted decentralization in posts to both Facebook and Twitter. The content and links of the original posts were identical on the two platforms. So you can see them on my Twitter account. For easy reference, here are copies of my most recent cross-posts in reverse chronological order (as ordered on Twitter and previously on Facebook):</p> <ul> <li> <p>“Congratulations to President Biden and Vice-President Harris. May your term in office be peaceful and prosperous, for the United States of America and for our world.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351953891655520258">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“The debate between capitalism and socialism is often framed as a choice between large corporations and large government. This framing is cultivated by political and economic elites. The truth is that there’s an alternative to both. Limit both. Decentralize ALL power.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351914808753307649">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“In a recent discussion with the Christian Transhumanist Association, I presented and answered questions about the New God Argument. Here’s a recording. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351384453231230976">18 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Decentralization is a practical necessity. For Christians, it’s also a theological mandate. Essential to the Gospel is a transformative discipleship, wherein we each participate in the role of Christ and become joint heirs in the glory of God. Divine creation IS decentralization.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350943723908198406">17 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“If God ensures the right spirit is associated with the right body during human-mediated procreation, why wouldn’t God ensure the same for human-mediated resurrection? If you build it, they will come. If they don’t come, you didn’t build it right. Seems straightforward to me.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350259207107317760">15 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“‘The long view is a thriving decentralized marketplace, fueled by personal empowerment and collaboration.’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348662980175564802">11 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Let’s say you have enough spare cash to buy a gun, donate to a charity, or invest in some Bitcoin. What do you do and why? What does your choice say about your vision of the future? How does your choice impinge on the creation of that future?” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348082874239524865">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That may or may not be comparatively fair. But if it constitutes an infringement on freedom of speech then we’ve given far too much power to Facebook and Twitter. Centrally controlled freedom of speech should terrify us.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1347931805370863617">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, on 13 January 2021, I shared to Facebook some thoughts in support of a tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. I can no longer quote the text from my Facebook post because it wasn’t a cross-post like the others. But it essentially affirmed Jack Dorsey’s interest in supporting decentralized social media, as he expressed in a recent tweet:</p> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>: <a href="https://t.co/51or6OuNNv">https://t.co/51or6OuNNv</a></p>— jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As you can see, almost all of my recent social media posts have been related to decentralization. Even the ones that aren’t obviously related to decentralization are still implicitly or indirectly related to decentralization. For example, decentralization is an important aspect of the <a href="https://new-god-argument.com/compassion-argument.html">Compassion Argument of the New God Argument</a>. And a theology that would include <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2019/04/how-to-raise-dead.html">human action toward resurrection</a> as an expression of God’s work is a decentralized theology.</p> <p>A machine learning algorithm would be capable of identifying accounts that publish posts with a pattern of negative sentiment toward centralized social media. The algorithm could also assign a score to the degree of negative sentiment. And Facebook could use that score to trigger automatic deactivation of accounts that surpass a relatively high score. None of this would require direct human intervention.</p> <p>Again, I don’t know for sure why Facebook deactivated my account. But based on what I know, I think the best explanation is that Facebook now implicitly hates decentralization. I suspect that one of its algorithms is checking for accounts that encourage use of alternative social networks. And it caught my account in its automated net.</p> <p>As an aside, perhaps some Facebook managers and engineers originally intended the algorithm to catch accounts that encourage use of social networks that focus on controversial politics. That seems possible. I’ve neither advocated for nor participated in those social networks. But I can see how my posts might have some syntactical commonalities with posts that advocate for those social networks.</p> <h2 id="why-facebook-doesnt-ban-everyone">Why Facebook Doesn’t Ban Everyone</h2> <p>Aren’t other people advocating for decentralized social networks without being banned? Maybe so. But the algorithm may have identified my account as a particularly useful target. Here’s why.</p> <p>Social network theory categorizes people according to how they function in networks. Some people are influencers within groups of similar persons. Some people are followers within groups. And some people are connectors between groups.</p> <p>Connectors facilitate transmission of ideas between dissimilar groups. Transmission of ideas can be good, promoting adaptability over time and creation of new value. But transmission of ideas can also be bad insofar as they undermine the coherence and survival of the group or system. All groups and systems, even the most creative, require a balance.</p> <p>As it turns out, my social connections are unusually diverse. For example, I have many politically progressive and many politically conservative connections. I have many religious, secular, and atheist connections. And these connections include many influencers in a wide variety of geographies around the world.</p> <p>I’m a connector. I …</p></div></div>

    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoin<span>$ </span>git log <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>"format:%cn"</span> <span>--merges</span> <span>--since</span><span>=</span>2020-01-01 | <span>sort</span>| <span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span>
    313 fanquake
     51 Jonas Schnelli
    727 MarcoFalke
      7 Pieter Wuille
     65 Samuel Dobson
    363 Wladimir J. van der Laan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>

<p><span title="G">G</span>lance at <em>Prime Minister</em>’s game board and player mats, and the first thing you’ll notice are all the numbers. The most important one is 330: the number of seats you need for a majority in the House of Commons. In this article, we’ll take a look at <em>Prime Minister</em>’s numerical side, with a focus on its measurement of public opinion.</p>



<p>At the heart of the game is an analog computer simulating the Victorian-era British political system. It tracks and links about 30 different political factors, including Parliament’s confidence in each player, each party’s popular support in eight key sectors of the electorate, current election projections, the number of government MPs and their “moderate” or “partisan” inclinations, projected votes on the government’s bills, the “uncertainty” factor in elections and Parliamentary votes, and Queen Victoria’s support for different players. By reducing these factors to numerical values and structuring their relationships, this analog computer decides who gets to lead each party, which party controls the government, and what bills the government can pass. Whoever does the best job of manipulating the factors controls the system and gets an edge in the game.</p>



<div><figure><a href="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="550" src="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1.png 977w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-300x169.png 300w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-768x432.png 768w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-760x428.png 760w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-518x292.png 518w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-82x46.png 82w, http://www.insidegmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PM_1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here you can see a partial snapshot of <em>Prime Minister</em>’s game board, showing the most detailed part of its analog computer: the eight key sectors of the electorate. They include a mix of geographic, social, and ideological groups: Conservatives, Farmers, the Gentry, Ireland, Liberals, the Middle Class, Scotland, and Workers. You’ll track support for each party in each sector, moving wooden markers up and down the numerical tracks. The side with the blue rosette tracks support for the Conservative Party, and the side with the orange rosette does the same for the Liberal Party. The green circles indicate each party’s starting position in the game’s standard setup. During the game, you’ll encounter icons from bills, events, and actions that tell you when to move the markers up and down a track. By moving a marker up one step, you earn one to three popularity points, depending on the sector and your current position. The popularity points that each party earns in the different sectors are added up, and the total relative point difference between the parties determines projections for the next election.</p>



<p>The eight sectors overlap so that one voter might belong to several different sectors at once. For example, a landowner in Scotland might belong to the Conservatives, Gentry, Farmer, and Scotland sectors. The Conservative Party might win his vote by appealing to his ideological identity as a Conservative, or the Liberal Party might win his vote by appealing to his geographic Scots identity. A sector’s significance in each election varies depending on the parties’ respective strategies. If both parties neglect Farmers, then Farmers will have no significance. But if the Conservative Party maxes out its popularity among Farmers while the Liberal Party earns nothing there, the Farmers sector will weigh heavily in the next election–not only because Farmers prefer the Conservative Party, but because they have been motivated to vote according to their economic interests.</p>



<p>Different sectors have different point spreads, reflecting their importance in the Victorian-era electorate. In this era, most British subjects didn’t have the right to vote, so the point spreads aren’t simply based on population distribution. They’re based on the number of voters and each sector’s overall impact on the election results, factoring in the value of campaign contributions, endorsements, and other means of influence. This is why the Gentry sector has more points than Workers, despite being a much smaller slice of the population.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, parties will reach maximum or minimum values in some sectors. These maximums and minimums affect the game’s strategy and evoke real-life political effects. No matter how strongly Scotland prefers one party over another, Scotland’s impact is limited by the number of voters in Scotland. Once the Conservative Party has maxed out its popularity in Scotland, it can gain nothing more there; it must look for additional points in other sectors while being careful not to rock the boat in Scotland. Conversely, once the Conservative Party has bottomed out in Ireland, it has nothing more to lose there and incurs no further penalty for continuing to neglect the Irish–a circumstance which may become useful. As in real life, the parties and politicians in <em>Prime Minister </em>can’t please everyone all the time. When faced with hard choices, they favor their political patrons and write off sectors that are unimportant to them. If there’s a rail disaster in Scotland, a Conservative Prime Minister (PM) will be forced to deal with it if he wants to retain his party’s support there. But if a problem surfaces in Ireland, the same PM might choose to ignore it and focus on something else, knowing that his party can’t do any worse in Ireland.</p>



<p>In addition to tracking popular support, the sectors also track the public’s mood for partisanship, which in turn can result in “partisan” MPs who support more radical bills. The game board measures public partisanship through “red points” that are printed side-by-side next to the total points for some sectors. Not every sector produces red points. For example, the Middle Class–not known for favoring radicalism–doesn’t generate any red points. At the other end of the spectrum, the ideological sectors (Conservatives and Liberals) produce only red points. Red points are always party-specific. If a sector offers red points, it offers them to one party only. By appealing to Workers, the Liberal Party can earn up to 7 red points, reflecting the support of radical Workers who favor partisan Liberal MPs. The Conservative Party can also earn popularity points in the Workers sector, but can’t earn any red points there because Workers who support the Conservative Party prefer moderate MPs.</p>



<p>Each sector has its own flavor and strategic impact. Both parties are free to pursue popularity in any sector–the Conservative Party may pursue a limited number of points in the Liberals sector, for example–but some sectors have a natural affinity or resistance to a particular party. In pursuing popular support in the different sectors, players have to think not only about the raw number of points they earn, but also the difficulty of holding particular sectors. Scotland has the fewest points, but it’s the most stable sector. Scotland’s interests aren’t directly implicated in the hot-button political issues of the day, so there are no bills that upset the Scots. The Middle Class is equally open to both parties and offers more points than Scotland, but is somewhat harder to hold owing to its more sensitive economic and moral preferences. Players also need to think about maintaining a coherent moderate or partisan strategy. The sectors for Conservatives and Liberals are the richest in points, making them tempting targets early in the game. But appealing to voters’ partisanship results in partisan MPs who favor divisive bills that could come back to haunt you. And if your government is equally split between moderate and partisan MPs, you may have a hard time getting them to agree on legislation.</p>



<p>In standard games, <em>Prime Minister</em>’s framework supports an open-ended format in which players strive to control government, win elections, and pass bills. Different politician abilities and about 200 unique cards ensure that no two games are the same. The same framework also supports specific scenarios that simulate historical problems, like home rule for Ireland or the repeal of the Corn Laws. Automated “Clockwork” politicians can readily function within the game’s system, opening the door to solitaire play.</p>



<p>Players have a wide variety of ways to interact with the game, starting with an action point system that allows you to perform a variable number of actions per turn. Depending on your current player mat and your politician’s fixed abilities, you can campaign to increase your party’s popularity in particular sectors, debate for or against bills, flatter Her Majesty to gain her favor, or influence MPs to make them more moderate or partisan. You can also draw “supporter” cards featuring influential Victorians who perform actions on your behalf. You’ll always have many things to do and not enough action cubes to spend, forcing you to prioritize your actions while anticipating future events. The PM’s response to random events and Parliament’s enactment of important bills have consequences that ripple through the system. The players and parties are in a constant tug of war. Collecting the right supporters, unleashing them at the right moment, and coordinating your actions with other players can help you achieve a breakthrough. But the game is not all about numbers. Relationships between players also factor heavily in the game, particularly in its 3- or 4-player mode. We’ll take a look at the players’ roles and relationships in the next <em>InsideGMT</em> article for <em>Prime Minister</em>.</p>

<p><span>May 12, 2014</span>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>There was an argument on Tumblr which, like so many arguments on Tumblr, was terrible. I will rephrase it just a little to make a point.
</p>
<p>Alice said something along the lines of “I hate people who frivolously diagnose themselves with autism without knowing anything about the disorder. They should stop thinking they’re ‘so speshul’ and go see a competent doctor.”
</p>
<p>Beth answered something along the lines of “I diagnosed myself with autism, but only after a lot of careful research. I don’t have the opportunity to go see a doctor. I think what you’re saying is overly strict and hurtful to many people with autism.”
</p>
<p>Alice then proceeded to tell Beth she disagreed, in that special way only Tumblr users can. I believe the word “cunt” was used.
</p>
<p>I notice two things about the exchange.
</p>
<p>First, why did Beth take the bait? Alice said she hated people who <em>frivolously</em> self-diagnosed <em>without knowing anything about the disorder</em>. Beth clearly was not such a person. Why didn’t she just say “Yes, please continue hating these hypothetical bad people who are not me”?
</p>
<p>Second, why did <em>Alice</em> take the bait? Why didn’t she just say “I think you’ll find I wasn’t talking about you?”
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>One of the cutting-edge advances in fallacy-ology has been the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-duped/" rel="nofollow">weak man</a>, a terribly-named cousin of the straw man. The straw man is a terrible argument nobody really holds, which was only invented so your side had something easy to defeat. The weak man is a terrible argument that only a few unrepresentative people hold, which was only <em>brought to prominence</em> so your side had something easy to defeat.
</p>
<p>For example, “I am a proud atheist and I don’t like religion. Think of the terrible things done by religion, like the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church. They try to disturb the funerals of heroes because they think God hates everybody. But this is horrible. Religious people can’t justify why they do things like this. That’s why I’m proud to be an atheist.”
</p>
<p>It’s not a straw man. There really is a Westboro Baptist Church, for some reason. But one still feels like the atheist is making things just a little too easy on himself.
</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is that the atheist is indirectly suggesting that Westboro Baptist Church is typical of religion? An implied falsehood?
</p>
<p>Then suppose the atheist posts on Tumblr: “I hate religious people who are rabidly certain that the world was created in seven days or that all their enemies will burn in Hell, and try to justify it through ‘faith’. You know, the sort of people who think that the Bible has all the answers and who hate anyone who tries to think for themselves.”
</p>
<p>Now there’s practically no implication that these people are typical. So that’s fine, right?
</p>
<p>On the other side of the world, a religious person is writing “I hate atheists who think morality is relative, and that this gives them the right to murder however many people stand between them and a world where no one is allowed to believe in God”.
</p>
<p>Again, not a straw man. The Soviet Union contained several million of these people. But if you’re an atheist, would you just let this pass?
</p>
<p>How about “I hate black thugs who rob people”?
</p>
<p>What are the chances a black guy reads that and says “Well, good thing I’m not a thug who robs people, he’ll probably <em>love</em> me”?
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>What is the problem with statements like this?
</p>
<p>First, they are meant to re-center a category. Remember, people think in terms of categories with central and noncentral members – a sparrow is a central bird, an ostrich a noncentral one. But if you live on the Ostrich World, which is inhabited only by ostriches, emus, and cassowaries, then probably an ostrich seems like a pretty central example of ‘bird’ and the first sparrow you see will be fantastically strange.
</p>
<p>Right now most people’s central examples of religion are probably things like your local neighborhood church. If you’re American, it’s probably a bland Protestant denomination like the Episcopalians or something.
</p>
<p>The guy whose central examples of religion are Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama is probably going to have a different perception of religion than the guy whose central examples are Torquemada and Fred Phelps. If you convert someone from the first kind of person to the second kind of person, you’ve gone most of the way to making them an atheist.
</p>
<p>More important, if you convert a culture from thinking in the first type of way to thinking in the second type of way, then religious people will be unpopular and anyone trying to make a religious argument will have to spend the first five minutes of their speech explaining how they’re not Fred Phelps, honest, and no, they don’t picket any funerals. After all that time spent apologizing and defending themselves and distancing themselves from other religious people, they’re not likely to be able to make a very rousing argument for religion.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/15/the-cowpox-of-doubt/" rel="nofollow">Cowpox of Doubt</a>, I mention the inoculation effect. When people see a terrible argument for an idea get defeated, they are more likely to doubt the idea later on, even if much better arguments show up.
</p>
<p>Put this in the context of people attacking the Westboro Baptist Church. You see the attacker win a big victory over “religion”, broadly defined. Now you are less likely to believe in religion when a much more convincing one comes along.
</p>
<p>I see the same thing in atheists’ odd fascination with creationism. Most of the religious people one encounters are not young-earth creationists. But these people have a dramatic hold on the atheist imagination.
</p>
<p>And I think: well, maybe if people see atheists defeating a terrible argument for religion enough, atheists don’t <em>have to</em> defeat any of the others. People have already been inoculated against religion. “Oh, yeah, that was the thing with the creationism. Doesn’t seem very smart.”
</p>
<p>If this is true, it means that all religious people, like it or not, are in the same boat. An atheist attacking creationism becomes a deadly threat for the average Christian, even if that Christian does not herself believe in creationism.
</p>
<p>Likewise, when a religious person attacks atheists who are moral relativists, or communists, or murderers, then all atheists have to band together to stop it somehow or they will have successfully poisoned people against atheism.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>This is starting to sound a lot like <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/329171.html" rel="nofollow">something I wrote on my old blog about superweapons</a>.
</p>
<p>I suggested imagining yourself in the shoes of a Jew in czarist Russia. The big news story is about a Jewish man who killed a Christian child. As far as you can tell the story is true. It’s just disappointing that everyone who tells it is describing it as “A Jew killed a Christian kid today”. You don’t want to make a big deal over this, because no one is saying anything objectionable like “And so all Jews are evil”. Besides you’d hate to inject identity politics into this obvious tragedy. It just sort of makes you uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>The next day you hear that the local priest is giving a sermon on how the Jews killed Christ. This statement seems historically plausible, and it’s part of the Christian religion, and no one is implying it says anything about the Jews today. You’d hate to be the guy who barges in and tries to tell the Christians what Biblical facts they can and can’t include in their sermons just because they offend you. It would make you an annoying busybody. So again you just get uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>The next day you hear people complain about the greedy Jewish bankers who are ruining the world economy. And really a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish, and bankers really do seem to be the source of a lot of economic problems. It seems kind of pedantic to interrupt every conversation with “But also some bankers are Christian, or Muslim, and even though a disproportionate number of bankers are Jewish that doesn’t mean the Jewish bankers are disproportionately active in ruining the world economy compared to their numbers.” So again you stay uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>Then the next day you hear people complain about Israeli atrocities in Palestine (what, you thought this was past czarist Russia? This is future czarist Russia, after Putin finally gets the guts to crown himself). You understand that the Israelis really do commit some terrible acts. On the other hand, when people start talking about “Jewish atrocities” and “the need to protect Gentiles from Jewish rapacity” and “laws to stop all this horrible stuff the Jews are doing”, you just feel worried, even though you personally are not doing any horrible stuff and maybe they even have good reasons for phrasing it that way.
</p>
<p>Then the next day you get in a business dispute with your neighbor. Maybe you loaned him some money and he doesn’t feel like paying you back. He tells you you’d better just give up, admit he is in the right, and apologize to him – because if the conflict escalated everyone would take his side because he is a Christian and you are a Jew. And everyone knows that Jews victimize Christians and are basically child-murdering Christ-killing economy-ruining atrocity-committing scum.
</p>
<p>You have been boxed in by a serious of individually harmless but collectively dangerous statements. None of them individually referred to you – you weren’t murdering children or killing Christ or owning a bank. But they ended up getting you in the end anyway.
</p>
<p>Depending on how likely you think this is, this kind of forces Jews together, makes them become strange bedfellows. You might not like what the Jews in Israel are doing in Palestine. But if you think someone’s trying to build a superweapon against you, and you don’t think you can differentiate yourself from the Israelis reliably, it’s in your best interest to defend them anyway.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>I wrote the superweapon post to address some of my worries about feminism, so it would not be surprising at all if we found this dynamic there.
</p>
<p>Feminists tend to talk about things like “Men tend to silence women and not respect their opinions” or “Men treat women like objects …</p></div></div>

				<p>I’ve decided to make a series of at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUkQYy-K8Y-wYcDgDXKhfs6OT8fFQtVm" target="_blank">8 free weekly-based webinars</a> about<strong> in-depth implementation details of the .NET GC</strong> and… I’m super happy with it! Why the idea? Many <strong>my other activities are about more practical “.NET memory management”</strong>, like <a href="https://prodotnetmemory.com/" target="_blank">my book</a> or <a href="https://workshop.prodotnetmemory.com/" target="_blank">workshops/trainings/consultancy</a> I gave. But during all this practical-oriented events t<strong>here is always not enough time</strong> to explain in details how .NET GC is implemented. Obviously, I always explain some concepts and algorithms, to the level that helps in understanding the whole concept. But not with the level of details that I am satisfied.</p>
<p>Hence the idea – make a separate <strong>content that will be just as deep as I like</strong> 🙂 So, I will cover details on the level of bits, bytes and source code, not only on the level of the overall algorithm description.</p>
<p>The first episode was yesterday, feel invited to watch:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i1Nv7wGsjk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p>The topics I’ve covered in the first module:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whole series roadmap</li>
<li>some fundamentals like reference counting (including more modern algorithms) and tracing GC</li>
<li>.NET GC types and its history</li>
<li>first dive into the .NET 5 runtime source code, including the first breakpoints in the famous 40 kLOC gc.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>And the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUkQYy-K8Y-wYcDgDXKhfs6OT8fFQtVm" target="_blank">playlist is also available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>The topics I will cover during the whole series are as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02.png"><img src="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-1024x535.png" alt="gcwebinar02" width="720" height="376" srcset="https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-1024x535.png 1024w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-300x157.png 300w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02-768x401.png 768w, https://tooslowexception.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/gcwebinar02.png 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>And we will see whethere it ends after eight episodes, or maybe a new interesting topics will emerge (including, from your questions).</p>
<p>Have a nice watch!</p>

Since I’m a huge fan myself, I'm doing a Game Design Perspective on the game to celebrate. I'll be looking at the game mechanics and how the interlocking layers make the game tick.</p><p>In Stardew Valley, you play as a disillusioned city slicker who takes over their grandfather's broken-down farm. You clear the land so you can grow crops, a la Harvest Moon. Beyond the basics of farming, the game really shines in its variety. You can go fishing on the beach, delve into a dangerous cave in the mountains, raise livestock, interact with a town full of characters, cook up different dishes, donate buried treasure to the museum, and participate in a number of holiday festivals throughout the year. Juliana's put in maybe forty hours over the past couple weeks, which is about half the time I put in when I played. Clearly, the game has something that makes you want to come back. Let's take a look why.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_66246"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_69860"><div><p>One of the things Stardew Valley does best is variety, both in the small and in the large. Farming is the most fundamental activity in the game and it's a great example of variety "in the small". You have 44 different crops in the game (not counting fruit trees or mushrooms). Each crop has distinct and visually-appealing pixel artwork that shows the growing plant and the final product. Time passes through the four seasons, and each season has its own soundtrack, background weather effects (snowy forests or flower petals swaying in the breeze), and set of crops. As soon as the player gets used to, say, planting parsnips in the spring, summer arrives and a whole new set of crops becomes available. The player isn't able to keep going in the same routine. That's good for keeping engagement up.</p><p>More so than the sheer quantity of crops (or fish or buried treasure or...), Stardew shines in the number of activities available to you. This is the variety "in the large". There are five major skill tracks - farming, fishing, foraging, fighting, and fmining. Each one has an experience tracker and perks for being more experienced. All tracks except foraging have associated and upgradable equipment.</p><p>A day could be spent gathering wood or stone to upgrade your farm or trying to catch a rare fish in the mountain lake. It could be spent a day going deeper in the monster-infested mines or running errands for the townsfolk. You can forage for wild flowers near the river or decorate your farm. You can skip out on all your responsibilities and do nothing but play video games - just like real life! There's never enough time in a single Stardew day to do everything you want to do. That's a great way to keep players coming back - it gives that "just one more turn" feeling that leads people to play Civilization until dawn.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_70445"><div>

Stardew keeps on chugging by having these different activities overlap with each other and support each other. Performing one activity will provide progress towards another or even unlock new goals for the player. A player could spend the day fishing, perhaps trying to catch the elusive lingcod. They might bring up some sunken treasure chests containing artifacts to donate to the museum. The player will likely catch a few common fish while going after the lingcod - these common fish could be turned into fertilizer to grow better crops. If the player is delving into the mines, they will find the stone to help build a barn. If a player is making friends with the townsfolk, they'll get new crafting recipes to increase their farm's production. Almost every activity in the game will help out another. This keeps the flow of the game smooth, as finishing one activity primes the player for the next one.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_74818"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_78634"><div><p>I find it useful to think about games in terms of nested reward cycles. A game designer needs to think about feedback, goals, and rewards happening both in repeating cycles and hierarchical layers. What should the player do in the next fifteen seconds? The next five minutes? The next thirty? Mario can provide a quick example - the player can jump on a goomba (pleasant sound effects!), finish a level (look at that flag go!), and rescue the princess (take that, Bowser!).&nbsp; A short-term cycle will happen many times during a medium-term cycle, which in turn repeats itself during the long-term cycles. In Stardew, chopping down a tree nets you wood, which you can use to build yourself a new chicken coop, which you can use to hatch a flock of egg-laying chickens, which you can use to get a mayonnaise factory going, and so on and so forth.</p><p>Stardew adds an effective twist to this idea by delaying rewards. When you first plant a parsnip seed, you won't get to harvest it until a week later. You'll have to spend time each day watering the little guy, and that anticipation makes the eventual pay-off that much sweeter. It uses the delay to good effect in other areas. For instance, when you upgrade your equipment with the town blacksmith, the upgrade doesn't happen instantly. It easily could have happened this way if the game designer wanted it to. Instead, the blacksmith keeps your tool (watering can, pickax, etc.) for a couple of days. If you don't have, say, your pickaxe, then you can't delve into the mines. This forces you to explore other aspects of the game by constraining your available options. Sometimes the game incentivizes different activities with the carrot, and sometimes it uses the stick.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_79170"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_83009"><div><p>One of my favorite bits of game design in Stardew are the Bundles. In the community center, you can help the spirits of the forest restore the community by leaving various items as offerings. These offerings are grouped together as a "bundle", and each room in the community center has a set of bundles to complete. You get smaller rewards for finishing individual bundles, like a new scarecrow or a new mayonnaise press. You get larger rewards for finishing off a room's worth of bundles, like a greenhouse that can grow crops in the winter. The Bundles provide the player with a sense of direction in a game that otherwise has few explicit long-term goals. It organizes and focuses the time spent in the game. In fact, I consider the game "beaten" once all the Bundles have been completed.</p><p>As nice as the big "Room" rewards are, the individual "bundle" rewards are worth taking a look at. In true Stardew fashion, there are a whole boatload of different craftable items. The craftables will have different effects on your farm. For example, a mayonnaise press can turn eggs into more valuable mayo, a scarecrow will prevent wild crows from eating your crops, and a beehive will produce honey if it is nearby a flower crop. If you're developing a game and you design an item, the player may or may not end up using it. They might think it won't fit their playstyle or they might not know it's even an option. Stardew gets around this issue by just giving these craftable items to the player, which encourages the player to experiment with it. If the player likes it, they will aim to craft more. If not, the player didn’t have to spend their own resources building the thing.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1588531737133_83636"><div>

At one point, he mentioned that he wished there was a way to hire someone to milk his cows and goats and didn't have to spend time with them each morning. (Note: Update 1.3 introduced this exact item.) I found his comment hilarious. The game's ostensible narrative is that you quit your soulless job at a MegaCorporation in order to get closer to the land, but after just two years on the farm you want to hire someone to work the land for you. You've become the corporation that you tried to escape from. I waffle back and forth on whether Stardew is pro- or anti-capitalism, but in the meantime I'll be planting some parsnips.<br></p><p><em>Addendum: I’ve recently created a short Stardew-like game as part of something called the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge. It was tons of fun, although the short development time meant that I wasn’t able to hit 100% of the cool Stardew things I mentioned above.

On the one hand I really want to push myself. I’m ambitious, I want to leave it all out on the field—some of my peak work moments have come from times when I’ve pushed myself to a place where I didn’t think I could go. We all have more ability to adapt to stress and pressure than we think we do.</p><p>On the other hand, I want to be kind to myself. I wonder how much the drive to push myself is really just a drive to make up for something that I feel is missing or inadequate—and whether pushing myself will actually fill the hole. I also sometimes wonder whether letting myself off the hook is just laziness masquerading as self-care. It’s hard to tell.</p><p>But importantly, I wonder whether pushing myself might, in fact, kill me. Constant pressure creates chronic stress, and there’s all sorts of scientific studies that show that chronic stress is really bad for you. It makes you more susceptible to heart disease, it makes it harder to recover from illnesses, it can affect your sleep, and it can even affect your working memory.</p><p>There’s also all sorts of literature (and conversations on Twitter) that says that stress is actually good for you.&nbsp;</p><p>What gives? How much stress is good, and how much is bad?&nbsp;</p><p>I think that in order to understand the question we posed at the top—how much we should be pushing ourselves—we have to better understand stress. We need to understand what the stress of pushing ourselves does to our bodies, how much we can take of it, and how we can, hopefully, learn to cope with it better.</p><p>That’s what <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805073690">Why Zebra's Don't Get Ulcers</a> by Robert M. Sapolsky is about. Robert's a stress researcher, and as far as I can tell he's one of the good ones. He's the kind of intellectual who's smart, but also smart enough to know what he doesn't know. He's written a book, but he doesn't come across as trying to sell it to you—he's kind of like your zany self-aware smart-as-hell uncle who happens to study the stress responses of baboons for a living.</p><p>In the book Dr. Sapolsky harnesses his own research, as well as a wide array of animal and human studies to figure out the answer to a fairly simple question: how does stress work, and why do humans get stress-related diseases?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an interesting question—you can understand why a human body might react poorly to not being fed enough. But why would psychological stress have dangerous consequences? The basic gist is this:&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response is built to get us out of danger. If you're an animal in the Serengeti and you're being chased by a lion you really, really want to have a stress response. Being stressed means you’re preparing your muscles to move—a lot. Your heart rate rises and pushes blood to your extremities. Glucose is released into your bloodstream to help run your muscles as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The stress response pushes certain parts of your body into high gear—but it also turns certain parts of your body off. For example, when you’re stressed digestion is inhibited. What’s the point of wasting energy on digesting food for later when you might not even survive for 10 more minutes? Reproduction is also inhibited. Same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all well and good in the wild—you don't need to reproduce if a lion is eating your face off. But humans, and some more intelligent animals, have evolved the stress response from an unqualified Good Thing into...well, something that might kill you.</p><p>What’s different about our stress response? Well, we have the ability to <em>anticipate</em> danger. Other animals have this ability too: it’s a good thing to get stressed seeing the lion all the way across the savannah, instead of only when it mauls your intestines out. But humans have evolved this anticipation ability to extend far beyond other animals. We anticipate bad things months, years, or even decades out. And when we do this, the very same stress response gets turned on—even though there is no immediate danger, and there is no immediate way to avoid it.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, you aren’t just activating the stress response for a few minutes when you’re running for your life. Instead, it’s activated all the time—chronically. And this is where the problems start.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember we mentioned earlier that the stress response amps some parts of your body into high gear, and turns off others? If you’re doing that chronically, you start to have problems. Suddenly, your digestive system isn’t just inhibited for a few minutes while you’re escaping danger. It’s chronically inhibited. The same thing happens with your immune system—chronic stress tamps it down, and makes it harder for you to fight off diseases. Stress is bad for your heart too—if you’re pumping blood as if you need to run from something all the time, you’re going to get high blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, according to Sapolsky, “the stress response can become more dangerous than the stressor itself, especially when the stress is purely psychological.”</p><p>To be clear, stress doesn’t actually make you sick. But it does leave you more vulnerable to disease and illnesses than you otherwise would be—and those <em>can</em> make you very sick.</p><h3><strong>So is stress bad?</strong></h3><p>Stress isn’t good or bad. It’s a tool. In small doses it’s good, but too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing pretty quickly.</p><p>When your stress response is working properly it makes you run faster, your memory gets better, you’re able to focus better. But when your stress response is over-activated, or chronically activated—you get ulcers and heart disease. It’s bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A good analogy is exercise. Too little exercise and you open yourself up to a whole host of diseases, both physical and psychological. Too much, and you can actually kill yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What do we do about it?</strong></h3><p>The answer to the question we posed at the top, then, is that it’s great to push yourself—but you should be paying attention to the signs that tell you that you need a break. And it’s to give yourself plenty of ways to manage stress while you’re going through it, so that it doesn’t affect you as badly as it could.</p><p>This is the really interesting nugget: stress isn’t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies. Which means if you want to live a life where you’re pushing yourself, it’s best to develop a variety of coping strategies to help you manage it.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what Sapolsky recommends:</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of control</strong>.&nbsp;</h4><p>If you put a human in a room where loud noises are going off, you’ll activate their stress response. If you give the human a button to reduce the volume of the loud noises they’ll be less stressed—regardless of whether they even use the button.&nbsp;</p><p>What that means is, just knowing you have the <em>option</em> to reduce stress is enough to make something less stressful—even if you’re not actually controlling the stressors at all.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s why the first few sessions of therapy are often so powerful for patients. You’ve finally found a way to manage how you’re feeling, even though you probably haven’t changed too much about your life.</p><p>When you’re facing mild to moderate stressors, ask yourself, <em>How can I increase my sense of control in this situation?</em> You might find there are simple answers that will make you feel a lot better.</p><h4><strong>Increase your sense of predictability.</strong></h4><p>Rats that are exposed to repeated electric shocks are more likely to get ulcers. But if you ring a bell before you administer the shock—making the shock more predictable—the rats are less likely to get ulcers. If you make the stressor predictable, you only have to get stressed right before it happens. That means you’re not stressed the rest of the time, and therefore the stress response doesn’t wreak as much havoc on your body.</p><p>Making the stressors in your life more predictable can have a similar effect. When you see CEOs that keep their calendars clear and never do phone calls—you’re seeing the benefit of predictability in action.</p><p>Of course, we can’t make our lives totally predictable (and in fact that wouldn’t be desirable.) But the more you can expose yourself to stressors in a predictable way the better off you’ll be. For example, maybe only doomscroll on Twitter once a week. Or only check email a couple of times a day.</p><h4><strong>Create outlets for frustration.</strong></h4><p>When rats that are exposed to repeated stressors are given a piece of wood to gnaw on, they are far less likely to develop ulcers. Outlets for frustration are another important coping mechanism for stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many unproductive outlets—for example, taking things out on your partner or a co-worker. But there are also many productive ones, like exercise or journaling. Making a list of outlets and making sure to return to them again and again can reduce the havoc that chronic stress can wreak on your body.</p><h4><strong>Increase social support.</strong></h4><p>Social support is the last coping strategy on the list, and it’s perhaps my favorite one.</p><p>If you give a primate a stressor in the lab, you’ll find elevated markers of stress in its behavior and in its blood. But give the primate a stressor when it’s surrounded by friends—its stress markers will be lower, even for the same level of stressor.</p><p>The same thing happens in humans. For example, in one study parents of children who have been killed in war were no more likely to get disease or die—except if they were already widowed or divorced.</p><p>Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.</p><h2><strong>What did you think of this article?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Amazing">Amazing</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Good">Good</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Meh">Meh</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqlgyA7pSRFgxvzNkEFFqsPIvmkxtZ81IiGD0LQzYFL5-AA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1276325438=Bad">Bad</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>22 Jan 2021</p></header><p>Less than a month ago, I began <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html">investigating the Apple M1 GPU</a> in hopes of developing a free and open-source driver. This week, I’ve reached a second milestone: drawing a triangle with my own open-source code. The vertex and fragment shaders are handwritten in machine code, and I interface with the hardware via the IOKit kernel driver in an identical fashion to the system’s Metal userspace driver.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://rosenzweig.io/M1HelloTriangle.png" alt=""><figcaption>A triangle rendered on the M1 with open-source code</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The bulk of the new code is responsible for constructing the various command buffers and descriptors resident in shared memory, used to control the GPU’s behaviour. Any state accessible from Metal corresponds to bits in these buffers, so understanding them will be the next major task. So far, I have focused less on the content and more on the connections between them. In particular, the structures contain pointers to one another, sometimes nested multiple layers deep. The bring-up process for the project’s triangle provides a bird’s eye view of how all these disparate pieces in memory fit together.</p>
<p>As an example, the application-provided vertex data are in their own buffers. An internal table in yet another buffer points each of these vertex buffers. That internal table is passed directly as input to the vertex shader, specified in another buffer. That description of the vertex shader, including the address of the code in executable memory, is pointed to by another buffer, itself referenced from the main command buffer, which is referenced by a handle in the IOKit call to submit a command buffer. Whew!</p>
<p>In other words, the demo code is not yet intended to demonstrate an understanding of the fine-grained details of the command buffers, but rather to demonstrate there is “nothing missing”. Since GPU virtual addresses change from run to run, the demo validates that all of the pointers required are identified and can be relocated freely in memory using our own (trivial) allocator. As there is a bit of “magic” around memory and command buffer allocation on macOS, having this code working at an early stage gives peace of mind going forward.</p>
<p>I employed a piecemeal bring-up process. Since my IOKit wrapper exists in the same address space as the Metal application, the wrapper may modify command buffers just before submission to the GPU. As an early “hello world”, I identified the encoding of the render target’s clear colour in memory, and demonstrated that I could modify the colour as I pleased. Similarly, while learning about the instruction set to bring up the disassembler, I replaced shaders with handwritten equivalents and confirmed I could execute code on the GPU, provided I wrote out the machine code. But it’s not necessary to stop at these “leaf nodes” of the system; after modifying the shader code, I tried uploading shader code to a different part of the executable buffer while modifying the command buffer’s pointer to the code to compensate. After that, I could try uploading the commands for the shader myself. Iterating in this fashion, I could build up every structure needed while testing each in isolation.</p>
<p>Despite curveballs, this procedure worked out far better than the alternative of jumping straight to constructing buffers, perhaps via a “replay”. I had used that alternate technique to bring-up Mali a few years back, but it comes with the substantial drawback of fiendishly difficult debugging. If there is a single typo in five hundred lines of magic numbers, there would be no feedback, except an error from the GPU. However, by working one bit at a time, errors could be pinpointed and fixed immediately, providing a faster turn around time and a more pleasant bring-up experience.</p>
<p>But curveballs there were! My momentary elation at modifying the clear colours disappeared when I attempted to allocate a buffer for the colours. Despite encoding the same bits as before, the GPU would fail to clear correctly. Wondering if there was something wrong with the way I modified the pointer, I tried placing the colour in an unused part of memory that was already created by the Metal driver – that worked. The contents were the same, the way I modified the pointers was the same, but somehow the GPU didn’t like my memory allocation. I wondered if there was something wrong with the way I allocated memory, but the arguments I used to invoke the memory allocation IOKit call were bit-identical to those used by Metal, as confirmed by <code>wrap</code>. My last-ditch effort was checking if GPU memory had to be mapped explicitly via some side channel, like the <code>mmap</code> system call. IOKit does feature a device-independent memory map call, but no amount of fortified tracing found any evidence of side-channel system call mappings.</p>
<p>Trouble was brewing. Feeling delirious after so much time chasing an “impossible” bug, I wondered if there wasn’t something “magic” in the system call… but rather in the GPU memory itself. It was a silly theory since it produces a serious chicken-and-egg problem if true: if a GPU allocation has to be blessed by another GPU allocation, who blesses the first allocation?</p>
<p>But feeling silly and perhaps desperate, I pressed forward to test the theory by inserting a memory allocation call <em>in the middle</em> of the application flow, such that every subsequent allocation would be at a different address. Dumping GPU memory before and after this change and checking for differences revealed my first horror: an auxiliary buffer in GPU memory tracked all of the required allocations. In particular, I noticed values in this buffer increasing by one at a predictable offset (every <code>0x40</code> bytes), suggesting that the buffer contained an array of handles to allocations. Indeed, these values corresponded exactly to handles returned from the kernel on GPU memory allocation calls.</p>
<p>Putting aside the obvious problems with this theory, I tested it anyway, modifying this table to include an extra entry at the end with the handle of my new allocation, and modifying the header data structure to bump the number of entries by one. Still no dice. Discouraging as it was, that did not sink the theory entirely. In fact, I noticed something peculiar about the entries: contrary to what I thought, not <em>all</em> of them corresponded to valid handles. No, all but the <em>last</em> entry were valid. The handles from the kernel are 1-indexed, yet in each memory dump, the final handle was always <code>0</code>, nonexistent. Perhaps this acts as a sentinel value, analogous to NULL-terminated strings in C. That explanation begs the question of why? If the header already contains a count of entries, a sentinel value is redundant.</p>
<p>I pressed on. Instead of adding on an extra entry with my handle, I copied the last entry <code>n</code> to the extra entry <code>n + 1</code> and overwrote the (now second to last) entry <code>n</code> with the new handle.</p>
<p>Suddenly my clear colour showed up.</p>
<p>Is the mystery solved? I got the code working, so in some sense, the answer must be yes. But this is hardly a satisfying explanation; at every step, the unlikely solution only raises more questions. The chicken-and-egg problem is the easiest to resolve: this mapping table, along with the root command buffer, is allocated via a special IOKit selector independent from the general buffer allocation, and the handle to the mapping table is passed along with the submit command buffer selector. Further, the idea of passing required handles with command buffer submission is not unheard of; a similar mechanism is used on mainline Linux drivers. Nevertheless, the rationale for using 64-byte table entries in shared memory, as opposed to a simple CPU-side array, remains totally elusive.</p>
<p>Putting memory allocation woes behind me, the road ahead was not without bumps (and potholes), but with patience, I iterated until I had constructed the entirety of GPU memory myself in parallel to Metal, relying on the proprietary userspace only to initialize the device. Finally, all that remained was a leap of faith to kick off the IOKit handshake myself, and I had my first triangle.</p>
<p>These changes amount to around 1700 lines of code since the last blog post, available on <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/gpu">GitHub</a>. I’ve pieced together a simple demo animating a triangle with the GPU on-screen. The window system integration is effectively nonexistent at this point: XQuartz is required and detiling the (64x64 Morton-order interleaved) framebuffer occurs in software with naive scalar code. Nevertheless, the M1’s CPU is more than fast enough to cope.</p>
<p>Now that each part of the userspace driver is bootstrapped, going forward we can iterate on the instruction set and the command buffers in isolation. We can tease apart the little details and bit-by-bit transform the code from hundreds of inexplicable magic constants to a real driver. Onwards!</p>

<p>So every so often the strange economics of open-source software hits me.</p>
<p><span id="more-2749"></span><br>
Today it is almost taken for granted that the source code for most software is freely available. This is a profound and remarkable change, given how different it was only 15 years ago. From a certain point of view our industry is “giving away” its product, and yet the industry <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/opinion/is-big-tech-too-powerful-ask-google.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is richer and more powerful than ever</a>.&nbsp; So where is the value? What are the implications?</p>
<h2>Where has all the closed-source software gone?</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s not <strong>gone</strong>. It’s there at the banks, within embedded devices, and companies such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle</a> remain among the most powerful companies in the world, but almost all the innovation — and most importantly most of the excitement —&nbsp; is happening within open-source.</p>
<p>Within our industry it is becoming apparent that services — <a href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>&nbsp; and companies such as <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airbnb </a>— are the future.&nbsp; And in fact, it sometimes seems to be that the only way to write really valuable closed-source software nowadays is within the context of a service. Behind all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a> endpoints, the&nbsp; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS ELBs</a>, and the<a href="http://www.haproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HAProxy systems</a>, sits some of most closely-guarded software in the world.</p>
<h2>The ever-increasing dominance of open-source</h2>
<p>The increasing dominance of open-source software seems particularly true with respect to infrastructure software.&nbsp; While security software has often been open-source through necessity — no-one would trust it otherwise — infrastructure is becoming the dominant category of open-source. Look at databases — <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/guided-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RethinkDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CouchDB</a>, <a href="https://influxdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a> (of which I am part of the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">development team</a>), or <a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cockroachdb</a>. Is there anyone today that would even consider developing a new closed-source database? Or take search technology — <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elasticsearch</a>, <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solr</a>, and <a href="http://www.blevesearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bleve</a> — all open-source. And <a href="https://www.linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> is so obvious, it is almost pointless to mention it.<br>
If you want to create a closed-source infrastructure solution, you better have an enormously compelling story, or be delivering it as part of a bigger package such as a software appliance.</p>
<h2>So where is the value?</h2>
<p>Compared to when I first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started programming,</a> that some of the most valuable companies in software now give away their product is astounding, when you actually think about it. So where is the real value within a such a company, when its product is free? It’s where it’s always been — just more so.</p>
<p>The real value is within the development team and its ideas, that the team behind the software are, and remain, innovative, execute well, and produce quality software. And that they remain so is key — so that it does not matter that what they produce is freely available.&nbsp; It is of little benefit to a competitor that the source is freely available, when the team behind the project is probably six months ahead — and often more — conceptually in terms of design, development and process.</p>
<h2>The economics of recruitment</h2>
<p>And the implications go far beyond how software is developed.<br>
It is generally accepted these days within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">The Valley</a> that large, older, firms find it particularly hard to hire. The excitement, and latitude for creativity, within a start-up has always appealed, and even more so now with the outstanding <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-28/facebook-s-22-billion-whatsapp-deal-buys-10-million-in-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial success of some</a>.</p>
<p>But a second-order effect is also prevalent — many developers baulk at the idea that their work may never be seen by their peers in the open-source community, and therefore may never help them progress in their careers. And it is at larger, older firms, that the least amount of open-source software is written — what <a href="http://paulgraham.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> calls <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downwind jobs</a>.</p>
<p>But Services remain part of the future — because while the code that Service software developers write may not be visible, the functionality is visible to the world and with the advent of cloud-computing, the power accruing to these developers is significant and growing. Services can hire, unlike the traditional firms.</p>
<h2>Possibilities for our grandchildren</h2>
<p>The rise of open-source has been a remarkable development in the history of economics and production. I often wonder what <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keynes</a>, Marx, and even Ricardo, would think of it all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>PostHog has pivoted <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>After 5 pivots in 6 months, we got into <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> last year, pivoted again whilst we were there and have now gone from the first commit to thousands of deployments, a team across 10 countries and $12M raised, in well under a year. We've a long way to go, but we're delighted at how it has gone so far.</p>
<p>This is that story and what we learned from it.</p>
<h2 id="youll-feel-silly"><a href="#youll-feel-silly" aria-label="youll feel silly permalink"></a>You'll feel silly</h2>
<p>It goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convince yourself then your family, friends and colleagues you have some great idea.</li>
<li>Quit your job.</li>
<li>Build it. Listen to the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a> way too much.</li>
<li>Everyone thinks your thing is terrible. Hopefully you realize.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nature of a startup is that you have to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6g-how-to-talk-to-users">talk to users</a>. Or so we've heard.</p>
<p>My sole focus for weeks on end was just to get meetings with people that we felt may have the same problem we were trying to solve.</p>
<h2 id="it-got-good-eventually-right"><a href="#it-got-good-eventually-right" aria-label="it got good eventually right permalink"></a>It got good eventually, right?</h2>
<p>In 9 months, we built 6 products and did more than 100 meetings with potential users.</p>
<p>The range of ideas we tried to solve looks broad, but the thing that connected all of them was that we tackled problems we'd experienced in our previous professional lives.</p>
<p>So, what did we build?</p>
<h3 id="1-sales-territory-management-tool"><a href="#1-sales-territory-management-tool" aria-label="1 sales territory management tool permalink"></a>1. Sales Territory Management Tool</h3>
<p>At one stage in my life, I was the VP of Sales at an enterprise software company. On paper, it looked like a glamorous job - I used to fly around the world with the sales team, and met with huge enterprise clients in fancy skyscrapers, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commerce_Centre">ICC in Hong Kong</a>:</p>

                </a></p>
<p>Despite this, the <em>majority</em> of your time in sales is spent getting nowhere. All those hotels, flights, calls, fastidiously wearing a suit in inappropriately warm weather - very few of those things result in anything.</p>
<p>Sidenote: this is why <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/strategy">product led growth</a> is so much better.</p>
<p>If you're not getting anywhere with a potential customer after a few weeks or months of trying, your time is better spent elsewhere. Yet systems that are the core products of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce">$17.1Bn revenue companies</a> come with a manually selected arbitrary number for the percentage probability that doesn't vary with time.</p>
<p>We pulled pipeline data from Hubspot or Salesforce, then used predictive analytics to work out how this curve looked based on historic data, then applied it to the current pipeline. Once a deal dropped below a certain threshold, we'd recommend you swap out that target company and pull a new one into the pipeline.</p>
<p>We confused a lot of people with this idea, because we were confused with whom we were targeting.</p>
<p>We got 15 sales leaders to agree to trying this out, sent them a link, then waited...</p>
<p>and waited...</p>
<p>just <em>one</em> person even clicked the sign up link. The rest didn't even try it.</p>
<p>With hindsight, it was way overpowered for tiny teams and we'd only have had a great fit for huge ones with a lot of data.</p>
<p>The only people interested in smaller teams were enthusiasts, but there wasn't an easy jump from that to a bigger market. We could have just worked on selling the product to big companies, but that would be <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/3O-why-big-deals-are-bad-for-startups">tough</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-crm-with-predictive-analytics"><a href="#2-crm-with-predictive-analytics" aria-label="2 crm with predictive analytics permalink"></a>2. CRM with Predictive Analytics</h3>
<p>One of our friends who ran a small sales team was a clear outliter. He had been using our first product a lot. We asked ourselves - why?</p>
<p>He had used it to <em>replace</em> his CRM. </p>
<p>Could we just do the whole lot in one place, and reimagine the CRM - would that make things feel simpler?</p>
<p>We positioned the product as a CRM for small companies, with predictive analytics for an even simpler experience managing everything. We tweaked the functionality to have more control over deals and contacts.</p>
<p>It suddenly got really hard to get anyone to talk to us.</p>
<p>There are many lightweight CRMs out there, and predictive analytics make more sense for those with more data, not startups with hardly any.</p>
<p>This was around the time that <a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> was getting pretty popular; we got overexcited, and kept using words like "blazing", "gorgeous", "brilliant". I blame too much time wasted reading <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/vc-brags-twitter/">VC Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>We didn't think through who we were building for. The market we were working on was very busy, so if I went back in time, I would have focused more on our differentiation - a product could make more sense than a platform. Tim and I also just weren't strong enough at design to differentiate on that alone.</p>
<p>After hundreds of messages to potential users, we eventually got a single customer for $20/month, who then didn't actually pay the invoice. If you're pushing this hard and getting nowhere, you don't have the magic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-vfn97QTr0">product market fit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-11-tool-with-predictive-analytics"><a href="#3-11-tool-with-predictive-analytics" aria-label="3 11 tool with predictive analytics permalink"></a>3. 1:1 Tool with Predictive Analytics</h3>
<p>Back to basics - what was the actual problem we were solving?</p>
<p>It was the prioritization of where to focus your sales efforts. If 90% of your deals deals won't close, you need to get good at not spending time on those that aren't going to close.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove">Andrew Grove</a> has an excellent book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=high+output+management&amp;qid=1610712757&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">High Output Management</a>. The premise is that your 1:1 meetings with your direct reports are your most leveraged time.</p>
<p>Yet, many managers in practise don't prepare, at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthog.com/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg">
                    <img src="https://posthog.com/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg" srcset="https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=175 175w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=350 350w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=700 700w, https://posthog.imgix.net/static/amazing-team-9b6c9c9a4eaaf13acd63fc7243e975f9.jpg?w=1000 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" title="A team that look a little bit like their happiness is staged" alt="A team that look a little bit like their happiness is staged" loading="lazy">
                </a></p>
<p>We changed the UX completely, and made an app that looked a bit like google docs, where you and your reports could each create an agenda in advance and take notes. The twist? The product would interpret your sales pipeline and would use predictive analytics to suggest specific deals to discuss that could be worth replacing or that had changed dramatically since the previous week.</p>
<p>We managed to get lots of meetings easily with this idea, and everyone reported not preparing to the standard they wanted. Did we have a silver bullet?</p>
<p>Despite giving out logins, only one team out of around 10 started using the tool. </p>
<p>We were flumoxed. This tool was simple, people were excited, but no one used it.</p>
<p>For those that haven't read it, <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, which I wish I'd read sooner, explains our downfall here perfectly:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If they haven't solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?

Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.</code></pre></div>
<p>If we'd have asked this question, we'd have saved a couple more weeks.</p>
<p>By this stage, we were thinking we just wanted to work with people that would at least try our stuff. These pesky heads of sales were just too capricious and we needed a break.</p>
<p>Software engineers, surely they'd be more willing to try something that we built. We moved on to a different idea we'd had. Voilà:</p>
<h3 id="4-technical-debt-monitoring-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request"><a href="#4-technical-debt-monitoring-tool-using-surveys-after-each-pull-request" aria-label="4 technical debt monitoring tool using surveys after each pull request permalink"></a>4. Technical Debt Monitoring Tool using Surveys after each Pull Request</h3>
<p>We'd seen the impact of technical debt not being paid off at the right rate in our past, and had the perspective that automation isn't key to solving it. We believed that engineers knew when it was worth tackling.</p>
<p>I spoke with every developer or engineering leader I'd ever worked with, and many I hadn't. They all said this problem was a huge pain point.</p>
<p>So we built a survey tool that integrated with git repositories. After each pull request, it would ask the developer to answer a few quick questions - did anything slow them down, what type of problem was it, and roughly how much time was wasted. The tool would then visualize the code base against time lost to help surface where to start.</p>
<p>We got quite a lot of users, and we got into YCombinator with this idea. Three weeks into the batch, we had reached 600 users, with a 50% response rate to the surveys.</p>
<p>We had started trying to charge people for the product. But we kept getting feedback that although it was a nice way to log issues, it just wasn't helping solve the problem. A few teams converted at very low order values with a lot of pushing, but it was clear we had a problem.</p>
<p>It turns out everyone has problems with technical debt, but solving it involves changing how teams prioritize. Product teams weren't using the tool, and they were often dictating what people built.</p>
<p>After a meetup with our YC friends at a cool <a href="http://sparksocialsf.com/">food truck spot</a>, we took a long walk back to our house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_District,_San_Francisco">Castro</a>. We were thinking about how to solve our product woes. Could it turn into a piece of roadmapping software? Would it need to integrate with the roadmap software already in use? We just didn't feel excited about building these things out.</p>

        </a></p>
<p>A couple of days later, driving between Mountain View and San Francisco, we realized that we just weren't the right people to run this business.</p>
<p>Although Tim had struggled with technical debt first hand, neither of us had solved it.

<p>Along the way, we learned a lot about how developers and product managers work together. We'd also created a big list of future ideas we'd had whilst building all the above things out. If you can't stop thinking of other ideas, you probably are building something you don't like. This all came into play for idea 6 later on (the good one).</p>
<p>So what did we do next?</p>

			<p>Last week, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/ruby-comes-to-cloud-functions">announced</a> the public beta of the Ruby runtime for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Cloud Functions</a>, Google’s functions-as-a-service (FaaS) hosting platform. Ruby support has lagged a bit behind other languages over the past year or so, but now that we’ve caught up, I thought I’d share some of the design process behind the product.</p>

<p>This article is not a traditional design document. I won’t go through the design itself step-by-step. Instead, I want to discuss some of the design issues we faced, the decisions we made, and why we made them, because it was an interesting exercise in figuring out how to fuse Ruby conventions with those of the public cloud. Some of the trade-offs we made are, I think, emblematic of the challenges the Ruby community as a whole is facing as the industry evolves.</p>

<h2 id="a-ruby-way-of-doing-serverless">A Ruby way of doing serverless</h2>

<p>Bringing Ruby support to a serverless product is a lot more involved than you might expect. At the most basic level, a language runtime is just a Ruby installation, and sure, it’s not hard to configure a Ruby image and install it on a VM. But things become more complex when you bring “serverless” into the mix. Severless is much more than just automatic maintenance and scaling. It’s an entirely different way of thinking about compute resources, one that goes contrary to much of we’ve been taught about deploying Ruby apps for the past fifteen years. When the Ruby team at Google Cloud took on the task of designing the Ruby runtime for Cloud Functions, we were also taking on the daunting task of proposing a <em>Ruby way of doing serverless</em>. While remaining true to the Ruby idioms, practices, and tools familiar to our community, we also had to rethink how we approach web application development at almost every level, from code, to dependencies, persistence, testing, everything.</p>

<p>This article will examine our approach to five different aspects of the design: function syntax, concurrency and lifecycle, testing, dependencies, and standards. In each case, we’ll see a balance between the importance of remaining true to our Ruby roots, and the desire to embrace the new serverless paradigms. We tried very hard to maintain continuity with the traditional Ruby way of doing things, and we also took cues from other Google Cloud Functions language runtimes, as well as precedents set by serverless products from other cloud providers. However, in a few cases, we chose to blaze a different trail. We did so when we felt that current approaches either abused a language feature, or were misleading and encouraged the wrong ideas about serverless app development.</p>

<p>It’s possible, even likely, that some of these decisions will eventually prove to have been wrong. That’s why I’m offering this article now, to discuss what we’ve done and to start the conversation about how we as the Ruby community practice serverless app development. The good news is that Ruby is a very flexible language, and we will have plenty of opportunity to adapt as we learn and as our needs evolve.</p>

<p>So let’s take a look at some of the initial design decisions and trade-offs we made and why we made them.</p>

<h2 id="functional-ruby">Functional Ruby</h2>

<p>“Functions-as-a-Service” (FaaS) is currently one of the more popular serverless paradigms. Google’s Cloud Functions is just one implementation. Many other major cloud providers have their own FaaS product, and there are <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">open source implementations</a> as well.</p>

<p>The idea, of course, is to use a programming model centered not around web servers, but around <em>functions</em>: stateless pieces of code that take input arguments and return results. It seems like a simple, almost obvious, change in terminology, but it actually has profound implications.</p>

<p><img src="https://daniel-azuma.com/img/posts/cloud-functions-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of a cloud function"></p>

<p>The first challenge for Ruby is that, unlike many other programming languages, Ruby actually <em>doesn’t have</em> first-class functions. Ruby is first and foremost an object-oriented language. When we write code and wrap it in a <code>def</code>, we are writing a <em>method</em>, code that runs in response to a <em>message</em> sent to an <em>object</em>. This is an important distinction, because the objects and classes that form the context of a method call are not part of the serverless abstraction. So their presence can complicate a serverless application, and even mislead us when we’re writing it.</p>

<p>For example, some FaaS frameworks let you write a function with a <code>def</code> at the top level of a Ruby file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>handler</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>:,</span> <span>context</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>"Hello, world!"</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While this code appears straightforward, it’s important to remember what it actually does. It adds this “function” as a private method on the <code>Object</code> class, the base class of the Ruby class hierarchy. In other words, the “function” has been added to <em>nearly every object in the Ruby virtual machine</em>. (Unless, of course, the application changes the main object and class context when loading the file, a technique that carries other risks.) At best, this breaks encapsulation and single responsibility. At worst, it risks interfering with the functionality of your application, its dependencies, or even the Ruby standard library. This is why such “top level” methods, while common in simple single-file Ruby scripts and Rakefiles, are not recommended in larger Ruby applications.</p>

<p>The Google Ruby team decided this issue was serious enough that we chose a different syntax, writing functions as blocks:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>require</span> <span>"functions_framework"</span>
<span>FunctionsFramework</span><span>.</span><span>http</span><span>(</span><span>"handler"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>request</span><span>|</span>
  <span>"Hello, world!"</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This provides a Ruby-like way to define functions without modifying the <code>Object</code> base class. It also has a few side benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name (“handler” in this case) is just a string argument. It doesn’t need to be a legal Ruby method name, nor is there any concern of it colliding with a Ruby keyword.</li>
  <li>Blocks exhibit more traditional lexical scoping than do methods, so this will behave more similarly to functions in other languages.</li>
  <li>The block syntax makes it easier to manage function definitions. For example, it’s possible to “undefine” functions cleanly, which is important for testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are trade-offs. Among them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The syntax is slightly more verbose.</li>
  <li>It requires a library to provide the interface for defining functions as blocks. (Here, Ruby follows other language runtimes for Cloud Functions by utilizing a <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-ruby">Functions Framework</a> library.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We decided it was worth these trade-offs for the goal of properly distinguishing functions.</p>



<p>Concurrency is hard. This is one of the key observations underlying the design of serverless in general, and functions-as-a-service in particular: that we live in a concurrent world and we need ways to cope. The functional paradigm addresses concurrency by insisting that functions not share state (except through an external persistence system such as a queue or database).</p>

<p>This is in fact another reason we chose to use block syntax rather than method syntax. Methods imply objects, which carry state in the form of instance variables, state that might not work as expected in a stateless FaaS environment. Eschewing methods is a subtle but effective syntactic way to discourage practices we know to be problematic.</p>

<p>That said, what if you need to share <em>resources</em>, such as database connection pools? When would you initialize such resources, and how would you access them?</p>

<p>For this purpose, the Ruby runtime supports <em>startup functions</em> that can initialize resources and passes them into function calls. Importantly, while the startup function can create resources, normal functions can only read them.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>require</span> <span>"functions_framework"</span>

<span># Use an on_startup block to initialize a shared client and store it in</span>
<span># the global shared data.</span>
<span>FunctionsFramework</span><span>.</span><span>on_startup</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>require</span> <span>"google/cloud/storage"</span>
  <span>set_global</span> <span>:storage_client</span><span>,</span> <span>Google</span><span>::</span><span>Cloud</span><span>::</span><span>Storage</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># The shared storage_client can be accessed by all function invocations</span>
<span># via the global shared data.</span>
<span>FunctionsFramework</span><span>.</span><span>http</span> <span>"storage_example"</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>request</span><span>|</span>
  <span>bucket</span> <span>=</span> <span>global</span><span>(</span><span>:storage_client</span><span>).</span><span>bucket</span> <span>"my-bucket"</span>
  <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>bucket</span><span>.</span><span>file</span> <span>"path/to/my-file.txt"</span>
  <span>file</span><span>.</span><span>download</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that we chose to define special methods <code>global</code> and <code>set_global</code> to interact with global resources. (By the way, these are not methods on Object, but methods on a specific class we use as the function context.) Again, we could have used more traditional idioms such as Ruby global variables, or even a constructor and instance variables, to pass information from startup code to function calls. However, those idioms would have communicated the wrong things. We’re not writing ordinary Ruby classes and methods where sharing data is normal, but <em>serverless functions</em> where sharing data is hazardous if even possible, and we felt it was important for the <em>syntax</em> to emphasize the distinction. The special methods were a deliberate design decision, to discourage practices could be dangerous in the presence of concurrency.</p>

<h2 id="test-first">Test first</h2>

<p>A strong testing culture is central to the Ruby community. Popular frameworks, such as Rails, acknowledge this and encourage active testing by providing testing tools and scaffolding as part of the framework, and the Ruby runtime for Google Cloud Functions follows suit by providing testing tools for serverless functions.</p>

<p>The FaaS paradigm actually fits very well with tests. Functions are by nature easily testable; simply pass in arguments and assert against results. In particular, you don’t need to spin up a web server to run tests, because web servers are not part of the abstraction. The Ruby runtime provides a module of helper methods for creating HTTP request and Cloud Event objects to use as inputs, and otherwise most tests are very straightforward to write.</p>

<p>One of the main testing challenges we encountered, though, had to do with testing <em>initialization code</em>. Indeed, this is an issue that some of Google’s Ruby team members have had with other frameworks, including Rails: it is difficult to test an app’s initialization process, because framework initialization typically happens outside the tests, before they run. We therefore designed a way for tests …</p></div></div>

The marketplace listings include user reviews, payments, videos, and more. App makers can even use paid ads within the marketplace to get in front of more potential customers. This is a marketplace with plenty of opportunity and plenty of competition.</p><p><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>*</h3><p>Wordpress powers a huge percentage of all websites. It's the most popular website builder (or content management system). Their plugin marketplace has user reviews, download numbers, and more. Most plugins are free, and most of the paid ones charge one time fees. This is another marketplace with plenty of opportunity and plenty of competition.</p><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a></h3><p>Squarespace is another popular website builder. If you listen to podcasts, you'll likely have heard one of their ads. Their marketplace is quite tiny and less advanced then a lot of the above. It doesn't have user reviews, but does have pricing information.</p><p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/extensions/home" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a></h3><p>Webflow is a website builder targeting no-code makers and designers. It seems to be growing rapidly, but their marketplace is still super basic.</p><p><a href="https://university.webflow.com/integrations" target="_blank">Marketplace →</a><br></p><h3><a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>*</h3><p>Wix is another website builder which is mostly used by small businesses.

The case is milled, that is, cut from a piece of plastic on CNC and then painted. The final version will be injection molded with color premixed inside the plastic grains. But the final device will look exactly like this. The Flipper has gotten slightly bigger due to two additional PCBs inside.</p><p>Next, we'll talk about the current project status, tasks and problems, upcoming manufacturing roadmap and access to the pledge manager.</p><h2 id="manufacturing-plan">Manufacturing Plan</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img width="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/v8/iz/jcv8izitgvit-m1xfxoddltmwge.png">We'll be honest: <b>we won't be able to ship Flippers to all backers in February</b>. The devices will be produced gradually, starting with a very small batches and gradually increasing in volume to reduce the risk of having any defects. We really want to make a cool product that is perfect in every aspect from mechanics to electronics. Any mistake in a large batch will be fatal and it will be impossible to withdraw.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Given the huge expectations of our backers, we simply cannot afford to release an unfinished device. We will gradually produce and ship small batches to friendly developers and those who applied to the early adopters program. These people will act as beta testers, will install new firmware versions and fill the bug reports. But before you apply into an early adopters, keep in mind that you might end up with a device that has some serious bugs.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/1o/sv/kf1osvgb42n72nbbop-19mxsnw0.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption>Flipper gradual manufacturing plan</figcaption></figure><p>We expect the first small batch to contain defects in mechanics and electronics, which will become apparent after a period of use. For example, after a month of usage, buttons on the joystick may stuck occasionally, a USB port or, for example, iButton pogo-pins could break out. We will of course run automated tests, but they do not cover all potential problems that may arise. Therefore, we mark such batches as high risk. By the end of spring, we expect to have a stable mass production of fully tested devices.</p><h2 id="early-adopters-program">Early Adopters Program</h2><p>If you're willing to take the risk to get Flipper early, sign up for the Early Adopters Program. You should be aware that you may face mechanical defects and other problems. You can apply <a href="https://forms.gle/MWoCTdqTZXD41qS76">here</a> <strong>(only available to Kickstarter backers)</strong>.</p><p>Keep in mind that the firmware is now very unstable at the moment: it has a lot of bugs, many features are yet to be completed, the graphical interface for some features is not ready, and they have to be launched from the console without displaying them on the screen. Every day we release a new firmware builds and all beta testers will have to constantly update and test them.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mp/u9/86/mpu986dwzpeluccbuzruv2sta1o.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption>Early Flippers will ship with unstable firmware</figcaption></figure><p>The firmware repository on Github will be open by the time there are enough developers with Flippers on hand to contribute to the firmware code. We plan to intensively support the firmware for at least 2 years after the release of Flipper, so we prepare all backers in advance that when you receive the device, not all features may work there. These features will be added over time in firmware updates.</p><h2 id="pledge-manager-launch">Pledge Manager Launch</h2><p>Within a few days, we will open access to the pledge manager, where you'll be able to specify the shipping address and pay for delivery, select the case color and add more Flippers to an existing order. It will also be possible to add a silicone case and special development modules to the order. Now we are finishing the shipping service API integration to automatically calculate taxes and shipping costs depending on the weight of the parcel.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/f9/dj/8vf9djp_su1w1n1bbyoxrmjkbj8.png" alt=""><figcaption>Pledge manager screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>An invite with access to the pledge manager will be sent to your email address, which you set on the Kickstarter profile, and to your Kickstarter inbox. Do not be afraid to miss the letter, the system will keep reminding you about it until you complete all the steps. Those backers who don't complete the survey within a month will be notified separately.</p><h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2><p>Hardware development was our top priority because hardware, unlike firmware, cannot be upgraded once released and shipped to the users. Any flaw here would be fatal.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/3k/ks/bm3kksj92g2eprcvddu-iywekhi.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Now we are finishing the antennas fine-tuning, tweaking the component values and eliminating minor roughness. It remains to test Flipper with extreme conditions like temperature drops, vibration, shock, and more. In general, we can say that the hardware design is complete. Now we only make minor corrections that are requested by the certifying laboratory and the factory.</p><h3 id="sub-1-ghz-wideband-antenna-fine-tuning">Sub-1 GHz Wideband Antenna Fine-tuning</h3><p>This is the most challenging subsystem for us. The 300-900 MHz range support just on a single transceiver is a very difficult task. We use a circuit with three (!) switching radio paths and our own antenna design. The complexity of such a circuit is that it must pass all certification standards (FCC, EC and others), such as parasitic harmonics, frequency deviations, etc.</p><p>Now we are adjusting the characteristics of the antenna feed system to the rules and standards of the certification laboratory. This is a time-consuming process.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/xa/_k/qnxa_kigg9verudqzno64kj_jri.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption>Sub-1 GHz module parts</figcaption></figure><h3 id="certification">Certification</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img width="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/hd/f0/gfhdf0onmw__vou1qdzck-bfsg0.jpeg">In order to officially import the device into the EU and the US and sell it in stores like Amazon, we need to obtain a certificate of RF compliance in those countries. The fact is that for different countries these standards are different, and we need to make several different versions of devices that correspond to different standards. These are legal tasks that are far from development and production, but they take time and we cannot avoid them. They also complicate logistics as we must make several different device versions with different SKUs for each region. <i>(Regional differences will only be at the firmware level)</i></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>

</tbody></table><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3><p>The preparation for body molding and assembly consists of dozens of very small fixes. Now we are coordinating with the factory on all production details. It is necessary to take into account how the part will be removed from the mold, where the plastic injection points will be and what type of molding is optimal for each part.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/kk/n8/mvkkn8wfcm8djj2eofc9k3mfba8.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of fixes sent by the molding factory</figcaption></figure><p>The factory makes adjustments, calculates material stress, cooling rates, runner positions, etc. The difficulty with this process is that any mechanics redesign involves revising the position of the electronics inside and affects the assembly process. Therefore, even a 0.1mm shift of the stiffeners can often lead to changes in the PCB outline. This is a time-consuming process as it requires the participation of all teams at once.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/4b/9-/lj4b9-ubj19j9uwuq3eb4y7wmbm.png" alt=""></figure><p>Three factories are involved in production, and each of them sets its own requirements. Now we are setting up the assembly and testing flow at every stage.</p><h3 id="assembly-flow">Assembly Flow</h3><p>The entire assembly process has a strict time requirements, each step, each part and test process should fit into scheduled time interval. Should one step take longer, it won't be possible to produce tens of thousands of devices in a controllable way. Currently the assembly of one Flipper along with testing and firmware flashing must take no longer than 420 seconds!</p><p>We prepare the process and pre-assembled parts of the device to fit in this time. This is what the assembly instructions look like.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a2/bg/ps/a2bgps4ofhipr7epuaxdaeoyfdw.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>First, there is an intermediate assembly of individual modules, for example an infrared window is soldered to the top case cover. To do this, plastic pin is melted with a special soldering iron.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/yt/zo/szytzotavrgtjkun-_jphdsopum.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>The springs and joystick buttons are installed in the screen overlay. This element consists of 8 parts: a snap, 3 springs, 3 buttons (center, big circle, back button), status LED light guide.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qk/61/er/qk61erci3i4hmuz48oys_9s3r9w.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>The main PCB connects to the screen overlay with joystick and button, and latches to the PCBs to form a ready for assembly module.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/ty/e7/futye7ptxkmslrzh_edtbr_lhuq.jpeg" alt=""></figure><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ll/ju/pc/lljupc5swsjvjpskdnrr4krkw7q.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>An iButton PCB, a battery, a vibration motor are installed in the carcass.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/hu/1p/behu1pboneqmhqlzeaivbsvvzyg.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>An NFC board is attached to the carcass and secured with latches.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/4s/et/tk4sethlaj2okuhdibdgafxrdhe.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>In total, the assembly consists of 20 steps, which ends with the installation of the bottom cover. Then the device is sent for firmware flashing and testing.</p><h2 id="custom-components">Custom Components</h2><p>Most of the parts which Flipper consists of are serial components ordered from suppliers. But there are a few electronic components that are custom made specifically for Flipper. This requires placing an order for the production of each component with a solid manufacturer, communicate on details and agreements.</p><h3 id="sub-1-ghz-wideband-antenna">Sub-1 GHz Wideband Antenna</h3><p>The antenna we need cannot simply be bought, so we order the winding of this wire antenna specially according to our drawings. It should simultaneously work well on all the ranges from 300 to 900 MHz and at the same time fit into our case. Now we are checking that the manufactured antennas really meet our requirements.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-l/qp/ul/-lqpulr75cqwwcakiajyi2onw4k.png" alt=""></figure><h3 id="ibutton-pad-pogo-pin">iButton Pad Pogo-pin</h3><p>For the iButton pad, we use a pin of a non-standard length, so we had to order its production separately.</p><figure><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/yz/rx/hfyzrxetz0yqwrljnlc2kfusvxk.png" alt=""></figure><p>This component is also non-standard and is produced for us. For prototypes, we used a combination of two headers with 8 pins and 2 pins, which is not suitable for the final device. Finding a manufacturer of good headers was not easy.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/01/23yg348jcotkwukhp0c4tlx3p3ri.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/23yg348jcotkwukhp0c4tlx3p3ri.jpg 600w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/23yg348jcotkwukhp0c4tlx3p3ri.jpg 1000w, https://blog.flipperzero.one/content/images/2021/01/23yg348jcotkwukhp0c4tlx3p3ri.jpg 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A combination of two headers is a prototyping workaround</figcaption></figure><h2 id="p-s-">P.S.</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p3/-a/fx/p3-afx1atw_bobcbgaup2p-uamg.jpeg" width="150">We are very concerned about final shipping date postponement, but we hope you can understand it.

<p>Whether you're a software developer or a sysadmin, I bet you're using SSH keys.
Pushing your commits to Github or managing your Unix systems, it's best practice to do this over SSH with public key authentication rather than passwords.
However, as time flies, many of you are using older keys and not aware of the need to generate fresh ones to protect your privates much better.
In this post I'll demonstrate how to transition to an Ed25519 key smoothly, why you would want this and show some tips and tricks on the way there.</p>
<div>
<p>Tl;dr:</p>
<p>Generate your new key with <code>ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519</code>, specify a strong passphrase and read further if you need a smooth transition.</p>
</div>
<p>I'm planning to publish some more posts on SSH tips &amp; tricks, so keep an eye on my blog for more.
This post will focus on about SSH keys as user public key authentication.</p>
<h2 id="dsa-and-rsa-1024-bit-are-deprecated-now">DSA and RSA 1024 bit are deprecated now<a href="#dsa-and-rsa-1024-bit-are-deprecated-now" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>If you've created your key more than about four years ago with the default options it's probably insecure (RSA &lt; 2048 bits).
Even worse, I've seen tweeps, colleagues and friends still using DSA keys (<code>ssh-dss</code> in OpenSSH format) recently.
That's a key type similar to RSA, but limited to 1024 bits size and therefore <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/5100/12948">recommended against</a> for a long time.
It's plainly insecure and refused for valid reasons in recent OpenSSH versions (see also the <a href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0">changelog for 7.0</a>).</p>
<p>The sad thing about it is that I see posts on how to re-enable DSA key support rather than moving to a more secure type of key.
Really, it's unwise to follow instructions to change the configuration for <code>PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes</code> or <code>HostKeyAlgorithms</code> (host keys are for a later post).
Instead, upgrade your keys!</p>
<p><img alt="Picture of an ancient key" src="https://blog.g3rt.nl/images/20160923_old_key_picture.jpg"></p>
<p>Compare DSA with the technology of locks using keys like this one.
You wouldn't want this type of key to unlock your front door, right?</p>

<h2 id="determine-your-current-situation">Determine your current situation<a href="#determine-your-current-situation" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>List all your keys:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> <span>for</span> keyfile in ~/.ssh/id_*<span>;</span> <span>do</span> ssh-keygen -l -f <span>"${</span><span>keyfile</span><span>}"</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span> <span>|</span> uniq
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>DSA or RSA 1024 bits: red flag. Unsafe.</li>
<li>RSA 2048: yellow recommended to change</li>
<li>RSA 3072/4096: great, but Ed25519 has some benefits!</li>
<li>ECDSA: depends. Recommended to change</li>
<li>Ed25519: wow cool, but are you brute-force safe?</li>
</ul>

<p>You're probably thinking… "I'm using my key for a long time, I don't want to change them everywhere now."
Valid point, but you don't have to! It's good to know you can have multiple keys on your system and your SSH client will pick the right one for the right system automatically.</p>
<p>It's part of the SSH protocol that it can offer multiple keys and the server picks the one your client will have to prove it has possession of the private key by a challenge.
See it in action adding some verbosity to the SSH connect command (<code>-vvv</code>).
Also if you're using an SSH agent you can load multiple keys and it will discover them all.
Easy as that.</p>
<h2 id="youll-like-the-twisted-edwards-curve">You'll like the Twisted Edwards curve<a href="#youll-like-the-twisted-edwards-curve" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Most common is the RSA type of key, also known as <code>ssh-rsa</code> with SSH.
It's very compatible, but also slow and potentially insecure if created with a small amount of bits (&lt; 2048).
We just learned that your SSH client can handle multiple keys, so enable yourself with the newest faster elliptic curve cryptography and enjoy the very compact key format it provides!</p>
<p>Ed25519 keys are short. Very short. If you're used to copy multiple lines of characters from system to system you'll be happily surprised with the size. The public key is just about 68 characters. It's also much faster in authentication compared to secure RSA (3072+ bits).</p>
<p>Generating an Ed25519 key is done using the <code>-t ed25519</code> option to the ssh-keygen command.</p>
<p>Ed25519 is a reference implementation for EdDSA using Twisted Edward curves (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Edwards_curve">Wikipedia link</a>).</p>

<p>When generating the keypair, you're asked for a passphrase to encrypt the private key with.
If you will ever lose your private key it should protect others from impersonating you because it will be encrypted with the passphrase.
To actually prevent this, one should make sure to prevent easy brute-forcing of the passphrase.</p>
<p>OpenSSH key generator offers two options to resistance to brute-force password cracking: using the new OpenSSH key format and increasing the amount of key derivation function rounds.
It slows down the process of unlocking the key, but this is what prevents efficient brute-forcing by a malicious user too.
I'd say experiment with the amount of rounds on your system.
Start at about 100 rounds.
On my system it takes about one second to decrypt and load the key once per day using an agent.
Very much acceptable, imo.</p>
<p>With <code>ssh-keygen</code> use the <code>-o</code> option for the new RFC4716 key format and the use of a modern key derivation function powered by bcrypt.
Use the <code>-a &lt;num&gt;</code> option for <code>&lt;num&gt;</code> amount of rounds.</p>
<p>Actually, it appears that when creating a Ed25519 key the <code>-o</code> option is implied.</p>
<p>The OpenSSH manpages are not really explanatory about the 'new' format.
I found this article pretty useful: <a href="http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/new-openssh-key-format-and-bcrypt-pbkdf">"new openssh key format and bcrypt pbkdf" on www.tedunangst.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generate-your-new-sexy-ed25519-key">Generate your new sexy Ed25519 key<a href="#generate-your-new-sexy-ed25519-key" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span><span>$</span> ssh-keygen -o -a <span>100</span> -t ed25519
</span><span>Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.</span>
<span>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):</span>

<span>Your public key has been saved in /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.</span>
<span>The key fingerprint is:</span>
<span>SHA256: [...] gert@hostname</span>
<span>The key's randomart image is: [...]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note the line 'Your identification has been saved in /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519'.
Your current RSA/DSA keys are next to it in the same <code>~/.ssh</code> folder.
As with any other key you can copy the public key in <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code> to target hosts for authentication.</p>
<h2 id="multi-key-aware-ssh-client">Multi-key aware SSH client<a href="#multi-key-aware-ssh-client" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>All keys available on default paths will be autodetected by SSH client applications, including the SSH agent via ssh-add.
So, if you were using an application like ssh/scp/rsync before like...</p>

<p>it will now offer multiple public keys to the server and the server will request proof of possession for a matching entry for authentication.
And your daily use of the <code>ssh-add</code> command will not change and autodiscover the Ed25519 key:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span><span>$</span> ssh-add
</span><span>Enter passphrase for /home/gert/.ssh/id_rsa:</span>
<span>Identity added: /home/gert/.ssh/id_rsa (gert@hostname)</span>
<span>Identity added: /home/gert/.ssh/id_ed25519 (gert@hostname)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It not only discovered both keys, it also loaded them by entering a single passphrase (because it's the same)!</p>
<p>We've reached a very important goal now.
Without any change to your daily routine we can slowly change the existing configuration on remote hosts to accept the Ed25519 key.
In the meantime the RSA key will still work.
Great, right!?</p>
<h2 id="change-or-set-a-passphrase">Change or set a passphrase<a href="#change-or-set-a-passphrase" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>If you're afraid this will change your key, don't worry.
The private part of your keypair is encrypted with a passphrase which only exists locally on your machine.
Change it as often as you like.
This is recommended to prevent abuse in case the key file gets into the wrong hands.
Repeat for all your key files to ensure a new key format with 100 bcrypt KDF rounds:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p -o -a <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="upgrade-your-current-rsa-key">Upgrade your current RSA key<a href="#upgrade-your-current-rsa-key" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Using Ed25519 will (and should) work in most situations by now, but legacy systems may not support them as of yet.
The best fallback is a strong RSA keypair for this.</p>
<p>While the OpenSSH client supports multiple RSA keys, it requires configuration/command line options to specify the path so it's rather error-prone.
Instead, I'd recommend upgrading your existing key in-place to keep things simple once this is done.
Depending on the strength (key size) of your current RSA key you can migrate urgently or comfortably.</p>
<p>In case you have a weak RSA key still, move it out of the way from the standard path and generate a new one of 4096 bits size:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy
<span>$</span> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy.pub
<span>$</span> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b <span>4096</span> -o -a <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are using an agent, manually point it to all your keys:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_legacy ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you are finished the transition on all remote targets you can go back to convenience and let it autodiscover your new RSA and Ed25519 keys; simply omit the keyfile arguments.</p>
<h2 id="software-support-for-ed25519">Software support for Ed25519<a href="#software-support-for-ed25519" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Support is available since OpenSSH 6.5 and well adopted in the Unix world OSs for workstations.
Ubuntu 14.04+, Debian 8+, CentOS/RedHat 7+ etc. all support it already.
(If you have details about Mac OS X please drop a line, couldn't find it with a quick search).
Some software like custom desktop key agents may not like the new keys for several reasons (see below <a href="#my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore">about the Gnome-keyring</a> for example).</p>
<p>Github works pretty well too, by the way.
Launchpad and Gerrit code review however, seem to require RSA keys unfortunately.
PuTTY on Windows? See below.</p>
<h2 id="my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore">My Gnome-keyring doesn't work anymore<a href="#my-gnome-keyring-doesnt-work-anymore" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>The Gnome-keyring, as used in Ubuntu Unity at least, fails to read the new RFC4716 format keys but reports success.
It's bugged.
More details here in <a href="https://askubuntu.com/q/564821/88802">my AskUbuntu Q&amp;A post</a>.
I'd recommend disabling the Gnome keyring for SSH agent use and use the plain OpenSSH agent instead.</p>
<h2 id="im-using-windows-with-putty">I'm using Windows with PuTTY<a href="#im-using-windows-with-putty" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>Sorry, I'm not using PuTTY, but make sure to upgrade first.
This page suggests Ed25519 support since a late-2015 version according to a <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/ed25519.html">wishlist item</a>.
Generally speaking, I'm not too excited with the speed of implementation of security features in it.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-the-ultimate-secure-ssh-keypair">Is this the ultimate secure SSH keypair?<a href="#is-this-the-ultimate-secure-ssh-keypair" title="Permanent link"> </a></h2>
<p>We've taken some steps, important ones, but it's far from ultimate security.
When dealing with high assurance environments I would strongly discourage key usage like described in this post as this holds the unencrypted private key in memory.
Instead, use hardware security (smart cards) to avoid leaking keys even from memory dumps.
It's not covered in this post, mainly because it requires a hardware device you need to buy and secondly because the limitations are device dependent.
A nice cute solution would be to make use of your TPM already …</p></div></div>

      <p>Im stillen KÃ¤mmerlein arbeitet ownCloud seit Ã¼ber einem Jahr an der neuen Version seiner Software und zeigt nun zum ersten Mal sein neues Projekt Infinite Scale â€“ allerdings sind die Entwickler nicht langsam, sondern haben sich viel vorgenommen. Bis einschlieÃŸlich ownCloud X ist die Software eine klassische LAMP-Applikation: Im Hintergrund werkelt MySQL, Apache serviert PHP-Seiten und das gesamte Konstrukt lÃ¤uft Ã¼blicherweise auf einer Linux-Installation.</p>

<p>Im Laufe der Jahre sind die ownCloud-Entwickler allerdings an immer mehr Performance- und Skalierbarkeitsgrenzen gestoÃŸen, deren Ursache zumeist in entsprechenden Limitierungen in PHP liegt. Wer groÃŸe ownCloud-Installationen betreibt, kennt das: Je mehr Nutzer und Dateien die Instanz verwaltet, desto trÃ¤ger wird sie mit der Zeit. RegelmÃ¤ÃŸig sehen Admins sich zudem mit Speicherplatzmangel konfrontiert, denn bisher speichert ownCloud die Dateien seiner Nutzer lokal auf einem normalen Dateisystem ab. Wird der Platz dort knapp, ist das Problem gar nicht so leicht zu umschiffen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_goodbye_php_0">Goodbye, PHP</h3>
<p>Alle <a href="https://www.heise.de/thema/OwnCloud">diese alten ZÃ¶pfe</a> planen die Entwickler in ownCloud Infinite Scale endgÃ¼ltig abzuschneiden. Dabei handelt es sich mehr Revolution denn Evolution: Ihren alten Code treten die Entwickler fast vollstÃ¤ndig in die Tonne und ersetzen ihn durch einen kompletten Rewrite in Go. oCIS folgt einem Modell aus drei Schichten: Die unterste Schicht kÃ¼mmert sich um das Speichern von Dateien, die mittlere Schicht umfasst alle Kern-Dienste und die dritte Schicht ist das ebenfalls vollstÃ¤ndig neu geschriebene Webinterface.</p>

</a-lightbox>




<p>Der Kern von ownCloud besteht kÃ¼nftig aus verschiedenen Microservices, die einander per gRPC Befehle und Anweisungen zusenden. Die Entwickler bÃ¼ndeln die MESH-Software Traefik fest mit oCIS, um sich um Themen wie Loadbalancing und sichere Kommunikation innerhalb des Service-Netzwerks keine Gedanken machen zu mÃ¼ssen. Was im Umkehrschluss bedeutet: Reichen die laufenden Instanzen eines bestimmten ownCloud-Dienstes nicht mehr aus, lassen sich zusÃ¤tzliche Instanzen desselben Dienstes ad hoc starten.</p>
<p>Architektonisch nutzt oCIS diverse Vorteile von Go zur Beschleunigung. Fordert der Nutzer kÃ¼nftig eine spezielle Aktion per API oder Webinterface an, kÃ¼mmern die einzelnen oCIS-Microservices sich im Hintergrund darum. Der Anwender muss nicht warten, bis die jeweilige Aktion erfolgreich ausgefÃ¼hrt ist, bevor er den nÃ¤chsten Befehl absenden kann. Der Effekt findet sich auch auf der Code-Ebene wieder, wo Go anders als PHP echte NebenlÃ¤ufigkeit beherrscht und damit mehrere Operationen zur selben Zeit ausfÃ¼hren kann.</p>
<p>Obendrein reduziert der Umstieg auf Microservices den administrativen Aufwand von ownCloud. Eine externe Datenbank wie MySQL benÃ¶tigt die Software kÃ¼nftig nicht mehr â€“ um ihre Datenhaltung kÃ¼mmern sich eigene Microservices.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">Differential dataflow</a> is a library that lets you write simple dataflow programs and a) then runs them in parallel and b) efficiently updates the outputs when new inputs arrive. Compared to competition like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">kafka streams</a>, it can handle more complex computations and provides dramatically better throughput and latency while using much less memory.</p>
<p>But I'm only aware of a few companies that use it in production, even though it's been around for 5 years. </p>
<p>Possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's missing some important feature, like persistence? </li>
<li>It's had very little advertising?</li>
<li>The api is too hard to use?</li>
<li>The docs / tutorials are not good enough?</li>
<li>Rust is intimidating?</li>
<li>No company to provide paid support?</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem plausible, but it's not clear which are most important.</p>
<p>Even more surprising is that noone has copied the ideas into some enterprise friendly java monstrosity - despite the fact that differential dataflow is open source and is explained in depth in many papers and blog posts.</p>
<p>I'm interested because <a href="https://materialize.com/">materialize</a> is expending a huge amount of effort adding a SQL layer on top of differential dataflow. That's all very well for people who like SQL, but I'm curious whether there are also potential users who would have been perfectly happy with javascript/python/R bindings and a good tutorial? There are probably multiple niches to be served here.</p>
<p>If you considered using differential dataflow and decided against, please <a href="mailto:jamie@scattered-thoughts.net">let me know</a> why.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got feedback in the form of ~20 emails and ~100 comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25867693">hn</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7zeb3x/why_isn_t_differential_dataflow_more">lobsters</a>. Thanks to everyone who took the time to reach out - it was very helpful.</p>
<p>(To clarify for many fine but confused commenters - I did not make differential dataflow. I'm just trying to find out what more needs to be done to be useful in that niche.)</p>
<p>Reasons given fell in a few buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never heard of differential dataflow </li>
<li>Want a complete drop-in solution (builtin integrations for various other tools, orchestration, monitoring, support, hosting etc) rather than a choose-your-own-adventure library</li>
<li>Api too difficult / docs not good enough</li>
<li>Want to handle late arriving data</li>
</ol>
<p>Materialize is doing a good job with 1-3 already. </p>
<p>I think differential dataflow actually can handle 4, since it can handle bitemporal timestamps, but this isn't something that has been well tested or advertised. That might be worth experimenting with. UPDATE: Frank McSherry posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WijjN0LiZ4">video demo</a>.</p>
<p>All of the people in group 2 talked about typical data processing tasks, but people in group 3 had a much wider range of tasks including large-scale code analysis and monitoring systems with strong latency/consistency requirements. </p>
<p>Group 3 includes many people who seriously evaluated DD but couldn't get past the hello world stage, but also several people who <em>are</em> using DD because nothing else can handle their requirements, but still complain that the api is difficult to use.</p>
<p>Api complaints included:</p>
<ul>
<li>where is all the state? where do all these map/reduce calls actually end up living?</li>
<li>which operators are internally stateful? how much memory will this use? how can I monitor how much memory each operator is using?</li>
<li>too many single-letter type variables with unhelpfully-named bounds</li>
<li>hard to figure out why various traits (eg Data) are not being satisfied</li>
<li>hard to know what methods are available on a collection because they're all in trait impls with complicated bounds</li>
<li>losing track of column names when everything is a tuple</li>
<li>how to feed live data in - examples all show loading static data from a file</li>
<li>how to get data out, especially how to pull results instead of pushing them</li>
<li>hard to integrate threaded workers with tokio executors</li>
<li>hard to integrate with existing tools in javascript/python/r</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like there is some demand for a DD-like tool that:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a simplified, opinionated api</li>
<li>is easy to call from other languages</li>
<li>is easy to target as a compiler backend</li>
<li>is easy to integrate into other event loops</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a very distinct niche from the kafka/spark/flink niche that materialize is targeting - somewhere along a similar dimension to sqlite vs snowflake.</p>

    <div>
<p>This is a list of C++ anti-patterns that I have seen in various codes.</p>
<!-- END_TEASER -->

<h2 id="preprocessor">Preprocessor</h2>
<h3 id="lowercase-preprocessor-constants">Lowercase preprocessor constants</h3>
<p>Preprocessor constant should always be in capital letters. Otherwise you will
get the weirdest of bugs that take hours to days to track down. Say there is
some feature that you want to switch on/off during compile time. One way to do
it would be using <code>#ifdef</code> like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>int</span> <span>make_query</span><span>(</span><span>Query</span> <span>const</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>q</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Do some query stuff here.</span>

<span>#ifdef VERIFY_RESULT</span>
    <span>// Perform some verification.</span>
<span>#endif</span>

    <span>// Some other tasks and return statement.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>When compiling, you can give the option <code>-DVERIFY_RESULT</code> and the preprocessor
will put in the verification code. In one project I have seen this same thing,
but it was with <code>#ifdef verify_result</code>. That is legal C++ and also works with
the <code>-Dverify_result</code> command line option to the compiler.</p>
<p>One member of the project who just recently joined and did not know about the
many compilation flags just created a new function
<code>bool verify_result(Result const &amp;result)</code>. The compiler did not say that the
name was not in use. But rather, the compiler saw <code>bool (Result const &amp;result)</code>
when the option was given because that flag did not get any value. GCC
complained that it did not expect the <code>(</code> there.</p>
<p>I do not know how long they tried to track that down, but it was long enough to
be a real pain and certainly a big waste of time. This would not have happened
if the preprocessor constants had been uppercase all the time.</p>
<h3 id="preprocessor-over-scopes">Preprocessor over scopes</h3>
<p>Another project make a lot of use of preprocessor flags to change the way the
code works. This in itself is not a problem. However, there are pieces of code
like this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef FLAG</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>With multiple such flags, I do not see how you can sensible reason about this
code.</p>
<h3 id="including-source-files">Including source files</h3>
<p>This was in one of the header files:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"other.cpp"</span><span></span>
</code></pre>


<p>Including source files in header files usually is just wrong. One edge case are
unity builds or template specializations. Said project just did it for no
apparent reason.</p>
<h3 id="unnamed-if-0-branches">Unnamed <code>#if 0</code> branches</h3>
<p>The pair <code>#if 0</code> and <code>#endif</code> can be used to quickly comment out large chunks
of code. Contrary to <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, they have the advantage that they can be
nested and also serve as a sort of super-comment.</p>
<p>When there are multiple of those blocks around, it becomes a bit hard to
understand why some are enabled and others are not enabled:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 1</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#if 0</span><span></span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Is the middle one the negation of the first one? Is the first and third one
actually the same; do they have to be enabled at the same time?</p>
<p>Here I like it better to introduce some named constant for that. The above
could look like the following:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifndef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>

<span>// ...</span>

<span>#ifdef POLISH_WIDGETS</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>#endif</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Then it would be easy to understand what is going on. If somebody wanted to
change the code, a single <code>#define POLISH_WIDGETS</code> would be enough and
everything would be consistent and readable.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-header-files">Standalone header files</h3>
<p>A header file should include all the other headers it needs to be compiled.
Something I have seen a couple times is this here:</p>
<p><code>f.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Notice that the type <code>MyClass</code> is not defined here. It is defined in this
header, but that is not included in <code>f.hpp</code> at all.</p>
<p>It is defined in <code>myclass.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#pragma once</span>

<span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The implementation of the function <code>f</code> is in <code>f.cpp</code>. <em>There</em> the header for
<code>MyClass</code> is included:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>"myclass.hpp"</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>"f.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>And that actually compiles because the compiler only works on the <code>.cpp</code> files.
And given the ordering of the <code>#include</code> statements, the C++ compiler sees
this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>MyClass</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span><span>:</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>member</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>

<span>void</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>MyClass</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>member</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This will work as long as that header <code>f.hpp</code> is always included after
<code>myclass.hpp</code>. It will start to fail when you use <code>f.hpp</code> somewhere else. There
should be an <code>#include "myclass.hpp"</code> in <code>f.hpp</code>.</p>

<p>The order of the header files in <code>f.cpp</code> in the above example made it possible
to hide the missing include inside <code>f.hpp</code> such that it still compiles. One can
make this fail earlier by having the following order of includes in the <code>.cpp</code>
files:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Own" header file, for <code>X.cpp</code> that would be <code>X.hpp</code>
</li>
<li>Project header files</li>
<li>Third-party library headers</li>
<li>Standard library Headers</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, missing include statements in the header will become directly
apparent. You might find a bug in a third-party library this way.</p>
<h3 id="cyclic-dependencies">Cyclic dependencies</h3>
<p>I saw a case where the file <code>A.hpp</code> provides the classes <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. The
file <code>B.hpp</code> provided <code>B1</code>. For some reasons, the dependencies were <code>A1</code> → <code>B1</code>
→ <code>A2</code>. That is not directly a cyclic dependency of the types but of the header
files. This was "solved" in the project like this in file <code>A.hpp</code>:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>A1</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>

<span>#include</span> <span>"B.hpp"</span><span></span>

<span>class</span> <span>A2</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>};</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Sure, that compiled just fine. But again, header <code>B.hpp</code> is not a standalone
header and can only be used in this sandwich. I have resolved this by creating
the files <code>A1.hpp</code> and <code>A2.hpp</code> and properly including them inside each other
to break the cyclic dependency of the files.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-up-system-and-local-headers">Mixing up system and local headers</h3>
<p>There are two distinct include paths, the one that gets searched when you use
<code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code> and another for <code>#include "…"</code>. The former is for system and
third-party library headers that are installed globally. You can add to that
path using <code>-I</code>. The latter is for your project and can be amended with <code>-i</code>.
One should not mix the two and use <code>-I.</code> in order to include the local headers
with <code>#include &lt;…&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>One can argue about the usage of <code>using namespace</code>. In most cases I will not
use it to keep the global namespace somewhat clean. Using
<code>using namespace std;</code> in a <code>.cpp</code> file is okay because the namespace <code>std</code> is
just dumped out in a single compilation unit. I do not have to worry about it
in other files.</p>
<p>It becomes a totally different story once you put that <code>using namespace std;</code>
into a header file. Then every other header or source file that includes it
will have that namespace dumped out. Even other projects using that library
will suffer from the attempt to save some typing of the library programming.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files-with-same-include-guard">Multiple files with same include guard</h3>
<p>I do not like the <code>#ifndef X</code>, <code>#define X</code>, <code>#endif</code> style include guards
because they are so error prone. They are hard to read but even worse, one can
choose the same include guard twice in a project. One could even have the same
include guard that some other library already has used.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the errors will be painfully subtle. Depending on the
order if inclusion, the last header file will just not be included. Then you
get errors about undefined types and undefined functions and might pull out
your hair before you realize what is going on.</p>
<p><code>#pragma once</code> is a good alternative except if you are working with IBM XL 12.
But that compiler cannot do C++11, so it is not that interesting for me anyway.</p>
<h3 id="include-guards-do-not-match-the-filename">Include guards do not match the filename</h3>
<p>If you have <code>#ifndef FOO_H</code> in <code>bar.h</code>, bad things will happen when you create
another <code>foo.h</code>. Therefore the include guard should always be derived from the
path, or use <code>#pragma once</code>.</p>

<p>Using C functions in C++ might be a reasonable thing to do. If you do that, do
not include <code>X.h</code> but rather <code>cX</code>. So instead of <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> use <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>.
This way the C functions will be properly in the <code>std</code> namespace.</p>
<p>Functions like <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>atoi</code>, <code>fopen</code>, <code>malloc</code>, and a bunch of
others should not be used in C++. There are so much better ways.</p>
<h3 id="include-inside-namespaces">
<code>include</code> inside namespaces</h3>
<p>For reason unknown to me, there are a few includes of standard library headers
inside of namespaces. The only reason I can think of is that writing <code>::std::</code>
instead of <code>std::</code> seemed too much work.</p>
<p>GCC 6.0 has changed the standard headers such that they do not work when you
include them inside a namespace. This way one can catch this anti-pattern.</p>
<h2 id="correctness">Correctness</h2>
<h3 id="null-0-and-nullptr">
<code>NULL</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>nullptr</code>
</h3>
<p>In C++ (and C) there are 64-bit unsigned integer number (<code>uint64_t</code> or
<em>perhaps</em> <code>unsigned long</code>) and pointers (<code>void *</code>). In the machine, they are
exactly the same thing, 64-bit unsigned integer numbers. For the type system,
it still makes a great difference.</p>
<p>Although they are both just numbers to the computer, one should help the
programmers read the source code and write</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This way, it is clear that one is number-zero and the other is pointer-null.
The preprocessor constant <code>NULL</code> is just <code>0</code> or <code>0u</code>, so the compiler always
sees a plain 0 there. Still it is helpful for the programmer to read. In C++11
there even is <code>nullptr</code> which has the correct type, <code>nullptr_t</code>.</p>
<p>In some code you see horrible things like these:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint64_t</span> <span>number</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>pointer</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<h3 id="casting-pointers-to-integers">Casting pointers to integers</h3>
<p>For some reason in one project, pointers are casted to integers. And they are
converted to a special type of integer that you have to choose as a flag to
<code>configure</code> such that the length of that integer is the exact same as the
pointer length, otherwise the compiler would give you an error.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why one would do this sort of brittle code.</p>
<h3 id="subtle-dependence-on-operator-precedence">Subtle dependence on operator precedence</h3>
<p>What is the value of <code>x</code>?</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>I would read it as $2^3 - 1$ and that is seven. The value actually is four.
When compiling with Clang, it conveniently says this:</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>precedence.cpp:7:25: warning: operator '&lt;&lt;' has lower precedence than '-'; '-' will be evaluated first</span>
<span>      [-Wshift-op-parentheses]</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                   ~~ ~~^~~</span>
<span>precedence.cpp:7:25: note: place parentheses around the '-' expression to silence this warning</span>
<span>    uint32_t x = 1 &lt;&lt; 3 - 1;</span>
<span>                        ^</span>
<span>                      (    )</span>
</code></pre>


<p>What did the original author of that line really mean? Was he aware that the
<code>-</code> operation binds stronger than <code>&lt;&lt;</code>? Can I trust that code without
completely understand where all those magic numbers come from?</p>
<h3 id="not-using-raii">Not …</h3></div></div></div>
