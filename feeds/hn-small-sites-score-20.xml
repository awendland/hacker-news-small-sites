    <p>
      A frequently occurring idea for IP tunneling applications is to
      run a protocol like PPP, which encapsulates IP packets in a
      format suited for a stream transport (like a modem line), over a
      TCP-based connection. This would be an easy solution for
      encrypting tunnels by running <em>PPP over SSH</em>, for which
      several recommendations already exist (one in the Linux HOWTO
      base, one on my own website, and surely several others). It
      would also be an easy way to compress arbitrary IP traffic,
      while datagram based compression has hard to overcome efficiency
      limits.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, it doesn't work well. Long delays and frequent
      connection aborts are to be expected. Here is why.

    </p><h2>TCP's retransmission algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      TCP divides the data stream into <em>segments</em> which are
      sent as individual IP datagrams. The segments carry a
      <em>sequence number</em> which numbers the bytes in the stream,
      and an <em>acknowledge number</em> which tells the other side
      the last received sequence number. [RFC793]
    </p><p>
      Since IP datagrams may be lost, duplicated or reordered, the
      sequence numbers are used to reassemble the stream. The
      acknowledge number tells the sender, indirectly, if a segment
      was lost: when an acknowledge for a recently sent segment does
      not arrive in a certain amount of time, the sender assumes a
      lost packet and re-sends that segment.
    </p><p>
      Many other protocols using a similar approach, designed mostly
      for use over lines with relatively fixed bandwidth, have the
      "certain amount of time" fixed or configurable. In the Internet
      however, parameters like bandwidth, delay and loss rate are
      vastly different from one connection to another and even
      changing over time on a single connection. A fixed timeout in
      the seconds range would be inappropriate on a fast LAN and
      likewise inappropriate on a congested international link. In
      fact, it would increase the congestion and lead to an effect
      known as "meltdown".
    </p><p>
      For this reason, TCP uses adaptive timeouts for all
      timing-related parameters. They start at conservative estimates
      and change dynamically with every received segment. The actual
      algorithms used are described in [RFC2001]. The details are not
      important here but one critical property: <em>when a segment
      timeouts, the following timeout is increased</em>
      (exponentially, in fact, because that has been shown to avoid
      the meltdown effect).

    </p><h2>Stacking TCPs</h2>
    <p>
      The TCP timeout policy works fine in the Internet over a vast
      range of different connection characteristics. Because TCP tries
      very hard not to break connections, the timeout can increase up
      to the range of several minutes. This is just what is sensible
      for unattended bulk data transfer. (For interactive
      applications, such slow connections are of course undesirable
      and likely the user will terminate them.)
    </p><p>
      This optimization for reliability breaks when stacking one TCP
      connection on top of another, which was never anticipated by the
      TCP designers. But it happens when running PPP over SSH or
      another TCP-based protocol, because the PPP-encapsulated
      IP datagrams likely carry TCP-based payload, like this:
    </p><p>
      <img src="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.png" width="371" height="270" alt="(TCP over IP over PPP over SSH over TCP over IP)">
    </p><p>
      Note that the upper and the lower layer TCP have different
      timers. When an upper layer connection starts fast, its timers
      are fast too. Now it can happen that the lower connection has
      slower timers, perhaps as a leftover from a period with a
      slow or unreliable base connection.
    </p><p>
      Imagine what happens when, in this situation, the base
      connection starts losing packets. The lower layer TCP queues up
      a retransmission and increases its timeouts. Since the
      connection is blocked for this amount of time, the upper layer
      (i.e. payload) TCP won't get a timely ACK, and will also queue a
      retransmission. Because the timeout is still less than the lower
      layer timeout, <em>the upper layer will queue up more
      retransmissions faster than the lower layer can process
      them</em>. This makes the upper layer connection stall very
      quickly and every retransmission just adds to the problem - an
      internal meltdown effect.
    </p><p>
      TCPs reliability provisions backfire here. The upper layer
      retransmissions are completely unnecessary, since the carrier
      guarantees delivery - but the upper layer TCP can't know this,
      because TCP always assumes an unreliable carrier.

    </p><h2>Practical experience</h2>
    <p>
      The whole problem was the original incentive to start the <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/cipe.html">CIPE</a>
      project, because I used a PPP over SSH solution for some time
      and it proved to be fairly unusable. At that time it had to run
      over an optical link which suffered frequent packet loss,
      sometimes 10-20% over an extended period of time. With plain
      TCP, this was just bearable (because the link was not
      congested), but with the stacked protocols, connections would
      get really slow and then break very frequently.

    </p><p>
      This is the detailed reason why CIPE uses a datagram carrier.
      (The choice for UDP, instead of another IP-level protocol like
      IPsec does, is for several reasons: this allows to distinguish
      tunnels by their port number, and it adds the ability to run
      over SOCKS.) The datagram carrier has exactly the same
      characteristics as plain IP, for which TCP was designed to run
      over.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this article I discuss a general process I used recently to migrate a large multi-terabyte Heroku Postgres Database from the Heroku Platform to Amazon Aurora Postgres on a live Heroku based application architecture with near zero downtime and builtin failovers during the process. Not only did this migration save significant costs associated with running a large managed Postgres instance it also resulted in increased scalability and flexibility of parameter turing and other management abilities afforded by AWS RDS.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecodinginterface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blogposts/heroku-postgres-migration/Heroku-Postgres-Migration.jpg" alt="Heroku Migration Diagram" width="991" height="733"></p>
<p>The Heroku Postgres Migration to AWS Aurora Postgres Architecture and Process Flow diagram above shows, at a high level, the Heroku Postgres Data Layer Architecture for a typical Heroku Premium Level Service with High Availability plus a Read Replica for load balancing Read heavy apps. Then on the right is the migration target goal within the AWS platform boundary annotated with the sequence of steps used to migrate the data to the Aurora Postgres instance.</p>
<p>Before I get into discussing the constraints that I've experienced I would like to put forth an important disclaimer. The Heroku platform is a phenominally innovative service that has paved the way for developing countless extremely useful and profitable apps and services by lowering the barrier to entry for small development teams. Many, if not most, apps will not hit the constraints that I point out below alleviating the need for a migration of their data layer off the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroku can be costly, perhaps for good reasons, because they alleviate much of the sysops / devops investment and dev time costs of maintaining and scaling services like Postgres</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres locks down the majority of the Postgres parameters that are often necessary to tune for large enterprise level, high throughput, Postgres usage</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres monitoring falls well short of many of the other options, particularly AWS RDS, which becomes very important for large enterprise grade applications</li>
<li>Heroku Postgres does not allow Postgres superuser or Replication User roles so migration options become limited</li>
<li>Postgres pg_dump / pg_restore is not a viable option for large databases of a terabyte and up because of the amount of time it requires to run and thus inherently implies down time or data loss if used as an option for failover or migration which isn't possible for most applications</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="rando-numba-demo-app"></a>The RandoNumba Demo App</h3>
<p>To faciltate this discussion I've provided a toy app that is deployable to Heroku and built using the Django web framework which simply generates random numbers and scrapes quotes from the web.</p>
<p>1) Clone dj-randonumba-heroku app from my GitHub repo</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/amcquistan/dj-randonumba-heroku.git
cd dj-randonumba-heroku
</code></pre>
<p>2) Create a Heroku App</p>
<pre><code>heroku create</code></pre>
<p>giving the following output but, note you're output will give a different app name and url</p>
<pre><code>Creating app... done, ⬢ intense-headland-79519
https://intense-headland-79519.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/intense-headland-79519.git</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to update `randonumba.settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the host that Heroku provides.</p>
<p>3) Push the App Code to Heroku</p>
<pre><code>git push heroku master</code></pre>
<p>4) Attach a free tier Heroku Postgres Add on for Demo Purposes</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>Use psql to create the hstore Postgres extension this demo app uses</p>
<pre><code>heroku pg:psql -a intense-headland-79519
create extension hstore;
\q</code></pre>
<p>then run migrations</p>
<pre><code>heroku run python manage.py migrate -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>5) Register and Play with the App</p>
<p>Open the app in your default browser with the following (replace -a intense-headland-79519 with your app name).</p>
<pre><code>heroku open -a intense-headland-79519</code></pre>
<p>Then register the app and generate some randomness</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodinginterface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blogposts/heroku-postgres-migration/rando-numba-randomness.png" alt="" width="1838" height="948"></p>

<h3><a id="mimicing-heroku-postgres"></a>Mimicking the Heroku Postgres Service</h3>
<p>In the Real World for this process to work you need to request for the Heroku Data Support team to establish continuous WAL log shipping to an AWS S3 bucket along with a base physical backup using the <a title="WAL-E Python based library" href="https://github.com/wal-e/wal-e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAL-E Python based library</a>. Rather than bothering Heroku's Data Support team for this demo and to allow readers to fully reproduce the demo I will simply mimick this step with my own AWS EC2 instance running Postgres 11 and shipping a continuous archive to my own AWS S3 bucket.</p>
<h4>Infrastructure Specs and Services</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux 2 AMI</li>
<li>Security Group Allowing port 5432 and SSH access</li>
<li>Separate EBS Volume for Installing the Postgres DB Cluster</li>
<li>S3 Bucket for Pushing Base Physical Backup and WAL</li>
<li>IAM User with Programmatic Access to S3</li>
</ul>
<h4>Procedure for Mimicking Heroku Postgres</h4>
<p>1) Update VPS (Virtual Private Server) and Install Dependencies</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install postgresql11 -y
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib python3 lzop pv -y
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo python3 get-pip.py
sudo python3 -m pip install envdir wal-e[aws]</code></pre>
<p>2) Mount Volume and Create File System for Postgres Cluster</p>
<p>Use lsblk to identify the EBS volume to install Postgres Cluster on</p>
<pre><code>$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
xvdb    202:16   0  16G  0 disk</code></pre>
<p>Format volume as a XFS filesystem.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdb</code></pre>
<p>Create a mount point for the volume and mount it to the new directory.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /database
sudo mount /dev/xvdb /database</code></pre>
<p>Find the device's block id and make the mount permanent in /etc/fstab</p>
<pre><code>sudo blkid # will give you the block id </code></pre>
<p>example entry in /etc/fstab</p>
<pre><code>UUID=19ee2212-7fa0-4c9a-bcbf-cd7019d50fd6     /database   xfs    defaults,nofail   0   2</code></pre>
<p>Test the mount (no errors is the successful outcome).</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -a</code></pre>
<p>Update permissions of the /database directory for postgres.</p>
<pre><code>sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /database
sudo chmod -R 700 /database</code></pre>
<p>3) Create envdir Directory for AWS Creds used for WAL-E</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/wal-e/env
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /etc/wal-e
echo "INSERT-VALUE-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
echo "REGION-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_REGION
echo "INSERT-VALUE-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
echo "S3-BUCKET-FOLDER-URL-HERE" &gt; /etc/wal-e/env/WALE_S3_PREFIX
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /etc/wal-e
sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/wal-e/env</code></pre>
<p>4) Initialize Postgres Cluster</p>
<p>Run as postgres user.</p>
<pre><code>pg_ctl init -D /database</code></pre>
<p>5) Modify Postgres Configs</p>
<p>First modify /database/postgresql.conf with the following.</p>
<pre><code>listen_addresses = '*' or your apps specific IP
wal_level = replica
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e wal-push %p'
archive_timeout = 60</code></pre>
<p>Update /database/pg_hba.conf for auth (substiture 0.0.0.0/0 with your APPs IP as necessary).</p>
<pre><code>host    pgdb            pguser          0.0.0.0/0               md5</code></pre>
<p>6) Start and Enable Postgres Service</p>
<p>First create a systemd service file for managing the postgresql service in /etc/systemd/system/postgresql.service</p>
<pre><code>.include /lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service

[Service]
Environment=PGDATA=/database
</code></pre>
<p>Reload systemd, start and enable postgresql service</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql</code></pre>
<p>7) Create App Postgres User and Database</p>
<pre><code>createuser -e -l --pwprompt pguser
createdb -e --owner=pguser pgdb</code></pre>
<p>Make hstore extension</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgdb
create extension hstore;
\q</code></pre>
<p>8) Detach Heroku Postgres Addon and Switch Connection String to EC2 Instance</p>
<p>Note that this is ran locally not on the Amazon EC2 VPS</p>
<p>List addons to get name of Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons</code></pre>
<p>Detach the addon for Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku addons:detach name-of-addon -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>Replace the DATABASE_URL config variable to point to the newly spun up EC2 Postgres instance mimicking Heroku Postgres</p>
<pre><code>heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=postgres://pguser:develop3r@ec2-ip-address:5432/pgdb -a name-of-heroku-app
heroku ps:restart -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>Run migrations.</p>
<pre><code>heroku run python manage.py migrate -a name-of-heroku-app</code></pre>
<p>At this point you'll want to register a new user and generate some more test data to migrate. You could also use pg_dump / pg_restore to transfer any existing data from Heroku Postgres to this new EC2 Postgres instance being used to mimic Heroku Postgres</p>
<p><br>9) Push Base Backup to S3 Using WAL-E</p>
<p>Note that tests next commands are to be ran on the Amazon Linux VPS.</p>
<p>As a personal preference I like to wrap potentially long running commands in shell scripts so I can explicitly echo out when things begin and end then to protect against SSH connections from timing out during potentially long running processes I use nohup with backgrounding.</p>
<p>For this I create the following script</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /var/lib/pgsql/scripts &amp;&amp; cd /var/lib/pgsql/scripts
vi wal-e-push-backup.sh</code></pre>
<p>with contents</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "starting wal-e backup-push"

envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e backup-push /database

echo "wal-e backup-push complete"
</code></pre>
<p>Run it.</p>
<pre><code>nohup ./wal-e-push-backup.sh &amp;</code></pre>
<p>After the push finishes I should be able to verify that the backup has been pushed with the following command.</p>
<pre><code>envdir /etc/wal-e/env wal-e backup-list</code></pre>
<p>At this point I have an EC2 Instance with Postgres installed mimicking Heroku Postgres and continuously shipping backups and WAL to S3.</p>
<h3><a id="log-shipped-replica"></a>Restore and Promote EC2 Postgres Log Shipped Replica</h3>
<p>In the real world this is where you will start, that is by creating your log shipped replica loaded from data in S3 in the form of a physical base backup and WAL files. The Heroku Data Support team will likely provide you with S3 creds for WAL-E in the form of Heroku config variables which you can …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Charles proxy is an HTTP debugging proxy that can inspect network calls and debug SSL traffic. With Charles, you are able to inspect requests/responses, headers and cookies. Today we will see how to set up Charles, and how we can use Charles proxy for web scraping. We will focus on extracting data from Javascript-heavy web pages and mobile applications. Charles sits between your applications and the internet:</p>

<p>Charles is like the Chrome dev tools on steroids. It has many incredible features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth throttling to emulate slow internet connection</li>
<li>Request editing (the test the behavior of a back-end API for example)</li>
<li>Repeat requests</li>
<li>Full-text search on a list of request (very interesting for web-scraping)</li>
<li>Many more</li>
</ul>
<p>Charles is a very interesting tool when debugging Single Page application or mobile applications.</p>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup">Installation and set-up</h2>
<p>We are going to see how to install and configure Charles on macOS, but there is also a Windows and Linux version.</p>
<p>First visit <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/">https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/</a> and download Charles.</p>

<p>After clicking on Install Root Certificate, it will open your macOS Keychain Access, and you will have to open the Trust menu and click on “Always trust”.</p>
<p>This will ask you for your system password.</p>
<p>Now you will need to go to Proxy &gt; SSL Proxying Settings and add “*” or the domain you want to inspect SSL on.</p>

<p>Charles will now capture the HTTPS traffic on the domain you've selected.</p>
<h2 id="finding-hidden-apis-on-single-page-applications">Finding hidden APIs on Single Page Applications</h2>
<p>In a traditional <em><strong>server-side</strong></em> rendered website, the HTML code is built by the backend service, and the full page is returned to the HTTP client (generally your browser).
Over the past 10 years, more and more websites are rendered <em><strong>client-side</strong></em> using a Single Page Application framework like React.js, Vue.js or Angular.</p>
<p>Those framework are sending many requests to a back-end API, and it can be a great idea to consume those APIs directly instead of scraping the site and rendering the Javascript with a headless browser to extract the data you want. It will be much faster, you don't need expensive hardware (headless browser needs a lot of RAM and powerful CPUs.).</p>
<p>We are going to look at different Single Page Application to see how Charles proxy can help you discover and extract data from back-end APIs.</p>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a></p>
<p>ProductHunt is a famous website to launch products online. It's very popular in the tech ecosystem. There are dozens of projects launched every day, so the front page only loads the products of the day. There is an infinite scroll to look at previous days products.</p>
<p>We are going to use Charles proxy to analyze the backend API call and reproduce it with some Python code.</p>
<p>Now open Charles proxy and go to the Producthunt home page, scroll several times to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>By default, Charles will capture every HTTP request made by your system, not only your browser. So you will get a lot of “pollution”. You can filter that by entering the domain you're interested in:</p>

<p>There are many things going on with these requests, but if you compare the content being sent to the GraphQL API, it seems the only thing that changes is the <code>cursor</code> parameter.</p>
<p>It is base64 encoded, but luckily, Charles has a feature to quickly decode Base64 content. You just have to select it and right-click:</p>

  <p><img loading="lazy" srcset="
      
      
      " src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6734761222929a603852e3310a4248ce09d7ece/f5dc1/blog/charles-proxy/base64decode.png" width="433" height="470" alt="Sequence of request in Charles proxy, from ProductHunt home page" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6734761222929a603852e3310a4248ce09d7ece/f5dc1/blog/charles-proxy/base64decode.png">
  
</p></div>




<p>One of the killer features Charles offers is the ability to edit any request and replay. In our case it's really great because there are many headers/cookies values inside the request, so it would be a nightmare to try to reproduce the request with an HTTP client or inside your code.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you can right-click on the request and click on Compose.</p>

<p>You can then play with the <code>cursor</code> value and replace it with a different page number encoded in base64. Then click on Execute.</p>
<p>You can also try deleting the different cookies (it will work). It's great news because if cookies were mandatory to use this endpoint, it would have been more complicated to reproduce the request with our Python code.</p>
<p>Now you can export the request to cURL:</p>






















<div>
  
  <p><img loading="lazy" srcset="
      
      
      " src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d4650e428f9936b26cd8a6cff8e4fc9a50af9f72/76968/blog/charles-proxy/export_curl.png" width="665" height="496" alt="Compose request Charles proxy" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d4650e428f9936b26cd8a6cff8e4fc9a50af9f72/76968/blog/charles-proxy/export_curl.png">
  
</p></div>




<p>Then you can use a tool like this one to convert the cURL command to Python code (using the wonderful Requests package): <a href="https://curl.trillworks.com/"></a><a href="https://curl.trillworks.com/">https://curl.trillworks.com/</a></p>
<p>I just added the <code>verify=False</code> parameter to avoid SSL warnings with Requests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In July, we announced the early access of the Koyeb platform to help developers and businesses run serverless data-processing apps in minutes. Since then, we have received a lot of feedback and have been at work improving the product.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the public availability of the <strong>Koyeb Serverless Engine</strong> with our latest features to <strong>deploy your own code</strong>. In addition to the ready-to-use integrations, you can now seamlessly deploy <strong><a href="#native-support-of-docker-containers">Docker Containers</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#continuous-deployment-of-python-and-nodejs-functions-using-git">Code Functions with built-in Continuous Deployment using Git</a>.</strong></p><p>This release brings the power of the Koyeb Serverless Engine to all developers and businesses with <strong><a href="#event-driven-processing">event-driven processing</a>, <a href="#serverless-autoscaling-and-high-availability">native autoscaling</a>,</strong> and <strong>a complete secret management engine.</strong> The Koyeb platform provides strong primitives for data-processing with our <strong><a href="#object-storage-api-and-data-processing">Universal S3-Compliant Object Storage API</a></strong> and <strong>ready-to-use integrations</strong>. We're also happy to share that <strong><a href="#new-open-source-catalog">our catalog is now open-source</a></strong>.</p><p>The Koyeb platform offers an efficient solution to deploy your serverless applications. It is the best platform to <strong>deploy short and long-running background processing tasks with no time limit for the execution of your jobs</strong>. Common use-cases are:</p><ul><li><em>Media processing</em>: transforming images, videos, audio recordings or PDFs directly at upload</li><li><em>Web scraping and headless browser requests</em>: fetching data from and interacting with websites which do not have any API</li><li><em>Interfacing with slow or asynchronous APIs</em>: calling slow APIs or APIs using callbacks</li><li><em>Asynchronous Computer Vision and Inference</em>: automatic content detection in photos and videos for indexing, metadata enrichment or advanced anlysis</li><li><em>Batch processing</em>: running heavy computations on batches of database records or media</li><li><em>Data science and report generation</em>: analysing data and generating pre-computed reports</li><li><em>Notification reception and processing from IoT devices</em>: reacting to events generated by devices and triggering actions</li><li><em>DevOps</em>: backup, monitoring, build and deployment jobs</li><li>And much more!</li></ul><p><strong>We're happy to provide 1000 hours of compute, 1TB of storage, and 5TB of bandwidth per month for free until the end of the year.</strong>  All the function executions are currently powered by <strong>1GB of RAM and 1 vCPU</strong>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup"><strong>Sign up now</strong></a> and start deploying serverless functions!</p><p>One of the recurring requests we got was the ability to <strong>deploy your own code on Koyeb</strong>. We get it: you need to be able to inject your business logic and pair it with our ready-to-use integrations to build your application faster and better.</p><p>When looking for an efficient way to let you manage your stack functions and modifications, we decided to go with the best-practice for code and infrastructure management: <strong>version everything</strong>. We're glad to share that this new release brings a <strong>native integration with git and GitHub</strong> to seamlessly integrate Koyeb with your development workflows.</p><p>Integrating Koyeb in your development environment is a two-step process:</p><ol start="1"><li>Add a <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span> file in your repository describing your stack configuration. Stacks can now be deployed with a simple YAML syntax which should look familiar.
For instance, to deploy a Python 3.8 function with the <span><code><span>handler</span></code></span> entrypoint in the <span><code><span>hello_world</span></code></span> package, your <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span> will look like:</li></ol><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: hello-world
<span>3</span>    runtime: python3.8
<span>4</span>    handler: hello_world.handler
</code></pre><p>Fork our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/koyeb-community/hello-world-python">Hello World in Python on GitHub</a> to see a simple example in action. You can deploy Python and Node.js functions with the same syntax.</p><ol start="2"><li>Connect your GitHub repository to Koyeb.</li></ol><p>Now each time you <span><code><span>git push</span></code></span>, we will build and deploy your code!</p><p>For Python and Node.js functions, we take care of the complete build process using standard dependency management tools. If you want to read more about deploying code functions, check our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/deploy-python-function">Python function</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/deploy-nodejs-function">Node.js function</a> documentation.</p><p>After looking into the serverless space, we found that serverless solutions were fragmented into two separate generations of products to solve the same problem: containers and code functions. Our research shows that a lot of developers and companies try to use code functions but end up migrating to a container service due to runtime limitations.</p><p>We want you to be able to process your data with the technology you know and love, so we decided to provide <strong>a unified solution to deploy your applications</strong>.</p><p><strong>Containers can be deployed with the same simple YAML syntax as functions.</strong>
For instance, to deploy the <span><code><span>koyeb/cowsay</span></code></span> container from the Docker Hub, you simply need three lines of configuration:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: hello-koyeb
<span>3</span>    image: koyeb/cowsay
</code></pre><p>The Koyeb Stacks work in a unified way for containers and code functions. The deployment of containers also integrates with git and lets you benefit from native versioning.</p><p>The Koyeb Serverless Engine is completely event-driven, allowing seamless integration with various sources and native autoscaling. The platform not only provides strong integration with events coming from our Object Storage gateway, it also lets you invoke your functions using events respecting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvent specification</a>.</p><p>The event system is designed to be powerful with <strong>easy filtering of incoming events using the Common Expression Language</strong>. Here is a simple example, triggering a container dumping the incoming event with <span><code><span>jq</span></code></span> each time an event is received on the Koyeb Object Storage gateway:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: display-koyeb-event
<span>3</span>    image: stedolan/jq
<span>4</span>    args: [".", "/koyeb/events/in/raw"]
<span>5</span>    events:
<span>6</span>      - cloudevent:
<span>7</span>          expression: event.source == "koyeb.com/gateway"
</code></pre><p>One of the most challenging parts of serverless technologies is troubleshooting. We decided to provide <strong>essential observability features and event tracing as part of the core platform</strong>. All stacks have an audit log with all the events received and which function they triggered. The event content is highly accessible, so you can easily understand your functions' executions and failures.</p><p>As events are the foundation of our connected world, we're exploring use-cases in the IoT space. If you want to talk about events or IoT, please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/contact">contact us</a>!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.koyeb.com/docs/stacks/quickstart/bind-store-events">Read more about events in our documentation</a>.</p><p>As part of the Koyeb Platform, we provide an S3-Compliant Object Storage API to store your data. You can use a Koyeb Managed Store or connect your own account cloud service provider. We're happy to share that we already support major cloud service providers including <strong>GCP Storage and AWS S3</strong>.</p><p>We also have an impressive list of cloud service providers in preview: <strong>Azure Blob, Wasabi Storage, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces, StackPath Object Storage, and Scaleway Object Storage</strong>.</p><p><strong>Our Serverless Compute Engine is designed to seamlessly integrate with our Object Storage API</strong>. You can easily interact with your Stores from your Koyeb Stack functions and access your data with no effort.</p><p>When you do so, each function execution will get <strong>short-lived credentials</strong> in the environment to access your data store and <strong>prevent credentials leakage</strong>.</p><p>Here is an example of a function using the stores with our secret management engine to fetch the content of an object. The object to fetch and bucket location are automatically provided in the incoming event:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>import boto3
</span><span>2</span>import os
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>def handler(event, context):
<span>5</span>        obj_name = event["object"]["key"]
<span>6</span>        store_name = event["bucket"]["name"]
<span>7</span>        boto_session = boto3.Session(region_name=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_REGION"])
<span>8</span>    store_client = boto_session.resource(
<span>9</span>        "s3",
<span>10</span>        aws_access_key_id=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_ACCESS_KEY"],
<span>11</span>        aws_secret_access_key=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_SECRET_KEY"],
<span>12</span>        endpoint_url=os.environ[f"KOYEB_STORE_{store_name}_ENDPOINT"],
<span>13</span>    )
<span>14</span>    obj = store_client.Object(obj_key).get()
<span>15</span>    content = obj["Body"].read()
<span>16</span>    # Add your own processing logic!
</code></pre><p>Our S3-Compliant object storage API can now also be used as a <strong>standalone solution to benefit from a unified API wherever your data is stored</strong>.</p><p>One of the core benefits of the Koyeb serverless engine is that <strong>autoscaling and high-availability are provided by design</strong>.</p><p>On the availability side, you don't need to worry about dealing with failures of the underlying infrastructure, we take care of <strong>automatically provisioning your functions on a new server in case of a failure</strong>.</p><p>On the scaling side, we <strong>automatically increase the number of containers according to the number of incoming events</strong>. Free accounts have a default scaling limit at 10 to prevent abuse, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.koyeb.com/support">contact us</a> if you need to scale more!</p><p>Our function catalog has been completely refreshed with <strong>ready-to-use integrations which are now completely open-source</strong>: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://github.com/koyeb-community">github.com/koyeb-community</a>.</p><p>It's easy to combine ready-to-use functions with your own code in Stacks. For instance, to to use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://koyeb.com/catalog/function/image-resize">image-resize function from the catalog</a>, simply add to your <span><code><span>koyeb.yaml</span></code></span>:</p><pre><code><span>1</span><span>functions:
</span><span>2</span>  - name: image-resize
<span>3</span>    use: image-resize@1.0.0
<span>4</span>    with:
<span>5</span>      STORE: your-store
<span>6</span>      IMAGE_RESIZE_WIDTH: 150

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><br>
Today Netlify has emerged as the modern platform for rapidly building web applications without having to worry about anything beyond your code. We at <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>
are users of Netlify and have bought into this phenomenal experience. What’s more Netlify has demonstrated to us a breakdown in the classic web architecture 
stack which previously combined web and api concerns in a single place. As we moved through a tiered architecture frontend had not been given anything more 
than hints on how to consume dynamic content from the backend. Today we’re all calling this the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jamstack">Jamstack</h2>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b7d16f7f3654fb8572360301e60d76df254a323e/385ec/img/svg/architecture.svg"></p>
<center><i><small>Credit jamstack.org</small></i></center>
<p><br>
The jamstack rethinks the frontend architecture by separating the concerns of static and dynamic content and pushing for the dynamic side to be consumed 
through APIs and services. Effectively, Netlify embracing this model has tried to build microservices for the frontend and moved towards a unification 
of consumption of services via APIs on the backend. It’s clear this is the architecture of the future for the web and the majority of cloud services 
will be built and consumed soley as APIs.</p>

<p>The one question we’ve really been seeing a lot though is “What’s Netlify for the backend?”. Many of those frontend users building Jamstack apps on 
Netlify are looking to where they can find and build these APIs. It seems even Netlify’s current answer has been, “go host something on heroku”. I think 
in 2020 this just doesn’t fly. If the frontend is being reimagined then the same has to happen on the backend to cater for that use.</p>

<h2 id="netlify-for-the-backend">Netlify for the Backend</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/netlify.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://m3o.com/"><strong>M3O</strong></a> is a platform for cloud services development. The fastest way to build APIs without managing the infrastructure. M3O makes use of 
<a href="https://micro.mu/"><strong>Micro</strong></a>, an open source platform for microservices development. What we get from Micro is a powerful framework for building, running 
and consuming APIs as microservices. What M3O brings to the table is Micro as a Service, a fully managed platform for building microservices. Write services 
in Go and gRPC on the backend, expose them dynamically via HTTP API to be consumed by the frontend. M3O looks to fill that gap in the market for frontend 
devs. M3O is Netlify for the backend.</p>

<h2 id="m3o-features">M3O Features</h2>

<p>As we mentioned, M3O is a fully managed <a href="https://micro.mu/">Micro</a> services platform. What does that mean? Micro provides the building blocks for 
writing, running and consuming microservices. From source to running and beyond. M3O takes that and hosts it so you can just get on with writing 
APIs without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</p>

<p>Here’s a few of the key features and services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Microservices development</strong> using <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> and protobuf code generation</li>
  <li><strong>Service runtime</strong> and process lifecycle management</li>
  <li><strong>Source to running</strong> builds without need for CI/CD</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication and authorization</strong> for access control and user management</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic configuration</strong> and secrets management</li>
  <li><strong>PubSub messaging</strong> and event streaming</li>
  <li><strong>Service discovery</strong> and secure networking</li>
  <li><strong>Key-value storage</strong> and persistent CRUD</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic HTTP routing</strong> with path based resolution</li>
  <li><strong>Identity aware proxy</strong> for remote access and gRPC-web apps</li>
  <li><strong>Public API gateway</strong> and TLS support by default</li>
  <li><strong>Public and private repos</strong> support including  github, gitlab and bitbucket</li>
</ul>

<p>M3O is a feature complete platform for microservices development from generating service templates on your local machine through to writing and running 
it in the cloud all using the same Micro CLI experience. M3O exposes HTTPS urls for you dynamically by default. So every service automatically becomes 
an API as soon as you deploy it.</p>

<p>Where a new development model has emerged for the frontend, we think its dictating the “headless” paradigm shift for the backend and M3O wants to be there 
to host all of those APIs as Micro services.</p>

<h2 id="api-first">API First</h2>

<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0znow24kgpu2dp3zg60n.png"></p>

<p>We are seeing the emergence of APIs as the dominant form factor for cloud services, from AWS all the way through to Twilio and Stripe. What’s even more 
compelling is while this model has emerged in the past few years, we are only really just getting started. It’s our belief that in a decade from now 
some of the most important companies will be API first yet strangely there is no platform to caters to this form of development.</p>

<p>Twilio, Stripe and others have all had to build out the infrastructure for their API first approach. We think as many more companies go down this path 
the tools must emerge to empower them, not just at the compute layer but by providing the higher level abstractions required. That’s the goal of M3O.</p>

<p>But don’t just take our word for it. We’re going to walk you through a demonstration of the value proposition so you can see for yourself just how 
powerful Micro and M3O are.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-backend">Building a backend</h2>

<p>You’re going to be writing and deploying APIs in minutes rather than hours or days! No more dealing with infrastructure on the 
backend, just as Netlify empowered devs on the frontend, we’re doing the same for a new generation of developers on the backend.</p>

<p>Let’s walk you through it. We’ll deploy an existing Micro blog service with this demo frontend on Netlify: <a href="https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/">https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/</a>. But first let’s start with signup.</p>

<h3 id="signup-to-m3o">Signup to M3O</h3>

<p>First you start by signing up to M3O and registering for a free account in our Dev environment.</p>

<p>Start by installing micro</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-fsSL</span> https://install.m3o.com/micro | /bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For those wary of curl into bash, you can view it first <a href="https://install.m3o.com/micro">https://install.m3o.com/micro</a>.</p>

<p>Signup is purely CLI based for now so just issue the following command and follow the steps</p>



<p>Once you’re done you should have an account on M3O and be automatically logged in.</p>

<h3 id="run-helloworld">Run Helloworld</h3>

<p>Validate that by running helloworld.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check it’s running and try call it via the CLI.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># check the status</span>
micro status

<span># call helloworld</span>
micro call helloworld <span>--name</span><span>=</span><span>"Alice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK now we get to the more interesting part. Call it via the HTTP API that’s dynamically generated for you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># get your namespace</span>
<span>NAMESPACE</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>micro user namespace<span>)</span>

<span># curl your unique url</span>
curl <span>"https://</span><span>$NAMESPACE</span><span>.m3o.com/helloworld?name=Alice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If alls good, we can move on to running something a bit more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="deploying-a-dynamic-blog-backend">Deploying a dynamic blog backend</h3>

<p>We’re going to deploy a headless CMS, or better known as a Blog API.</p>

<p>On the open source side, Micro maintains some reusable example services we can all play with and contribute back to. 
You can check them out at <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a>. Let’s bootstrap the blog 
using a couple of them.</p>

<p>Because Micro is all about microservices development, we’ve decomposed the blog API into posts, comments and tags. 
Right now we’ll focus on posts and tags. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/micro/services/tree/master/blog">https://github.com/micro/services/tree/master/blog</a>.</p>

<p>Deploying these is super simple.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># run the posts service</span>
micro run github.com/micro/services/blog/posts

<span># run the tags service</span>
micro run github.com/micro/services/blog/tags
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check they’re running using <code>micro status</code>. You should see the status progress through starting, building and running. 
If you want to see logs or anything related just do <code>micro logs posts</code> and the same for any other service by name.</p>

<h3 id="write-a-post-on-the-cli">Write a post on the CLI</h3>

<p>Once services are running they become immediately callable via the CLI as dynamic commands.</p>

<p>Save a quick post:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--id</span><span>=</span>1 <span>--title</span><span>=</span><span>"My first post"</span> <span>--content</span><span>=</span><span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>List posts:</p>



<p>The same calls can be made over the API too, just have to know your namespace:</p>

<h3 id="call-it-via-the-http-api">Call it via the HTTP API</h3>

<p>Now here’s where it gets cool and more importantly what you’ll be calling from your frontend apps 
running on Netlify. First grab your namespace like earlier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro user namespace
random-example-namespace
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now just curl it like any other api</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl <span>-H</span> <span>"Micro-Namespace: random-example-namespace"</span> https://api.m3o.dev/posts/query
<span>{</span>
  <span>"posts"</span>: <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My first post"</span>,
      <span>"slug"</span>: <span>"my-first-post"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The generic <code>api.m3o.dev</code> url requires us to pass in our namespace so we query our own service but 
every namespace also gets its own unique URL so you don’t have to worry about this in your frontend 
code. Just compose namespace + m3o.dev as <code>random-example-namespace.m3o.dev</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl https://random-example-namespace.m3o.dev/posts/query
<span>{</span>
  <span>"posts"</span>: <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"1"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span>: <span>"My first post"</span>,
      <span>"slug"</span>: <span>"my-first-post"</span>,
      <span>"content"</span>: <span>"This is pretty epic"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! We now have the backend for our frontend running on M3O.</p>

<p>Let’s deploy the sample frontend to Netlify just for kicks.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-the-frontend-to-netlify">Deploying the frontend to Netlify</h2>

<p>The frontend is a simple angular app we’ve put together to validate the premise:</p>

<p><strong>Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend</strong></p>

<p>You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/m3o/blog-frontend">github.com/m3o/blog-frontend</a> but 
we’ll walk you through the install now. The deploy settings for the site hosted under 
<a href="https://loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app/">loving-goodall-44ee08.netlify.app</a> are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="build-settings">Build settings</h3>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/deploysettings.png">
</center>

<p><br>
You can copy the below settings for ease of use. Where you see ‘concert-celtic-uncover’ replace it with your namespace from <code>micro user namespace</code> on the CLI. 
We need this to know what backend API to call.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Repository        github.com/m3o/blog-frontend
Base directory    Not set
Build command     sed -i 's/micro/concert-celtic-uncover/g' ./src/environments/environment.prod.ts &amp;&amp; ng build --prod &amp;&amp; cp ./src/assets/_redirects ./dist/blog-frontend
Publish directory dist/blog-frontend
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it’s the original <code>m3o/blog-frontend</code> being deployed in the example, but in your case <code>m3o</code> will be replaced with your fork. 
This is because Netlify asks for the permissions to the repo.</p>

<p>The build command is a bit involved, here is what it’s doing:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Replace the micro namespace with your own</span>
<span>namespace</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>micro user namespace<span>)</span>

<span>sed</span> <span>-i</span> <span>"s/micro/</span><span>$namespace</span><span>/g"</span> ./src/environments/environment.prod.ts

<span># It's an angular app, so we have to ng build</span>
ng build <span>--prod</span>

<span># Single page …</span></code></pre></div></div></section></article></div></div>

During compile time Angular CLI will download and inline fonts that are being used and linked in the application. We enable this by default in apps built with version 11. All you need to do to take advantage of this optimization is update your app!</p><h2 id="124e">Component Test Harnesses</h2><p id="78d2">In Angular v9 we introduced Component Test Harnesses. They provide a robust and legible API surface to help with testing Angular Material components. It gives developers a way to interact with Angular Material components using the supported API during testing.</p><p id="2932">Releasing with version 11, we have harnesses for all of the components! Now developers can create more robust test suites.</p><p id="3e07">We’ve also included performance improvements and new APIs. The <em>parallel</em> function makes working with asynchronous actions in your tests easier by allowing developers to run multiple asynchronous interactions with components in parallel. The <em>manualChangeDetection</em> function gives developers access to finer grained control of change detection by disabling automatic change detection in unit tests.</p><p id="752c">For more details and examples of these APIs and other new features, be sure to check out the <a href="http://material.angular.io/cdk/test-harnesses/overview" rel="noopener">documentation for Angular Material</a> Test Harnesses!</p><h2 id="173a">Improved Reporting and Logging</h2><p id="968c">We’ve made changes to the builder phase reporting to make it even more helpful during development. We are bringing in new CLI output updates to make logs and reports easier to read.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Screenshot of angular CLI output nicely formatted into columns." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1214/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX" width="607" height="355" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1214/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX 607w" sizes="607px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*-dCa80651cnfbjpX?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Improved CLI output formatting</figcaption></figure><h2 id="970e">Updated Language Service Preview</h2><p id="650a">The Angular Language Service provides helpful tools to make development with Angular productive and fun. The current version of the language service is based on View Engine and today we’re giving a sneak peek of the Ivy-based language service. The updated language service provides a more powerful and accurate experience for developers.</p><p id="15e6">Now, the language service will be able to correctly infer generic types in templates the same way the TypeScript compiler does. For example, in the screenshot below we’re able to infer that the iterable is of type string.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Screenshot of intellisense style insights in Angular templates." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN" width="1500" height="902" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*L1Tg13gdu3PCqUNN?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Angular Language Service inferring iterable types in templates</figcaption></figure><p id="e67f">This powerful new update is still in development but we wanted to share an update as we keep preparing it for a full release in an upcoming version.</p><h2 id="48a5">Updated Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Support</h2><p id="303f">Angular has offered support for HMR but enabling it required configuration and code changes making it less than ideal to quickly include in Angular projects. In version 11 we’ve updated the CLI to allow enabling HMR when starting an application with ng serve. To get started, run the following command:</p><pre><span id="3ac4">ng serve --hmr</span></pre><p id="f3bc">After the local server starts the console will display a message confirming that HMR is active:</p><p id="f521">NOTICE: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled for the dev server.</p><p id="5155">See <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement" rel="noopener">https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement</a> for information on working with HMR for webpack.</p><p id="3796">Now during development the latest changes to components, templates and styles will be instantly updated into the running application. All without requiring a full page refresh. Data typed into forms are preserved as well as scroll position providing a boost to developer productivity.</p><h2 id="6de3">Faster Builds</h2><p id="630c">We’re bringing a faster development and build cycle by making updates to some key areas.</p><ul><li id="4336">When installing dependencies, the ngcc update process is now 2–4x faster.</li><li id="b30d">Faster compilation with TypeScript v4.0.</li></ul><p id="ed18">Now, teams can opt-in to webpack v5. Currently, you could experiment with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/" rel="noopener">module federation</a>. In the future, webpack v5 will clear the path for:</p><ul><li id="db89">Faster builds with persistent disk caching</li><li id="7ab4">Smaller bundles thanks to <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/" rel="noopener">cjs tree-shaking</a></li></ul><p id="dae8">Support is experimental and under development so we don’t recommend opting in for production uses.</p><p id="4ca8">Want to try out webpack 5? To enable it in your project, add the following section to your package.json file:</p><pre><span id="386c">"resolutions": {<br>     "webpack": "5.4.0"<br>}</span></pre><p id="65a0">Currently, you’ll need to use <strong>yarn</strong> to test this as npm does not yet support the resolutions property.</p><h2 id="d0a9">Linting</h2><p id="e4b2">In previous versions of Angular, we’ve shipped a default implementation for linting (TSLint). Now, TSLint is deprecated by the project creators who recommend migration to ESLint. <a href="https://twitter.com/mrjameshenry" rel="noopener">James Henry</a> together with other folks from the open-source community developed a third-party solution and migration path via <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint" rel="noopener">typescript-eslint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint" rel="noopener">angular-eslint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/tslint-to-eslint-config" rel="noopener">tslint-to-eslint-config</a>! We’ve been collaborating closely to ensure a smooth transition of Angular developers to the supported linting stack.</p><p id="6071">We’re deprecating the use of TSLint and Codelyzer in version 11. This means that in future versions the default implementation for linting Angular projects will not be available.</p><p id="806d">Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint#migrating-from-codelyzer-and-tslint" rel="noopener">official project page</a> for a guide to incorporate angular-eslint in a project and migrate from TSLint.</p><h2 id="98a6">Housekeeping</h2><p id="0727">In this update we’re removing support for IE9/IE10 and IE mobile. IE11 is the only version of IE <a href="https://angular.io/guide/browser-support" rel="noopener">still supported</a> by Angular. We’ve also <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deprecations" rel="noopener">removed deprecated APIs</a> and added a few to the deprecation list. Be sure to check this out to make sure you are using the latest APIs and following our recommended best practices.</p><h2 id="a3c7">Roadmap</h2><p id="9aad">We’ve also updated the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap" rel="noopener">roadmap</a> to keep you posted on our current priorities. Some of the announcements in this post are updates on in-progress projects from the roadmap. This reflects our approach to incrementally rollout larger efforts and allows developers to provide early feedback that we can incorporate it into the final release.</p><p id="8c07">We collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/simpulton" rel="noopener">Lukas Ruebbelke</a> from the Angular community on updating the content of some of the projects to better reflect the value they provide to developers.</p><h2 id="6939">How to update to get version 11</h2><p id="0170">When you are ready to go run this command to update Angular and CLI:</p><pre><span id="5983">ng update @angular/cli @angular/core</span></pre><p id="ac5f">Head over to <a href="https://update.angular.io/" rel="noopener">update.angular.io</a> to find detailed information and guidance on updating. We always recommend upgrading one major release at a time to have the best update experience.</p><p id="732f">We hope you enjoy this feature update and be sure to let us know what you think here or on <a href="https://twitter.com/angular" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>!</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

    <p>I booted the arm64e kernel of macOS 11.0.1 beta 1 kernel in QEMU up to launchd. It’s completely useless, but may be interesting if you’re wondering how an Apple Silicon Mac will boot.</p>

<h2 id="howto">Howto</h2>

<p>This is similar to my previous guide on running <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">iOS kernel in QEMU</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install macOS 11.0.1 beta 1 (20B5012D)</li>
  <li>run <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/build_arm64e_kcache.sh"><code>build_arm64e_kcache.sh</code></a> to create an Apple Silicon Boot Kext Collection</li>
  <li>build the modified QEMU:
    <div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu
cd qemu
git checkout a12z-macos
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu
make
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>create a modified device tree by running <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/FourthTry/DTRewriter.java">DTRewriter</a> on <a href="https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020SummerSeed/fullrestores/001-30235/6D8C0CA3-5952-4FD8-AEB3-4B4CADB626BC/iPad8,11,iPad8,12_14.0_18A5332f_Restore.ipsw">iPad Pro firmware</a>:
    <div><div><pre><code>python3 extractfilefromim4p.py Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.j421ap.im4p DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3.devicetree
java DTRewriter DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3.devicetree DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3_Modified.dtb
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>run QEMU:
    <div><div><pre><code>./aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max \
  -kernel /path/to/bootcache-arm64e \
  -dtb /path/to/DeviceTree_iPad_Pro_iOS_14.0_b3_Modified.dtb  \
  -monitor stdio -m 6G -s -S -d unimp,mmu \
  -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout \
  -append "-noprogress cs_enforcement_disable=1 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1 nvram-log=1 debug=0x8 kextlog=0xffff io=0xfff serial=0x7 cpus=1 rd=md0 apcie=0xffffffff" \
  -initrd /path/to/ios14.0b3/ramdisk.dmg $@
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>run gdb with <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/bootit.gdbscript">this script</a>:
    <div><div><pre><code>~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.0.6113669/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/gdb \
-D /any/emptydir \
-x bootit.gdbscript
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And the macOS kernel will <a href="https://gist.github.com/zhuowei/5aa668e76f387374cd56848313aa2197">boot into launchd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-useful">Is this useful?</h2>

<p><img src="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/xnuqemu3/wwdc2018_no.jpg" alt="&quot;No.&quot; - Craig Federighi, WWDC 2018"></p>

<p>No:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absolutely nothing is supported: literally only the kernel and the serial port works, not even the userspace since there’s no disk driver</li>
  <li>Userspace is instead borrowed from iOS 14 b3</li>
  <li>This will never boot anything close to graphical macOS UI</li>
  <li>Most importantly, even if I ever managed to fully boot the macOS kernel, emulating macOS is useless anyways.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are only three reasons I can think of for emulating macOS: security research, software development without a real Apple Silicon machine, and Hackintoshing. This approach will help with none of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emulating iOS is useful for security research when jailbreak is not available. Apple Silicon Macs already support kernel debugging.</li>
  <li>Not useful for software dev: QEMU’s CPU emulation doesn’t support Apple Silicon-specific features, such as Rosetta’s memory ordering or the APRR JIT.</li>
  <li>as for Hackintosh: macOS uses CPU instructions that aren’t available yet on non-Apple ARM CPUs, so you can’t have hardware accelerated virtualization, only very slow emulation. Besides, Hackintoshes are often built when Apple’s own hardware isn’t fast enough; in this case, Apple’s ARM processors are already some of the fastest in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>I researched this this not because it’ll be practical, but only to understand how an Apple Silicon Mac works. This will never be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AtE54HpXBM">Time Train</a>: only a <a href="https://youtu.be/UswpJh6Zvd8?t=119">science experiment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>

<h2 id="create-kext-collection">Create kext collection</h2>

<p>On iOS, the kernel and its Kexts are packed together into a bootable file called the <strong>Kernel Cache</strong>.</p>

<p>macOS 11 uses an evolved version of this format, called the <strong>Boot Kext Collection</strong>.</p>

<p>Like the iOS kernelcache, it contains all Kexts required for booting, so the bootloader only needs to load it into memory and jump into it.</p>

<p>To create a boot kext collection, macOS 11 introduces the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/installing_a_custom_kernel_extension?language=objc"><code>kmutil</code></a> tool.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/build_arm64e_kcache.sh">my script</a> to get <code>kmutil</code> to generate an arm64e kext collection.</p>

<p>It manually excludes some kexts because they cause kmutil to error out. Most are because they depend on ACPI, which is not available on Apple Silicon. I made a <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/printexcludekexts.sh">script</a> to detect them.</p>

<p>Debugging <code>kmutil</code> failures on macOS 11 beta 3 was easy because it dumped out the entire NSError message. However, on macOS 11.0.1 beta, Apple decided to hide the full error message and only print an error code. I had to disable SIP and put a breakpoint on <code>swift_errorRetain</code> to get at the underlying error.</p>

<p>Once the <code>build_arm64e_kcache.sh</code> runs, a Boot Kext Collection is created at <code>~/kcache_out/bootcache-arm64e</code>, which can be booted in QEMU.</p>

<h2 id="disassembling-the-boot-kext-collection">Disassembling the boot kext collection</h2>

<p>For debugging, I also had to disassemble the newly created Boot Kext Collection in Ghidra.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ghidra isn’t updated for macOS 11 and will refuse to load the file, first giving an error about XML DOCTYPE, then - once that’s worked around - an <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/2192">IOException</a> from the invalid <code>ntools</code> value in the <code>LC_BUILD_VERSION</code> load command.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/macos11/patch_boot_kext_collection_for_ghidra.py">script</a> to fix up the kext collection so that Ghidra can load it.</p>

<p>Note that this is still not perfect - Ghidra still doesn’t fixup pointers or read symbols.</p>

<p>To get method names, I also disassembled the raw kernel file (<code>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel.release.t8020</code>) for cross reference. Note that the raw kernel is based at a different address - you can either rebase it in Ghidra, or just be careful to convert addresses.</p>

<h2 id="disable-pac">Disable PAC</h2>

<p>I already had a <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">modified QEMU to boot an iOS kernel</a> (which has inspired others, such as <a href="https://alephsecurity.com/">Aleph Security</a>, to build much better open-source iOS emulation platforms)</p>

<p>In early 2019 I updated my modified QEMU to work with PAC for the iPhone Xs/Xr.</p>

<p>QEMU by that time already supported PAC instructions; however, Apple <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/02/examining-pointer-authentication-on.html">modified</a> the crypto algorithm when implementing PAC, so the kernel fails to boot.</p>

<p>I decided to instead <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu/commit/16613b67ad15a902791109077ebfb1091f1873aa">turn PAC instructions</a> into no-ops, since I don’t know how Apple’s algorithm worked. This also makes it easier to debug the kernel.</p>

<p>Since the macOS DTK used an A12z processor, the modified QEMU just worked.</p>

<h2 id="device-tree">Device tree</h2>

<p>Like iOS, macOS on Apple Silicon uses a <strong>device tree</strong> to describe hardware to the kernel, and to pass boot arguments.</p>

<p>macOS 11.0.1 beta’s installer doesn’t contain a device tree for the DTK: I suspect it would be in the .ipsw files, which are not publically available. Instead, I borrowed the iPad Pro’s device tree from iOS 14 beta 3.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">iOS in QEMU experiments</a>, I first disabled every piece of hardware in the device tree except the serial port.</p>

<p>Unlike iOS, macOS expects some more information in the device tree:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ram size (since Macs have upgradeable RAM)</li>
  <li>nvram, otherwise panics with a null pointer while reading nonce-seed. (I copied nvram from <a href="https://gist.github.com/bazad/1faef1a6fe396b820a43170b43e38be1">bazad’s dump of an iPhone device tree</a>.)</li>
  <li>AMCC (KTRR) register positions</li>
  <li>System Integrity Protection status</li>
</ul>

<p>I rewrote my <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/XNUQEMUScripts/blob/macos1101b1/FourthTry/DTRewriter.java">device tree editor</a> to allow populating these extra params.</p>

<h2 id="up-to-launchd">Up to launchd</h2>

<p>I can’t actually boot a macOS root filesystem as I don’t have an emulated hard disk.</p>

<p>I don’t have a recovery ramdisk either: that would likely only be included in the DTK IPSW, which is not public.</p>

<p>Instead, I decided to boot with an iOS ramdisk to test the kernel, and disable signature checking using a GDB breakpoint.</p>

<p>I also couldn’t get the trustcache (list of executables trusted by the kernel) to load. I tried following <a href="https://alephsecurity.com/2019/06/25/xnu-qemu-arm64-2/">Aleph Security’s guide</a>, but macOS 11 is more strict than iOS 12 and needs it below the kernel; I couldn’t figure out the correct memory address.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-took-so-long">Why it took so long</h2>

<p>I actually had this blog post ready since <a href="https://gist.github.com/zhuowei/27816d39f234468cf2956479c0dea7ad">August 9th</a>, but I spent an extra 3 months trying to fix issues, since I really wanted to at least get to a shell!</p>

<p>Unfortunately:</p>
<ul>
  <li>debugging why drivers wasn’t loading was hard</li>
  <li>I couldn’t disable signature checking properly</li>
  <li>I wanted to wait until Apple released an A14 kernel instead of the DTK’s A12, so that we can look at how virtualization works, but they never did</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s now November 9th and Apple’s holding their press conference tomorrow: so it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAbhrDUrqM">now or never</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-left">What’s left</h2>

<p>I’m probably not going to be working further on this, but here’s what one can do to make this an actual useful research platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figure out why half the drivers aren’t loading at all</li>
  <li>Write basic drivers/emulations:
    <ul>
      <li>probably emulate AIC in QEMU (based on Project Sandcastle’s Linux driver) since a custom interrupt controller Kext would be hard to write</li>
      <li>port Apple’s old <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/AppleMacRiscPCI/AppleMacRiscPCI-3.4/AppleMacRiscPCI.cpp.auto.html">PowerPC PCIE</a> drivers, since it’s too hard to emulate the Apple Silicon PCIE controller. This will allow us to connect a virtual hard drive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Switch to the A14 kernel when Apple releases Apple Silicon Macs, so we can test virtualization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How to modify QEMU to disable PAC</li>
  <li>How iBoot on Apple Silicon passes boot options in the device tree</li>
  <li>How to generate an Apple Silicon kernel cache without an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
  <li>How to fight <code>kmutil</code> for the real error message</li>
  <li>Never procrastinate on a blog post for three months</li>
</ul>
