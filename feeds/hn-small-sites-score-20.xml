<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">Appendix</a>, <a href="https://blog.alexa.com/sites-for-market-research/">here</a>, or <a href="https://web.jinfo.com/go/blog/73431">here</a></li>
<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
<li>If you can use the gathering to bootstrap a group chat or community, so much the better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone just as an excuse to make yourself complete a project
<ul>
<li>Sure you could proofread your own document.  But if you hire a proofreader, you have to actually deliver them something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Just ask for things
<ul>
<li>Free upgrades</li>
<li>Coupons
<ul>
<li>At checkout you can just ask “Do you have any coupons I can apply to this?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises</li>
<li>Better terms in a job offer
<ul>
<li>Easier than asking for a raise - you have more leverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waiving admission or graduation requirements</li>
<li>It’s okay if the things are crazy.  You can always mollify afterward by saying “I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>
<li>It’s not weird unless you make it weird</li>
<li>Everyone knows some starving artists and needs to buy holiday gifts</li>
<li>Doesn’t apply to every service obviously: don’t take out loans from your friends</li>
</ul>

<p id="introduction">The Transformer architecture<cite key="vaswani2017attention"></cite>
    has been powering a number of the recent advances in NLP. A breakdown of this architecture is provided <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">here</a> <cite key="alammar2018illustrated"></cite>. Pre-trained language models based on the architecture,
    in both its auto-regressive<cite key="liu2018generating,radford2018improving,radford2019language,brown2020language"></cite> (models that use their own output as input to next time-steps and that process tokens from left-to-right, like GPT2)
    and denoising<cite key="devlin2018bert,liu2019roberta,lan2019albert,lewis2019bart,raffel2019exploring"></cite> (models trained by corrupting/masking the input and that process tokens bidirectionally, like BERT)
    variants continue to push the envelope in various tasks in NLP and, more recently, in computer vision<cite key="dosovitskiy2020image"></cite>. Our understanding of why these models work so well, however, still lags behind these developments.
</p>

<p>This exposition series continues the pursuit to interpret<cite key="rogers2020primer,atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    and visualize<cite key="vig2019visualizing,madsen2019visualizing,hoover2020,tenney2020language,wallace2019allennlp"></cite>
    the inner-workings of transformer-based language models.

We illustrate how some key interpretability methods apply to transformer-based language models. This article focuses on auto-regressive models, but these methods are applicable to other architectures and tasks as well.
     
</p>

<p>This is the first article in the series. In it, we present explorables and visualizations aiding the intuition of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Input Saliency</strong> methods that score input tokens importance to generating a token.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Neuron Activations</strong> and how individual and groups of model neurons spike in response to
        inputs and to produce outputs.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The next article addresses <strong>Hidden State Evolution</strong> across the layers of the model and what it may tell us about each layer's role.</p>

<!--more-->

<!--
    <li>
        <strong>Attention</strong>, a central concept in transformers, and how recent work<cite key="abnar2020quantifying"></cite>
        leads to visualizations that are more faithful to its role.
    </li>
-->

<p>In the language of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) literature like Molnar et al.<cite key="molnar2020interpretable"></cite>, input saliency is a method that explains individual predictions. The latter two methods fall under the
    umbrella of "analyzing components of more complex models", and are better described as increasing the transparency<cite key="du2019techniques,carvalho2019machine"> </cite> of transformer models.
</p>

<p>Moreover, this article is accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/tree/main/notebooks">reproducible notebooks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jalammar/ecco/">Ecco - an open source library</a> to create similar
    interactive interfaces directly in Jupyter notebooks<cite key="ragan2014jupyter"></cite>
    for GPT-based<cite key="radford2018improving"></cite> models from the HuggingFace transformers library<cite key="wolf2019huggingface"></cite>.
</p>

<p>If we're to impose the three components we're examining to explore the architecture of the transformer, it would look like the following figure.</p>

        By introducing tools that visualize input saliency, the evolution of hidden states, and neuron activations, we aim to enable researchers to build more intuition about Transformer language models.

<h2 id="saliency">Input Saliency</h2>

<p>When a computer vision model classifies a picture as containing a husky, saliency maps can tell us whether the classification was made due to the visual properties of the animal itself, or because of the snow in the background<cite key="ribeiro2016whyribeiro2016why"></cite>. This is a method of <i>attribution</i> explaining the relationship between a model's output and inputs -- helping us detect errors and biases, and better understand the behavior of the system.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/dog-saliency-map.jpg">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Input saliency map attributing a model's prediction to input pixels.
        </strong> <br>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multiple methods exist for assigning importance scores to the inputs of an NLP model<cite key="li2015visualizing,arrieta2020explainable"></cite>. The literature is most often concerned with this application for classification tasks, rather than natural
    language generation. This article focuses on language generation. Our first interface calculates feature importance after each token is generated, and by
    hovering or tapping on an output token, imposes a saliency map on the tokens responsible for generating it.
</p>

<p>
    The first example for this interface asks GPT2-XL<cite key="radford2019language"></cite> for William Shakespeare's date of birth. The model is correctly able to produce the date (1564, but broken into two tokens: " 15" and "64", because the model's vocabulary does not include " 1564" as a single token). The interface shows the importance of each input token when generating each output token:
</p>
<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of Shakespeare's birth
            year using Gradient × Input.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        GPT2-XL is able to tell the birth date of William Shakespeare expressed in two tokens. In generating the
        first token, 53% of the importance is assigned to the name (20% to the first name, 33% to the last name).
        The next most important two tokens are " year" (22%) and " born" (14%). In generating the second token to
        complete the date, the name still is the most important with 60% importance, followed by the first portion
        of the date -- a model output, but an input to the second time step. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe world knowledge. It was generated using greedy decoding. Smaller variants of GPT2
        were not able to output the correct date.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our second example attempts to both probe a model's world knowledge, as well as to see if the model
    repeats the patterns in the text (simple patterns like the periods after numbers and like new lines, and
    slightly more involved patterns like completing a numbered list). The model used here is DistilGPT2<cite key="sanh2020distilbert"></cite>.
</p>

<p>This explorable shows a more detailed view that displays the attribution percentage for each token -- in case you need that precision.</p>

<figure>
   
    
    <br>
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a list of EU countries</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was generated by DistilGPT2 and attribution via Gradients X Inputs. Output sequence is cherry-picked to
        only include European countries and uses sampled (non-greedy) decoding. Some model runs would include China,
        Mexico, and other countries in the list. With the exception of the repeated " Finland", the model continues
        the list alphabetically.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another example that we use illustratively in the rest of this article is one where we ask the model to complete
    a simple pattern:</p>

<figure>
   
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of a simple
            alternating pattern of commas and the number one.</strong>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        Every generated token ascribes the first token in the input the highest feature importance score. Then
        throughout the sequence, the preceding token, and the first three tokens in the sequence are often the most
        important. This uses Gradient × Inputs on GPT2-XL. <br>
        This prompt aims to probe the model's response to syntax and token patterns. Later in the article, we build
        on it by switching to counting instead of repeating the digit ' 1'. Completion gained using greedy decoding.
        DistilGPT2 is able to complete it correctly as well.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is also possible to use the interface to analyze the responses of a transformer-based conversational agent.
    In the following example, we pose an existential question to DiabloGPT<cite key="zhang2020dialogpt"></cite>:
</p>

<figure>

    
    
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Explorable: Input saliency of DiabloGPT's answer to the ultimate question</strong> <br>
        <strong>Tap or hover over</strong> the output tokens.<br>
        This was the model's first response to the prompt. The question mark is attributed the highest score in the
        beginning of the output sequence. Generating the tokens " will" and " ever" assigns noticeably more importance to
        the word " ultimate".
        This uses Gradient × Inputs on DiabloGPT-large.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/ecco/blob/main/notebooks/Ecco_Input_Saliency.ipynb"><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/colab-badge.svg"></a>
</p>

<h3>About Gradient-Based Saliency</h3>
<p>Demonstrated above is scoring feature importance based on Gradients X Inputs<cite key="denil2015extraction,shrikumar2017just"></cite>-- a gradient-based saliency method shown by Atanasova et al.<cite key="atanasova2020diagnostic"></cite>
    to perform well across various datasets for text classification in transformer models.
</p>

<p>To illustrate how that works, let's
    first recall how the model generates the output token in each time step. In the following figure, we see how
    <span>①</span>
    the
    language model's final hidden state is projected into the model's vocabulary resulting in a numeric score for
    each
    token in the model's vocabulary. Passing that scores vector through a softmax operation results in a probability
    score for each token. <span>②</span> We proceed to select a token
    (e.g. select the highest-probability scoring token, or sample from the top scoring tokens) based
    on
    that vector.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/111.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient-based input saliency
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span>③</span> By calculating the gradient of the
    selected logit (before the softmax) with respect to the inputs by back-propagating it all the way back to the
    input tokens, we get a signal of how important each token was in the calculation resulting in this generated
    token.
    That assumption is based on the idea that the smallest change in the input token with the highest
    feature-importance
    value makes a large change in what the resulting output of the model would be.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/explaining/gradXinput.PNG">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>
            Figure: Gradient X input calculation and aggregation
        </strong>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The resulting gradient vector per token is then multiplied by the input embedding of the respective token. Taking
    the L2 norm of the resulting vector results in the token's feature importance score. We then normalize the
    scores by dividing by the sum of these scores.</p>

<p>More formally, <span>gradient</span> × <span>input</span> is described as follows:</p>

<p>
    <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mi><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>:</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><msub><mo stretchy="false">∥</mo><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \lVert \nabla _{X_i} f_c (X_{1:n})  X_i\lVert_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>
    Where <span id="input_term"></span> is the embedding vector of the input token at timestep <i>i</i>, and <span id="grad"></span> is the back-propagated gradient of the score of the selected token unpacked as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span id="input_embeddings"></span> is the list of …</li></ul></div></div>

December 22, 2020 | https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Should you work hard? Depending on your definition of "hard," it's a
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504" target="_blank">controversial question</a>. Let's assume a
baseline level of hardness is roughly 40 hours per week of mostly focused work.
In other words, this is your typical "good employee" at a 9-to-5: they do their
time and they do good work, then they go home and focus on other things. This
is very respectable.</p><p>What about going above and beyond? There are two sides to this. Bronnie Ware
says that one of the top five <a href="https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/" target="_blank">regrets of the
dying</a> is "I wish I
hadn't worked so hard":</p><blockquote>
<p>This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's
youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But
as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been
breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of
their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.</p>
</blockquote><p>On the other hand, we can probably all think of several highly successful people
who worked more than 40 hours per week. My favorite example is Henry Eyring, the
chemist. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300985.Mormon_Scientist" target="_blank">His
biography</a> is one
of the few books I've read twice, and he's one of my personal role models. He
was ambitious, worked extremely hard and achieved a lot—but he did this without
compromising on anything more important. He was a good husband, father, teacher
and leader. He touched the lives of many.</p><p>There are additional arguments for both sides of the debate. But what's the
resolution to this paradox? I think it's something that I've started calling
"alignment." Alignment is the situation in which there's a high correlation
between the effort you put into life and the good that comes out. In other
words, it's when your work is aligned with what's most important.</p><p>I hypothesize that the real problem with many of Bronnie
Ware's patients wasn't that they worked too hard—the problem is that they
worked too hard on things that, at the end of the day, weren't as important to
them as they thought. Notice that the #1 regret was "I wish I'd had the
courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
Perhaps the regret of working too hard was really just a symptom of this deeper
regret.</p><p>If you want to spend your life working really hard, it's critical to mould
yourself and your situation until working hard is actually worth it. Otherwise
you have two bad choices:</p><ul>
<li>Work hard and later regret that you neglected more important things</li>
<li>Don't work hard and later regret that you didn't fulfill your dreams</li>
</ul><p>I really like <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">Sam Altman's
advice</a> on "how to
achieve outlier success." I think it describes well this idea of alignment:</p><p>(Update since this got on HN and some people are taking issue with part of the quote:
read the whole post, or at least the opening two paragraphs, the footnote, and the
parts of the quote I ellided.)</p><blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone I've ever met would be well-served by spending more time
thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right
thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on
stuff that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small
handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving
person who is very successful. ...</p>
<p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart
or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th
percentile requires both.... Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs,
and it's perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of
advantages. ... And it's often really fun. One of the great joys in life is
finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact
matters to something larger than yourself.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in
certain parts of the US.... I think people who pretend you can be super
successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of
your life) are doing a disservice.</p>
<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard
work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have
for the benefits to pay off.</p>
</blockquote><p>I've had several different experiences with alignment over the past six years:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>For a large, early chunk of my mission, I was completely out of alignment.
I didn't enjoy being a missionary at all—it was a living hell—and it seemed
like our efforts didn't make a difference anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I changed a lot partway through my mission. One of the things I most enjoyed
about the end of my mission was the satisfaction of working hard all day, every
day on something that mattered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although my experience at BYU was positive overall, there was lots of
pressure from the system to work very hard, even though a large chunk of my
time was spent on things that didn't contribute to my education (this
category includes a lot of homework, most lectures, and almost all exams).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being an employee was alright. I went in with the desire to make a real
contribution to Lucid and I like to think I achieved that goal. Although it
wasn't the work I wanted to spend the rest of my life on, I did learn a lot
and the money I saved up is a great benefit to me now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that I've quit my job and have become a startup founder, it's
the first time since my mission where
I feel that I have perfect alignment. I work a
lot, but it doesn't feel like work. I don't look forward to the weekends
anymore; I love every day. Things will get more stressful as we progress, but
I'm excited.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For me, having alignment means being a startup founder because I'm ambitious and
there are specific things I want to build—I'm not satisfied by working on
whatever the company that hired me happens to be building. But all that being
said, alignment is important for everyone, regardless of what your individual
goals and desires are. As with most <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things" target="_blank">hard
things</a>,
there's no formula for alignment. You have to figure out what it means for you
and how to get it. But being aware of the concept is at least the first step.</p><p>I write this all as a reminder to myself. I hope my life never falls out
of alignment.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>STOCKHOLM — Sweden is rethinking its security, and whether it really is safest outside NATO.</p>



<p>Two years out from the next election, debate over whether to join the Western defense alliance is intensifying, setting up a left-versus-right clash on the question in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current minority government of Social Democrats and Greens — plus their allies the Left Party — remain staunchly against, citing the value of neutrality in what they see as a polarizing world.</p>



<p>On the other side, four traditionally allied center-right parties — the Moderate Party, the Liberals, the Center Party and the Christian Democrats — are in favor, saying Sweden needs the security of the defense guarantees that NATO membership offers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pro-NATO side scored a big win last week when the far-right Sweden Democrats, who are angling for closer cooperation with the center-right bloc in a range of policy areas, reversed a previous anti-NATO stance and backed a motion for Sweden to adopt a so-called NATO option — allowing it to join NATO at some point in the future.&nbsp;Parliament voted in favor of the motion by 204 votes to 145.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Issues of defense don’t normally sit high on the agenda in elections here, but since the Sweden Democrats have now moved their position, we could well see more interest,” said Allan Widman, a lawmaker with the Liberal Party and spokesman on defense policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting a “NATO option” is not a commitment to join — Finland has had such an option since 1995 and remains outside the pact — but is widely seen as a movement in that direction. The government has acknowledged as much by so far refusing to act on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign Minister Ann Linde called parliamentary backing for the move “a significant negative event for Swedish security.”</p>



<p>For Sweden, joining NATO would be a big policy shift, as it would end more than 200 years of official military neutrality. The country has not formally taken sides in a war since Napoleon was advancing across Europe, and has over recent years sought to carve out a diplomatic role as an impartial international arbiter while at the same time developing a closer partnership with NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swedish NATO membership would also shake up a delicate balance of power in the volatile Baltic Sea region, where officially unaligned Sweden and Finland and NATO members Denmark, Germany, Poland and the Baltic states regularly face off against Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, Sweden <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/security-alert-sweden-gotland-cold-war-memories/" target="_blank">deployed</a> troops to its Baltic island of Gotland after a security scare triggered by Russian warships sailing close to the island.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian military jets regularly enter Swedish airspace without permission and many pointed the finger at Russia when a mysterious submarine was detected in waters close to the capital Stockholm in 2014.</p>



<p>Analysts say that last week’s vote in the Swedish parliament on the NATO option likely signals the start of a new phase in the wrangling over full entry into the alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can now expect a more comprehensive political debate about an eventual Swedish membership,” Calle Håkansson, an analyst at the think tank the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told public service television.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arguments of both sides are already clear. The Social Democrats’ resistance is based on a long-held belief that Sweden’s “freedom from alliances,” as the party calls it, has served the country well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist has engineered a range of joint training exercises with NATO, such as the cold weather <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shape.nato.int/news-archive/2019/nato-allies-participate-in-swedish-exercise-northern-wind" target="_blank">exercise </a>Northern Wind in Sweden in March 2019, but at every turn, he has sought to underline Swedish independence.</p>



<p>The Social Democrats say that joining NATO would represent unnecessary antagonization of Russia, and risk destabilizing an already tense security situation along Europe’s eastern flank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t want to go down a road of security policy experiments or adventurism,” Hulqvist <a href="https://www.dn.se/debatt/m-tycks-vara-ensidigt-fokuserade-pa-nato-medlemskap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> in an editorial in August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Widman, of the pro-NATO Liberals, said Sweden’s strategy has left it in a security “no-man’s land,” viewed by Russia as part of the “European security system” but lacking the guarantee of the NATO members’ commitment to mutual defense.</p>



<p>“That is a very dangerous position to find yourself in,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While public support for NATO membership in Finland has remained low and steady, in Sweden it has been rising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research by Gothenburg University’s SOM Institute <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2020-06/7.%20Swedish%20trends%20%281986-2019%29_v2.pdf" target="_blank">shows</a> roughly equal support (around 30 percent) for joining NATO as those opposed. In 1994, when the SOM Institute began researching the question, 48 percent said joining was a bad idea versus 15 percent in favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the issue develops will depend on the rival sides’ abilities to convince voters ahead of the 2022 vote. If the pro-NATO side does well at the polls and knock the minority center-left incumbents out of power, they could push for a referendum on the question, experts say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson has previously said that he believes Sweden will be a member of NATO before the decade is out and he called the NATO option vote “historic.” In a social media <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIkl1Cdp4IU/" target="_blank">post</a>, he said it would allow Sweden to “update and modernize” its security stance and tell the world that Sweden is ready to join NATO at a future point of its choosing.</p>



<p>“A government can’t just look away from a parliamentary majority view in a foreign policy or security question,” he said. “We expect the government to get behind the parliament’s security policy line.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Decisions have always been hard for me, especially when I'm overwhelmed. For example, I break down in front of restaurants because I can't decide if I want to go in or pick a different restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Between working remotely and social distancing, I have spent a lot of time alone this year. The hardest part is needing to make way more decisions for myself. I have to decide when to get up, what to eat, what to work on, and what to do with my free time. Sure, these were largely in my control before, but I relied a lot on social pressure to choose.</span></p>
<p><span>When I was researching </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aslawrence/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Adam</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-8th-2020-mastering-the-art-of-the-playbook" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>our interview</span></a><span>, I found his user guide </span><span></span><span>and decided to write one for myself. Both his and the one from the original </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>First Round Review piece</span></a><span> are written from the perspective of a manager, but user guides can be just as helpful for individual contributors. The point is sharing how best to work with you, which is especially important at a time when fewer teams are in-person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created a template (</span><a href="https://www.notion.so/thekatieharper/User-Guide-Outline-e3130055035b455bab61c5400e96e66c" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>which you can copy here</span></a><span>) and then got stuck. Every bullet point represents a decision that I need to make about myself. My startup job requires me to make decisions constantly, and I actually enjoy that process. But I feel entirely different when it’s a personal decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>User guides are essentially a branding exercise, and I worry that I will get called a liar for my choices. I brand myself as a morning person, a proactive doer, and a workaholic. But I’m writing this at night, at the last minute, having spent all weekend </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> working (though also somehow not relaxing). Are my stories based on truth or aspiration?</span></p>
<p><span>Decisions also open us up to rejection. By listing my preferences, personality traits, and pet peeves, I’m publishing a quick way to judge me. What if someone sees this and doesn’t want to work with me?</span></p>
<p><span>Often decisions feel selfish to me. When I decide what time of day I prefer meetings, I feel guilty for prioritizing my own wants over someone else’s. Writing a user guide forces you to confront the stories you tell about yourself. And you have to be vulnerable enough that people will actually learn something useful from reading what you write.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A year ago I was in a relationship with someone who never decided anything. Now I see that </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> deciding was selfish. And I don’t want to be that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the end, this piece is my user guide, because it says more about me than a checklist can.</span></p>

        <section>
            <div><blockquote>
<p>Learn how to configure K3s on bare-metal to run a Kubernetes cluster with just as much resilience and fault tolerance as a managed service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tutorial is a follow-on from my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/kubernetes-in-10-minutes/">Kubernetes on bare-metal in 10 minutes</a> from 2017. The original post focused on getting <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> working across a number of bare-metal hosts running Ubuntu, and then it went on to deploy a microservice and the dashboard. It was a primer, and written to help new users kick the tires with Kubernetes. It used production-ready kubeadm, but only used one master node, meaning it couldn't tolerate a failure.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to provide you with a HA, production-ready cluster on bare-metal infrastructure. We will use <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> for the hosts, automate the boring parts, but do the rest step by step, so that you can get an understanding on what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, we will review the setup and discuss other options for running on-premises or in a homelab with Raspberry Pis. We will also compare kube-vip to other solutions for bare-metal and self-hosted networking.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/kube-vip-ha-k3s--6-.png" alt="kube-vip-ha-k3s--6-"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conceptual diagram: kubectl access provided by the stable EIP. The IngressController also has an EIP which  routes traffic for services exposed with Ingress such as the OpenFaaS gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post also moves from kubeadm to using <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a> (a <a href="https://cncf.io/">CNCF</a> project), which requires fewer resources for its control-plane and has a built-in HA mode using embedded <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>. K3s has been generally available (GA) and production ready since 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk">Follow me on Twitter @alexellisuk</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>We will use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create the nodes on <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal (aka Packet)</a> servers, k3s to create a HA control-plane, and <a href="https://kube-vip.io/">kube-vip</a> to configure a HA IP address for the API server.</p>
<p>The setup will be able to tolerate at least one failure of a server. So unlike the 2017 post, our servers will form a HA cluster, and will also have an Elastic IP (EIP) configured so that the Kubernetes API server will remain accessible if one or more of the servers becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, the Cloud Controller Manager add-on has several responsibilities including node management, routing and managing services. At the end of the tutorial, not only will your cluster have a HA control-plane, a stable IP for the API Server, but Equinix Metal's (CCM) will also allow you to expose services as type LoadBalancer. Each IP address costs around 3.25 USD / mo, you can find out more details on the IP Addresses section of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Skill level: intermediate to advanced. You should be familiar with Kubernetes, networking and public cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="installtheprerequisites">Install the pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Download <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a>, a portable Kubernetes marketplace and downloader for DevOps CLIs. It will be used to download the tools we need for the tutorial. You are of course welcome to do things the hard way, if you prefer.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh

# Install the binary using the command given as output, such as: 
sudo cp arkade-darwin /usr/local/bin/arkade

# Or on Linux:
sudo cp arkade /usr/local/bin/arkade
</code></pre>
<p>Download the following CLIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kubectl</code> - the Kubernetes CLI</li>
<li><code>k3sup</code> - a k3s installer that works over SSH</li>
<li><code>terraform</code> - an Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, which we'll used to create the initial hosts</li>
<li><code>kubectx</code> - a fast way to check and switch your Kubernetes context between clusters</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>arkade get kubectl
arkade get k3sup
arkade get terraform
arkade get kubectx
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the step to put these binaries into your PATH:</p>
<pre><code># Add (k3sup) to your PATH variable
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.arkade/bin/
</code></pre>
<h3 id="provisionyournodes">Provision your nodes</h3>
<p>We will use terraform to provision three servers and two agents. You can alter these numbers, but three is the minimum number required for K3s' built-in HA mode using etcd.</p>
<p>You may well ask why the entire blog post isn't just a single Terraform command. I can hear you Hacker News. This point of this post isn't to do all the work for you, but to help you understand what is required, and in what order. Creating hosts is boring, so we are going to automate that and save you some time.</p>
<p>Save <code>main.tfvars</code> with the following:</p>
<pre><code>terraform {
  required_providers {
    packet = {
      source = "terraform-providers/packet"
      version = "~&gt; 3.2.1"
    }
  }
  required_version = "&gt;= 0.13"
}

variable "api_token" {
  description = "Equinix Metal API token"
}

variable "project_id" {
  description = "Equinix Metal Project ID"
}

variable "servers" {
  description = "Count of servers"
}

variable "agents" {
  description = "Count of agents"
}

provider "packet" {
  auth_token=var.api_token
}

resource "packet_ssh_key" "key1" {
  name       = "k3sup-1"
  public_key = file("/home/alex/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-server" {
  count		         = var.servers
  hostname         = "k3s-server-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-agent" {
  count 	         = var.agents
  hostname         = "k3s-agent-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

output "server_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-server.*.access_public_ipv4
}

output "agent_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-agent.*.access_public_ipv4
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then create <code>main.tfvars</code></p>
<pre><code>api_token   =   ""
project_id  =   ""
servers     =   3
agents      =   2
</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>api_token</code> and <code>project_id</code> with the values from the Equinix Metal dashboard. The API key is found on your user profile.</p>
<p>If you wish to change the size of the nodes, you can edit <code>c1.small.x86</code> and use a different value. You can find the options in your dashboard.</p>
<p>Now run the terraform to create the hosts:</p>
<pre><code>terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=main.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=main.tfvars
</code></pre>
<p>When the hosts have been created, you'll get output with your IP addresses.</p>
<pre><code>agent_ips = [
  "147.75.81.203",
  "147.75.33.3",
]
server_ips = [
  "147.75.32.35",
  "147.75.80.83",
  "147.75.32.99",
]
</code></pre>
<p>Open a terminal and write environment variables for each:</p>
<pre><code>export SERVER1=""
export SERVER2=""
export SERVER3=""

export AGENT1=""
export AGENT2=""
</code></pre>
<p>Save this file as <code>hosts.txt</code> as you may need it again later.</p>

<p>K3s can run in a HA mode, where a failure of a master node can be tolerated. This isn't enough for public-facing clusters, where a stable IP address for the Kubernetes control-plane is required.</p>
<p>We need a stable IP for port 6443, which we could also call an Elastic IP or EIP. Fortunately BGP can help us there. One of our three master nodes will advertise its IP address as the route for the EIP, then if it goes down, another will start advertising. This means our clients can always depend on a stable address of: <code>https://$EIP:6443</code> for connecting to the Kubernetes API server.</p>
<p>Obtain an IP address from your EM dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IPs &amp; Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request IP Address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the same region that you'll use for the nodes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a <code>/32</code> for a single IP for the control-plane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time for an engineer to approve the request.</p>
<p>Once you have the IP, set it in an environment variable:</p>
<pre><code>export EIP="147.75.100.237"
</code></pre>
<p>Add this line to <code>hosts.txt</code> so that you have it, if you need it later.</p>
<h3 id="enablebgpforeachserver">Enable BGP for each server</h3>
<p>Click on each server in the Equinix Metal dashboard. Click on its details page, then BGP. Find the Manage button on the IPv4 row and click "Enable BGP".</p>
<p>This setting allows BGP to be advertised from this server.</p>
<h3 id="provisionthefirstmaster">Provision the first master</h3>
<p>For various reasons, we can only set up kube-vip after K3s has started, so we will create the first master node:</p>
<pre><code>k3sup install \
  --ip $SERVER1 \
  --tls-san $EIP \
  --cluster \
  --k3s-channel latest \
  --k3s-extra-args "--no-deploy servicelb --disable-cloud-controller" \
  --merge \
  --local-path $HOME/.kube/config \
  --context=em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--tls-san</code> is required to advertise the EIP, so that K3s will create a valid certificate for the API server.</li>
<li>the <code>--k3s-channel</code> is specifying the latest version of K3s, which in this instance will be 1.19, by the time you run this tutorial, it may have changed, in which can you can give <code>1.19</code> as the channel, or a specific version with <code>--k3s-version</code></li>
<li>note the <code>--cluster</code> flag, which tells the server to use etcd to create a cluster for the servers we will join later on</li>
<li><code>--local-path</code>, <code>--context</code> and <code>--merge</code> all allow us to merge the KUBECONFIG from the K3s to our local file.</li>
<li>in <code>--k3s-extra-args</code> we disable the built-in K3s service load-balancer, and also disable the cloud-controller, because we will use the Equinix Metal Cloud Controller Manager instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now check your kubeconfig file is pointing at the right cluster:</p>
<pre><code>kubectx em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<p>Try querying the nodes in the cluster:</p>
<pre><code>[alex@nuc ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS     ROLES         AGE   VERSION
k3s-server-1   Ready      etcd,master   7s    v1.19.5+k3s2
</code></pre>
<p>Apply the RBAC so that kube-vip can access the Kubernetes API and configure services:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f https://kube-vip.io/manifests/rbac.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now log into the first server using SSH. There is a one-time configuration option required for each server.</p>
<pre><code>ssh root@$SERVER1

ctr image pull docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0

alias kube-vip="ctr run --rm --net-host docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0"
export INTERFACE=lo
export EIP="147.75.100.237"

kube-vip vip /kube-vip manifest daemonset \
  --interface $INTERFACE \
  --vip $EIP \
  --controlplane \
  --services \
  --inCluster \
  --taint \
  --bgp \
  --packet \
  --provider-config /etc/cloud-sa/cloud-sa.json | tee /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>The manifest for kube-vip will be created at <code>/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml</code>, any files placed here will be run by K3s.</p>
<p>Log out of the server</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: CPS-conversion and defunctionalization can help you to come up with a constant-stack algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Turns out I inadvertedly plagiarized the talk <a href="https://t.co/YlN0MOnN83?amp=1">The Best Refactoring You’ve Never Heard Of</a> by James Koppel. Please consider this a form of sincere flattery.</p>
<h3 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h3>
<p>Today, I’ll take you on a another little walk through the land of program transformations. Let’s begin with a simple binary tree, with value of unknown type in the leaves, as well as the canonical <code>map</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>T</span> a <span>=</span> <span>L</span> a <span>|</span> <span>B</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> a)

<span>map1 ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map1 f (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
map1 f (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (map1 f t1) (map1 f t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this <code>map</code> function is using the program stack as it traverses the tree. Our goal is now to come up with a <code>map</code> function that does <em>not</em> use the stack!</p>
<p>Why? Good question! In Haskell, there wouldn’t be a strong need for this, as the Haskell stack is allocated on the heap, just like your normal data, so there is plenty of stack space. But in other languages or environments, the stack space may have a hard limit, and it may be advised to not use unbounded stack space.</p>
<p>That aside, it’s a fun exercise, and that’s sufficient reason for me.</p>
<p>(In the following, I assume that tail-calls, i.e. those where a function end with another function call, but without modifying its result, do not actually use stack space. Once <em>all</em> recursive function calls are tail calls, the code is equivalent to an imperative loop, as we will see.)</p>
<h3 id="think">Think?</h3>
<p>We <em>could</em> now just stare at the problem (rather the code), and try to come up with a solution directly. We’d probably think “ok, as I go through the tree, I have to remember all the nodes <em>above</em> me… so I need a list of those nodes… and for each of these nodes, I also need to remember whether I am currently processing the left child, and yet have to look at the right one, or whether I am done with the left child… so what do I have to remember about the current node…?”</p>
<p>… ah, my brain spins already. Maybe eventually I figure it out, but why think when we can <em>derive</em> the solution? So let’s start with above <code>map1</code>, and rewrite it, in several, mechanical, steps into a stack-less, tail-recursive solution.</p>
<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>Before we set out, let me rewrite the <code>map</code> function using a local <code>go</code> helper, as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map2 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map2 f t <span>=</span> go t
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (go t1) (go t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>This transformation (effectively the “static argument transformation”) has the nice advantage that we do not have to pass <code>f</code> around all the time, and that when we copy the function, I only have to change the top-level name, but not the names of the inner functions.</p>
<p>Also, I find it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="cps">CPS</h3>
<p>A blunt, effective tool to turn code that is not yet using tail-calls into code that only uses tail-calls is use <em>continuation-passing style</em>. If we have a function of type <code>… -&gt; t</code>, we turn it into a function of type <code>… -&gt; (t -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code>, where <code>r</code> is the type of the result we want at the very end. This means the function now receives an extra argument, often named <code>k</code> for continuation, and instead of returning some <code>x</code>, the function calls <code>k x</code>.</p>
<p>We can apply this to our <code>go</code> function. Here, both <code>t</code> and <code>r</code> happen to be <code>T b</code>; the type of finished trees:</p>
<pre><code>map3 :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
map3 f t = go t (\r -&gt; r)
  where
    go :: T a -&gt; (T b -&gt; T b) -&gt; T b
    go (L x) k  = k (L (f x))
    go (B t1 t2) k  = go t1 (\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></pre>
<p>Note that when initially call <code>go</code>, we pass the identity function <code>(\r -&gt; r)</code> as the initial continuation.</p>
<p>Alas, suddenly all function calls are in tail position, and this codes does not use stack space! Technically, we are done, although it is not quite satisfying; all these lambdas floating around obscure the meaning of the code, are maybe a bit slow to execute, and also, we didn’t really learn much yet. This is certainly <em>not</em> the code we would have writing after “thinking hard”.</p>
<h3 id="defunctionalization">Defunctionalization</h3>
<p>So let’s continue rewriting the code to something prettier, simpler. Something that does not use lambdas like this.</p>
<p>Again, there is a mechanical technique that can help it. It likely won't make the code prettier, but it will get rid of the lambdas, so let’s do that an clean up later.</p>
<p>The technique is called <em>defunctionalization</em> (because it replaces functional values by plain data values), and can be seen as a form of <em>refinement</em>.</p>
<p>Note that we pass around vales of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, but we certainly don’t <em>mean</em> the full type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. Instead, only very specific values of that type occur in our program, So let us replace <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code> with a data type that contains representatives of <em>just</em> the values we actually use.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We find at all values of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We create a datatype with one constructor for each of these:</p>

<p>(This is not complete yet.)</p></li>
<li><p>We introduce an <em>interpretation</em> function that turns a <code>K</code> back into a <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>=</span> (<span>*</span> <span>TBD</span> <span>*</span>)</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>In the function <code>go</code>, instead of taking a parameter of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, we take a <code>K</code>. And when we actually <em>use</em> the continuation, we have to turn the <code>K</code> back to the function using eval:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k <span>=</span> go t1 <span>K1</span></code></pre></div>
We also do this to the code fragments identified in the first step; these become:
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 K2)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; eval k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now we complete the <code>eval</code> function: For each constructor, we simply map it to the corresponding lambda from step 1:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
eval <span>K1</span> <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 <span>K2</span>)
eval <span>K2</span> <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t quite work yet: We have variables on the right hand side that are not bound (<code>t2</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>k</code>). So let’s add them to the constructors <code>K1</code> and <code>K2</code> as needed. This also changes the type <code>K</code> itself; it now needs to take type parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This leads us to the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>K</span> a b
  <span>=</span> <span>I</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>K1</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>K</span> a b)
  <span>|</span> <span>K2</span> (<span>T</span> b) (<span>K</span> a b)

<span>map4 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map4 f t <span>=</span> go t <span>I</span>
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> go t1 (<span>K1</span> t2 k)

<span>    eval ::</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
    eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
    eval (<span>K1</span> t2 k) <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 (<span>K2</span> r1 k))
    eval (<span>K2</span> r1 k) <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div>
<p>Not really cleaner or prettier, but everything is still tail-recursive, <em>and</em> we are now working with plain data.</p>
<h3 id="we-like-lists">We like lists</h3>
<p>To clean it up a little bit, we can notice that the <code>K</code> data type really is just a list of values, where the values are either <code>T a</code> or <code>T b</code>. We do not need a custom data type for this! Instead of our <code>K</code>, we can just use the following, built from standard data types:</p>
<pre><code>type K' a b = [Either (T a) (T b)]</code></pre>
<p>Now I replace <code>I</code> with <code>[]</code>, <code>K1 t2 k</code> with <code>Left t2 : k</code> and <code>K2 r1 k</code> with <code>Right r1 : k</code>. I also, very suggestively, rename <code>go</code> to <code>down</code> and <code>eval</code> to <code>up</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map5 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map5 f t <span>=</span> down t []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    down ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    down (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> up k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    down (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> down t1 (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)

<span>    up ::</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    up [] r <span>=</span> r
    up (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) r1 <span>=</span> down t2 (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    up (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) r2 <span>=</span> up k (<span>B</span> r1 r2)</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, the code suddenly makes more sense again. In fact, I can try to verbalize it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we traverse the tree, we have to remember for all parent nodes, whether there is still something <code>Left</code> to do when we come back to it (so we remember a <code>T a</code>), or if we are done with that (so we have a <code>T b</code>). This is the list <code>K' a b</code>.</p>
<p>We begin to go <code>down</code> the left of the tree (noting that the right siblings are still left to do), until we hit a leaf. We transform the leaf, and then go <code>up</code>.</p>
<p>If we go <code>up</code> and hit the root, we are done. Else, if we go <code>up</code> and there is something <code>Left</code> to do, we remember the subtree that we just processed (as that is already in the <code>Right</code> form), and go <code>down</code> the other subtree. But if we go <code>up</code> and there is nothing <code>Left</code> to do, we put the two subtrees together and continue going up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite neat!</p>
<h3 id="the-imperative-loop">The imperative loop</h3>
<p>At this point we could stop: the code is pretty, makes sense, and has the properties we want. But let’s turn the dial a bit further and try to make it an imperative loop.</p>
<p>We know that if we have a single tail-recursive function, then that’s equivalent to a loop, with the function’s parameter turning into mutable variables. But we have two functions!</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have two functions <code>a -&gt; r</code> and <code>b -&gt; r</code> that have the same return type (which they necessarily have here, since we CPS-converted them further up), then those two functions are equivalent to a <em>single</em> function taking “<code>a</code> or <code>b</code>”, i.e. <code>Either a b -&gt; r</code>. This really nothing else than the high-school level algebra rule of <span><em>r</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ⋅ <em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>r</em><sup><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></sup></span>.</p>
<p>So (after reordering the arguments of <code>down</code> to put <code>T b</code> first) we can rewrite the code as</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map6 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map6 f t <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t) []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>Either</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>L</span> x))     k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>L</span> (f x))) k
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>B</span> t1 t2)) k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t1) (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r)  []             <span>=</span> r
    go (<span>Right</span> r1) (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>B</span> r1 r2)) k</code></pre></div>
<p>Do you see the loop yet? If not, maybe it helps to compare it with the following equivalent imperative looking pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>mapLoop :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
mapLoop f t {
  var node = Left t;
  var parents = [];
  while (true) {
    switch (node) {
      Left (L x) -&gt; node := Right (L (f x))
      Left (B t1 t2) -&gt; node := Left t1; parents.push(Left t2)
      Right r1 -&gt; {
        if (parents.len() == 0) {
          return r1;
        } else {
          switch (parents.pop()) {
            Left t2  -&gt; node := Left t2; parents.push(Right r1);
            Right r2 -&gt; node := Right (B r1 r2)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Greetings fellow Nim adventurers! Below you will find 16 handy Nim tips
&amp; tricks I came across while developing a medium-sized GUI program this year,
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/koi">and</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-riff">related</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-binstreams">libraries</a>).  Some of them are
about less known or undocumented Nim features or standard library functions,
a few are workarounds for some rough edges of the language, and there’s also
a handful of useful techniques I read about in forums or have invented on my
own.</p>

<p>All tips are for Nim 1.4.2 and beyond, and most are applicable to the
C backend. I hope you’ll find something useful here that will make your time
with Nim more enjoyable and productive!</p>

<h2 id="i--the-not-so-obvious">I — The Not-So-Obvious</h2>

<h3 id="1--reducing-executable-size-by-stripping-debug-symbols">1 &nbsp; Reducing executable size by stripping debug symbols</h3>

<p>Nim touts itself as a language capable of generating small native binaries.
But just naively compiling some program with <code>nim c -d:release</code> and looking at
the file sizes will make you wonder about the validity of that claim!</p>

<p>A release build of <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
weighs around 12 megs. Anything but small, if you ask me!<sup id="fnref:small" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:small">1</a></sup> Sure, it
statically links <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-glfw">GLFW</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-nanovg">NanoVG</a> and a bunch of other Nim
libraries, but to put things into perspective, <a href="https://reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> (a
highly-advanced and complex DAW written in C/C++) is about the same size at
~13 megs! Surely, my program is much simpler than REAPER, so what’s going on
here?</p>

<p>It turns out that gcc debug symbols are included in Nim binaries by default,
which can account for a quite substantial 2-to 5-fold size increase! Luckily,
we can remove them easily with the <code>strip</code> command which comes with gcc.</p>

<p>How about trying to optimise for a small executable with <code>--opt:size</code>?  Sure,
that would yield about 30% smaller binaries, but at the expense of some
potential runtime performance loss. So while it might not always be the best
option, but you can always it <em>and</em> strip the debug symbols for even bigger
savings.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re hell-bent on producing smallest possible binary,
compressing it with an executable packer like <a href="https://upx.github.io/">UPX</a>
could be just the ticket.</p>

<p>The below table summarises my findings with some concrete data:</p>

<p>It is important to note that the presence of debug symbols in a binary <em>does
not</em> affect its runtime performance whatsoever. This is because debug symbols
are not even loaded into memory during normal use, only when debugging. So
really it only affects the space the executable takes up on disk.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering, you’ll still get nice Nim stack traces with
a stripped binary if you compiled it with <code>-d:debug</code> or <code>--stacktrace=on
--linetrace=on</code> (more on that in the next tip).</p>

<h3 id="2--release-builds-with-exception-logging">2 &nbsp; Release builds with exception logging</h3>

<p>Creating a release build with <code>-d:release</code> gives you a speed boost, but at
the price of turning off stack traces (among other things). This can be a problem
if you’re trying to implement a crash-reporting mechanism for end-users,
which involves surrounding your main method with a <code>try/except</code> block and
writing exceptions with stack traces to a log file.</p>

<p>Luckily, you don’t need to ship debug builds to your users just to be able to
do that; you can still use <code>-d:release</code> to get most optimisation benefits
while turning stack traces back on with <code>--stacktrace=on --linetrace=on</code>. The
performance of the resulting binary might be a bit slower, but you know, life
is all about the right trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="3--switching-to-arcorc">3 &nbsp; Switching to ARC/ORC</h3>

<p>Nim defaults to the <code>refc</code> garbage collector (deferred reference counting with
a mark &amp; sweep phase for cycle collection), which works very well, even for
soft-realtime requirements. But did you know that there has been a brand new
GC introduced in 1.2.x that offers reduced memory footprint and even better
performance in most cases?</p>

<p>This is ARC, the fully deterministic Automatic Reference Counting garbage
collector. Switching to ARC is as easy as supplying the <code>--gc:arc</code> option to
the compiler. It’s a drop-in replacement for most programs. Depending on your
program, you might want to use it with the <code>--deepcopy:on
--hint[Performance]:off</code> options.</p>

<p>ARC has many other benefits, including hard realtime support, shared heaps
between threads, and simplifying the C FFI.  Mind you, ARC cannot handle
cyclic data structures. But it has a big brother called ORC, which adds support
for that.</p>

<p>You can learn more about ARC and ORC in this <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/15/introduction-to-arc-orc-in-nim.html">excellent blog
post</a>
on the Nim website.</p>

<h3 id="4--executable-icons-on-windows-mingw">4 &nbsp; Executable icons on Windows (MinGW)</h3>

<p>Setting the icon for Windows executables is probably easier with Visual
Studio, but anyhow, here are the instructions for gcc/MinGW that I’m using.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, you’ll need to generate an <code>.ico</code> file that contains your icon image
in multiple resolutions. There’s lots of online tools for that, and there’s
also ImageMagick—this is outside the scope of this article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have your image, you’ll need to create a resource definition <code>.rc</code>
file that references your icon file. I used <code>appicon</code> here for the ID, but
you can use any other string, it doesn’t matter:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> appicon ICON "gridmonger.ico"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step is to create the resource object file from the <code>.rc</code> file
(<code>windres</code> is included in MinGW):</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> windres gridmonger.rc -O coff -o gridmonger.res
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we need to instruct the compiler to link the resource file
into our program:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> <span>when</span> <span>defined</span><span>(</span><span>windows</span><span>):</span>
   <span>{.</span><span>link</span><span>:</span> <span>"icons/gridmonger.res"</span><span>.}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="5--debug-echo-in-windows-gui-programs-mingw">5 &nbsp; Debug echo in Windows GUI programs (MinGW)</h3>

<p>This will be a rather short one but it took me a while to figure it out. It
turns out that when you link against the Windows libraries by passing
<code>-mwindows</code> to the linker (<code>-L:-mwindows</code>), you won’t be able to print stuff
the console with <code>echo</code> anymore.</p>

<p>“But this is a useless tip, of course you need to link against the Windows
libs in a GUI program!”, I hear you say. Well, not necessarily. In GLFW apps,
for example, you can get away with not linking against the Windows libs in
many cases. For instance, in Gridmonger I only need <code>-mwindows</code> so I can open
the standard open and save system dialogs. In my debug builds, I don’t link
against the Windows libs and I conditionally turn the calls to the dialog
functions to no-ops, and then I can do my debug printing to the console.</p>



<h3 id="6--using-keyword">6 &nbsp; ‘using’ keyword</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-using-statement">using</a>
keyword is a very useful, but often forgotten language feature. It helps to
cut down on redundancy when creating method call style APIs, or when passing
context objects around.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Without `using`</span>
<span>proc </span><span>getFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>:</span> <span>Level</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>AppContext</span><span>):</span> <span>Floor</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>proc </span><span>setFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>:</span> <span>Level</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Floor</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>AppContext</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span># With `using`</span>
<span>using</span> <span>l</span><span>:</span> <span>Level</span>
<span>using</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>AppContext</span>

<span>proc </span><span>getFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>;</span> <span>a</span><span>):</span> <span>Floor</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>proc </span><span>setFloor</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>:</span> <span>Natural</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>Floor</span><span>;</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="7--opening-urls-in-the-default-browser">7 &nbsp; Opening URLs in the default browser</h3>

<p>Did you know that the standard library has
a <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/browsers.html">browsers</a> module for the sole
purpose of opening URLs in the OS default browser in a cross-platform way?
In fact, I’ve been using Nim for 4 years and I’ve learned about this just
recently!</p>

<p>This is very handy if you want to navigate the user to a program’s website
from a desktop app, or to open local HTML documentation.</p>

<h3 id="8--cross-platform-home-and-config-directories">8 &nbsp; Cross-platform home and config directories</h3>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getHomeDir">getHomeDir()</a> and
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getConfigDir">getConfigDir()</a> from the
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html">os</a> module are super handy if you need to
handle configuration files or program data in a cross-platform way.</p>

<h3 id="9--debug-dumping-expressions">9 &nbsp; Debug dumping expressions</h3>

<p>However sophisticated modern development tools might be, just echoing stuff to
the console is still one of the easiest and quickest ways to debug a program.
But writing things like <code>echo "foo: ", foo</code> for the hundredth time gets old
really fast. The <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html#dump.m%2Cuntyped">dump</a>
macro in the standard <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html">sugar</a> module
helps with exactly that.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the other useful additions the module introduces!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sugar</span>

<span>var</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"frobnicate"</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span>

<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span># prints:</span>
<span># a = 42</span>
<span># s = frobnicate</span>
<span># a + x = 49</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="10--measuring-elapsed-time">10 &nbsp; Measuring elapsed time</h3>

<p>Although you can use the regular <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/times.html">times</a>
module to measure elapsed time, to do it properly you really need a monotonic
timer. Such a thing has been added to the standard library recently in the
form of <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/monotimes.html">std/monotimes</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>os</span>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Your new API backend for the jamstack</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><br>
Last month we talked about a new architecture pattern, <a href="https://blog.m3o.com/2020/11/12/netlify-for-the-frontend-micro-for-the-backend.html">Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend</a>. As the frontend has evolved towards being dominated by the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a>, we believe the backend also requires a fundamental shift in it’s design and consumption model.</p>

<p>Netlify, while largely agnostic of framework usage, has promoted decomposition of the traditional stack to something more driven by microservices and APIs. 
<a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a> has long been an advocate for that, both as an <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">open source</a> project and now as a hosted platform called 
<a href="https://blog.m3o.com/2020/11/05/m3o-open-to-the-world.html">M3O</a>.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>

<p>If you want to skip right to getting started head to the <a href="https://m3o.com/signup">m3o.com/signup</a>.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-the-backend">Evolution of the Backend</h2>

<p>But what’s more, we’re seeing a need from the backend to evolve beyond providing traditional infrastructure services. It’s no longer enough to just focus on
authentication, configuration, storage, hosting, etc. What we really need is higher level APIs that provide business level value.</p>

<p>The most prime examples are Stripe, Twilio, Sengrid and Segment. Who focus on APIs for finance, communications and analytics. AWS, Google and others are providing 
coverage for infra level APIs.</p>

<p>What we really need is the next layer of abstraction. We need the building blocks for new types of APIs and services. Micro acts as a platform for these 
services and now we want to move into offering the next level of value add services.</p>

<p>What’s clear when working with microservices is that there’s an ability to decompose systems into smaller domain specific reusable services and then aggregate back 
up into many forms as value add services, products and then businesses.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/building-blocks.png">
</center>

<p>As you can see in this image and probably from common experience, most businesses are composed of the same generic building blocks from the infrastructure all the 
way up. It’s only when we get to the business specific requirements that we need our own services to handle that logic.</p>

<p>It’s insane that most of us continue to build the same systems on the backend over and over rather than reusing and building on the foundations of each others 
work. GitHub enabled this for open source at an accelerated pace but we’ve yet to see the same emerge for business logic, services and APIs.</p>

<p>It’s now our goal to facilitate this with a single unified platform and reusable services.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-micro-services">Introducing Micro Services</h2>

<p>Today we’re unveiling <a href="https://github.com/micro/services"><strong>Micro Services</strong></a>, a set of reusable building block services which can be used on the Micro Platform 
whether you’re self hosting the <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">open source</a> project or using our managed platform <a href="https://m3o.com/">M3O</a>.</p>

<p>Browse directly to <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a> if you want to read through the code or kick the tyres locally.</p>

<center>

<h3 id="services-included">Services Included</h3>

<p>We’re including 10 services from the get go (available in <a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Helloworld</strong> - The canonical helloworld to kick the tyres</li>
  <li><strong>Chat</strong> - Messaging as an api to embed anywhere</li>
  <li><strong>Posts</strong> - The foundation for a headless CMS</li>
  <li><strong>Comments</strong> - Add comments to posts or replies to your app</li>
  <li><strong>Tags</strong> - Categorise your posts for quick searching</li>
  <li><strong>Feeds</strong> - Crawl and index RSS feeds into your posts service</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong> - Realtime gps point location tracking and search</li>
  <li><strong>Messages</strong> - An inbox for private messages and related</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Simple todo notes, lists, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Users</strong> - User management and authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above services are available to explore and deploy when logged in on <a href="https://web.m3o.com/">web.m3o.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-on-the-web">Getting Started on the Web</h2>

<p>As part of this announcement we’re releasing our new Web UI to quickly get up and running.</p>

<p>Head to <a href="https://m3o.com/signup">m3o.com/signup</a> to get started.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-services">Deploy Services</h3>

<p>When logged in you can head to the <a href="https://web.m3o.com/service/new">new service page</a> to explore and deploy any of the above 
plus any other Micro services you’ve built yourself directly from a public git url.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/new-service.png">
</center>

<h3 id="explore-api-endpoints">Explore API Endpoints</h3>

<p>After selecting and running a service, an instance of it gets deployed to your namespace. Once the service deploys it’s API endpoints can be explored and 
called directly from the web UI along with its running status and logs.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/callendpoint.png">
</center>


<h3 id="embed-services-using-microjs">Embed Services using Micro.JS</h3>

<p>All the services running can also be called from Javascript easily (currently only a vanilla JS client is available, more is coming), using what we call 
<strong>micro.js</strong>. See the embed tab for the code.</p>

<center>
  <img src="https://blog.m3o.com/assets/images/microjs.png">
</center>
<p><br>
Micro.js provides a simple way to call services running on the platform, including handling authentication using a popup for login/registration, 
making it easy to add your micro services anywhere on the web.</p>

<p>For those interested in a typescript implementation of login, signup, user read and token refreshing API calls, the 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/web/blob/main/src/app/user.service.ts">relevant web dashboard code</a> can be useful.</p>

<h2 id="build-your-own">Build Your Own</h2>

<p>While we’re providing some services out of the box, Micro is an all encompassing ecosystem that includes a platform and framework for development 
in Go. We want to encourage everyone to get involved, whether it’s writing services for your own consumption or contributing them back to 
<a href="https://github.com/micro/services">github.com/micro/services</a> for everyone else’s consumption too.</p>

<h2 id="learn-more">Learn More</h2>

<p>To learn more about Micro itself head to open source website <a href="https://micro.mu/">micro.mu</a> or join us in <a href="https://slack.m3o.com/">slack</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Some people are not satisfied with a webcam from their notebook or an old webcam
they bought many years ago.</p>
<p>My brother decided he wants to try streaming. Some people can just do a thing
and other people want to research all the bits and pieces beforehand. Our chat
history is comparable in length to all my other chats combined, so I learned a
lot of it as well. The craft is full with small details and inconveniences.</p>
<p>He found that there are basically no good webcams. A lot of the time an image
quality is meh, and the rare presence of 4k is usually not better than 1080p,
because resolution is not quality. Some camera apparently does upscaling from
1080p to 4k in its driver, indicated by poor quality and high CPU load. He also
has a really good camera, Fujifilm X-T1. It can't be used as a webcam when
connected to a USB port. Usually it's possible to buy an HDMI-to-USB converter,
but his camera can't output a live stream into HDMI, only a recorded video.</p>
<p>So we had an idea — maybe it is possible to create a good webcam
ourselves. Would anybody care? Well, it’s almost 2021 now, streaming is still on
the rise, pandemic is going strong and video meetings are everywhere. People are
willing to spend some money, as indicated by countless videos on YouTube
regarding the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start with defining what is a good webcam.</p>
<p>A good webcam, in my opinion, is a device that provides a decent sound quality,
at least on par with recent MacBooks, and an image quality on par with top
smartphones, such as iPhone 11/12, Huawei P40 Pro, etc. As smartphones have a
good image quality, then we could probably manufacture a webcam from smartphone
parts that are cheap and easily available. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>If you’ve read at least a couple of articles on the topic of video production,
you will know that to make quality content from the technical standpoint you
need three things, in that particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's discuss these properties and later how to manufacture it.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound<a href="#sound" aria-label="Anchor link for: sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If you have a recent MacBook, it provides a decent sound quality with its
three-mic array. I haven't researched it and don’t know much about other
notebooks' audio quality. If you have a desktop PC, you have to have some
external mic anyway.</p>
<p>If the web camera has shitty audio quality, you’ll have to buy additional
gear. When I researched the topic, one of the recently released webcams
(available from October 2020) with RRP of $180 was producing a sound as if a
person sits in a big plastic barrel with a closed lid. Their voice was very
muffled with lots of resonant rattles. That level of quality wasn’t acceptable
10 years ago, how this piece of gear could have been produced in 2020 escapes my
understanding.</p>
<p>There are many good enough USB mics for $50+, you also can buy a great XLR
microphone for $100, but then you’ll need an external sound card with phantom
power supply. A decent one can easily cost you $200.</p>
<p>With almost any of these options you’ll have to install and configure some
software that will provide sound level compression, noise suppression (because
your notebook fans are spinning like hell) and won’t produce clicks in the
process.</p>
<p>I would like my webcam to do this by itself, no rattling, minimized echo, etc.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light<a href="#light" aria-label="Anchor link for: light">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A lot of what makes a picture great comes from lighting the scene in a correct way.</p>
<p>The simplest thing is to sit in a room so the window is in front of you and the
Sun isn’t shining into a lens from behind your shoulder.</p>
<p>Webcam cannot provide decent lighting capabilities by itself, so I won’t spend
much time here. There is a <a href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo/RZ19-02320100-R3M1">webcam by
Razer</a>
with a built-in LED circle, but it’s necessarily small, always shines from a
webcam direction and is mostly a gimmick.</p>
<p>We can rely somewhat on the good sensor here. If it provides good dynamic range,
HDR capabilities and good low-light performance, then a patch of sunlight on the
wall won't turn everything else black, or a poorly lit room won't turn into a
gray noisy picture with a bleak silhouette.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality<a href="#image-quality" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-quality">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to get a good lens and image sensor into a notebook lid, because
lids are very thin. They’re often something like 4 mm thick all together, and
there is no escaping physics. Of course, it's possible to put a webcam into a
thick part below the lid, but then it'll be useful for expressing anger at our
colleagues with wide-open nostrils and not much else.</p>
<p>Maybe some crazy engineer in the future will develop an array of small sensors
with an array of tiny lenses and somehow combine all that into a good image
quality, but we don't have this tech yet. Any smartphone with a good camera has
that camera with an ugly protruding lens as a thickest part of the phone.</p>
<p>So, if you want something better than a notebook's webcam, you can get some
Logitech webcam with an image quality going back to 2012. It’s still better than
a laptop, but nowhere close to current smartphones.</p>
<p>What if you want better still? The next option is to install an app on the phone
and use it as a webcam. This gives a very good image quality, but it’s very
inconvenient and in some applications doesn’t work at all. For some reason it
isn’t always presented in applications as an option when choosing a video
source.</p>
<p>I don’t want to constantly attach, detach, charge my phone and tune the position of
a small tripod. What’s the next option?</p>
<p>The next option is to just buy a mirrorless photo-camera with a big fat 4/3” or
even APS-C sensor. It will cost $500+ for a new one (you can buy used for
cheaper). You will also need some gear to hold the camera in place, as it won’t
just rest on the top of the screen like a regular webcam. You also need an
HDMI-to-USB video grabber, and you need to be sure that the camera you buy can
output full resolution live onto that HDMI. Also make sure that it's possible to
turn off all on-screen info like <code>1/100s F3.5 ISO 800</code>, which is useful when
you're shooting photos and videos through viewfinder, but not so much when
you're in a video meeting. This feature is called "Clean HDMI".</p>
<p>Of course, you will have a lot of control over the whole stuff — set a
diaphragm, get good bokeh, set ISO, set white balance, etc. Do you actually need
it? Well, some of you do, and a lot of you do not. I learned all that stuff when
I was 16, but now I’m pretty happy with how my phone chooses everything for me
and just does great photos.</p>
<p>All that sounds pretty involved, isn’t it? It is a lot of time to research what
you need, how to set it all up, and a lot of money too.</p>
<h3 id="manufacturing-it">Manufacturing it<a href="#manufacturing-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: manufacturing-it">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So there is a market gap between so-so webcams for $100-200 and a full-blown
setup with a mirrorless camera, an external mic and lighting panels that will
cost almost a grand or two, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>I thought that it is a good idea to create an "upmarket" webcam for $250-300
that will provide good audio and video quality, on par with current smartphones,
actually using the same parts. As smartphones are made in tens of millions, all
relevant parts should be cheap and easily obtainable.</p>
<p>I quickly contacted some people who could help me do the project — firmware
engineer, electric engineer and a company that does mechanical design.</p>
<p>What features are needed for a good webcam for streamers and video meetings?
Audio: good parts (mics and ADC), good mechanical design and assembly (so
nothing would rattle), and some post-processing. We certainly want some
beam-forming capabilities to be able to focus on the person in front of the
webcam, so we will need more than one microphone, maybe up to 4. These parts are
easy to obtain, there are many in stock, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>Even if I think that 4k is not needed, I’m pretty sure it’s really a requirement
to have in an upmarket webcam, as it will be really hard to sell a pricey webcam
that can only do 1080p.</p>
<p>Also would be very nice to have some neural network inference on the chip, so we
can run some AI stuff directly on the webcam without bothering a user’s computer
that can be busy with other things.</p>
<p>I easily found a three-piece assembly for the iPhone 11 Pro for fifty bucks,
two-piece from a Huawei P40 Pro for twenty five and a one-piece from P40 Lite for
ten dollars. That’s with a lens, and bought in retail. Does it mean it costs
peanuts (less than $5 for a sensor) to buy in bulk to produce my own webcam?
Well... Maybe. I can’t just go and buy a couple thousands of these sensors. I’m
pretty sure I can buy a couple thousands of replacement parts for phones, but
sensors themselves are not sold freely. It's easy to buy some "random" sensor
that was around for years and most certainly has "meh" quality by today's
standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and
low-light performance.</p>
<p>I wrote to several vendors asking them what are the prices and conditions, and
basically their answer is either silence or “we’ll sell it if you will buy
hundreds of thousands per year”.</p>
<p>I've found suitable System-on-Chips, and it's the same — if we want to have
hardware 4k encoder, it's either "sorry, it was a demo part and we don't do it",
or "we have limited support capabilities, so we can only sell if you will buy
hundreds of thousands, maybe you want some SoMs from our partners?". It is
actually possible to buy System-on-Modules even in very small quantities, but
it's going to be pretty expensive and will be good for a prototype, but for
production it will blow past our budget. System-on-Module will cost almost the
same as the web camera itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and a lead time (from order to shipment) is systematically 16+ weeks. It
means they have no stock and will place an order at semiconductor foundry, have
it produced, packaged and sent to customer. Swiftly.</p>
<p>It means I cannot just build five hundred webcams, see how good are they selling
and build a couple thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a plastic injection step that requires upfront investment to
manufacture molds, and of course design and engineering costs. All combined it
was tens of thousands …</p></section></div>

<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/21/a-to-do-app-that-fits-in-a-single-tweet/">post</a> was an awesome one, I learned a lot in JavaScript and and I was happy to see people doing what I thought impossible. Writing a simple todo app within 280 chars, in plain js.</p>
<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login. </strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a company, you need to push to gain as much users as possible on their mobile devices, that’s the best way to track, to send notifications and keep you hooked and keep coming back. If I had a company like Reddit I might have done the same.</p>
<p>But for blocking users from their mobile devices, a service they once offered is a very dark pattern, instead what they should do is introduce some awesome features that will make the users download the app by themselves so they can enjoy those features. Not forcing the app though their throats.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced a similar experience on Reddit mobile?</p>
<p><em>Only after writing the and checking the screenshot again made me see that they allow you to see the subreddit by logging in. But that is obscured and they intend to push users to download the app.</em></p>

<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

            <h3>My Engineering Axioms</h3>

            <p>A few months back I gave a talk in which I shared a list of my personal engineering axioms – things that, over the years, I've come to think of as generally true and useful to have in mind when writing code, building things, and working with others.</p>

            <p>Axiom is a fancy word, but popping a few layers off the etymology stack we arrive neatly at the ancient Greek word <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1">ἀξίωμα</a>, or "that which is thought fit or worthy". I like that, and consider each item on the list at least worthy of consideration.</p>

            <p>Of course they're <b>my</b> engineering axioms – things I believe to be useful based on my own experience. Your experience may well differ. Maybe you already knew about <a href="https://martinrue.com/zzuy-a-lesson-in-perseverance/">zero termination</a>, or have better tools than <a href="https://martinrue.com/give-yourself-more-playtime/">scissors to remove bugs</a> from your programs.</p>

            <p>In any case, I thought it would be fun to share the list here, with a few brief clarifications. Some things are pretty unsurprising, but hopefully others will generate some provocative thoughts and/or interesting disagreements.</p>

            <h4>1. Change is constant.</h4>

            <p>This one shouldn't be too controversial. Almost everything is always changing, including the rate of change itself. We need to acknowledge not only that our ability to respond to change is crucial, but that how well we do it (time, cost, quality, reliability) is often a dimension of our competitiveness.</p>

            <h4>2. Your product is an asset, but code is a liability.</h4>

            <p>Your product solves your customer's problem(s), and therefore is your asset. The code itself is the cost of creating the asset. The more code you have, the more it needs to be read, tested, changed, and understood. This is especially relevant when you consider axiom 1. Accept new code (and dependency on external code) conservatively. The best code is code you don't have to write.</p>

            <h4>3. Duplication is less costly than premature abstraction.</h4>

            <p>Until you have a high degree of confidence that your abstraction is going to pay for itself because it solves a real, abstract problem you really do have, don't do it. Wait and learn more. Until then, repeating code can help avoid dependency, which itself makes the code easier to change independently or delete. A premature abstraction creates complexity through dependency and indirection, and can become a bottleneck to your ability to respond to change.</p>

            <h4>4. Code should be easy to delete.</h4>

            <p>Write code to be removable, which in large part is the same as saying "decoupled". For sure not all code needs to be similarly removable, but minimising dependencies, having clear boundaries via well-defined interfaces, and having a thoughtful overall system design allows parts to be removed/changed more easily. I once heard someone use the expression "code spent", as an alternative to "code written" and I love that. I like the implication that removing code is reducing future cost.</p>

            <h4>5. Existing code exerts a powerful influence.</h4>

            <p>The very fact it's there suggests it's correct and necessary. Hopefully it is, but not always. We need to maintain both the confidence to change it, and the ability to reason about whether we should. Don't let the existence of code itself create doubt that it can't be removed. As per axiom 4, it should be easy to remove, and the system design should be good enough to enable us to understand whether we still need it.</p>

            <h4>6. Accidental complexity is one of the biggest risks.</h4>

            <p>Accidental complexity is complexity that can be avoided, and occurs due to things like poor design, bad decisions, and not prioritising an appropriate level of simplicity within a system. If simplicity is not a goal, accidental complexity is more likely to occur as a system grows, and will gradually negatively affect almost everything from changing the system to even being able to understand it. The 2006 paper <a href="http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf">Out of the Tar Pit</a> is a worthwhile read on this subject.</p>

            <h4>7. Technical excellence can be shadowed by bad personal skills.</h4>

            <p>Unless you're working completely alone, it's not just your ability to solve technical problems, to write good code, etc, that matters. To the contrary, they matter even less if you make the people around you unhappy and less productive. Just like learning to write good code, you have to learn "to people" good as well. Empathy is a big part of this, as is recognising that people are different – be caring, be understanding, help others and ask for help yourself, be nice. Be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>8. You are not your code. Be kind to the coder, not to the code.</h4>

            <p>Code is merely a moment in time that captured what we thought we knew about something. It's not you. You may have wrote it, but since that moment (even if it was 3 minutes ago) you've grown, but the code has not. A conversation about code, good or bad, should never be personal. Keep it professional. Talk about the code, or about the problem, but don't make it about the person who wrote it. Use "we" instead of "you". Sometimes I try to pretend I wrote the code someone else wrote, which helps me avoid accidentally sounding personal.</p>

            <h4>9. Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.</h4>

            <p>We all start somewhere, and the journey is a lot more joyful when you're surrounded by patient people who want you to succeed, rather than those who make you feel like you don't belong. If you struggle with this, it may be helpful to remember that the newbie programmer almost certainly does something better than you do – perhaps they're fluent in another language, or cook amazingly, or play a sport. Just imagine yourself in the reverse role. How would you like them to treat you, the total newbie? Again: be an engineer others want to work with.</p>

            <h4>10. The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</h4>

            <p>Knowledge and understanding of the problem, the domain, the customer, are all far more important than whatever the first 3 letters on your business card are. <a href="https://youtu.be/cISYzA36-ZY?t=85">Even if it does have a watermark</a>. Understand how something works from first principles, build a solid understanding, and authority will follow.</p>

            <h4>11. Teaching is a form of learning in disguise.</h4>

            <p>If you think you know something, try teaching it. Often the very act of trying to explain what you know to someone else forces you to formalise your own thoughts much more clearly. Writing things down seems to have a similar effect. I've lost count of the number of times I've begun explaining something only to find I don't quite understand it as well as I thought.</p>

            <h4>12. Lift the skills of people around you, not just yourself.</h4>

            <p>A great team is never a great because of one amazing person. It's a great team because everyone challenges each other and everybody grows together. When you learn something cool, share it – help the people around you get better. As they do the same, everybody benefits and nobody gets left behind. It's also far more fun. Secondary benefit: axiom 11.</p>

            <h4>13. The longer you wait the more you'll know.</h4>

            <p>I'm still learning this and trying hard to avoid my almost default desire to decide quickly. The truth is, the longer you delay non-essential decisions the more information you'll have to lean on when the time comes to make it. Of course you can't always procrastinate a decision, but often you can, and as a minimum you should at least consider whether not knowing the answer right now is actually OK.</p>

            <h4>14. A good type system is worth its weight plus some.</h4>

            <p>Having gone backwards and forwards through various static and dynamic languages over my career, I'm currently of the opinion that a good type system is worth its overhead. A good type system shouldn't carry all that much overhead. If the type system is designed well, it can almost feel like a dynamic language (via features like inference and flow analysis) while removing a whole class of issues that the compiler can handle far better and quicker than you can. Developments like ownership in Rust are a nice example of how this has gone even further than people would have imagined years back.</p>

            <h4>15. The right team of people trumps everything else.</h4>

            <p>Having a team of people who just want to work together and build great things makes a lot of other problems easier to deal with. The word "right" here is highly subjective and contextual, but at least anecdotally, empathy, respect, and friendship have been recurring elements of great teams I've been part of.</p>

            <h4>16. Stick to boring technology, unless there's a good reason not to.</h4>

            <p>Boring tech is often older and better understood. There's battle-hardened experience of how to use it effectively, better understanding of its failure modes, and it's easier to find people and resources on how to best apply it. I really like Dan McKinley's idea of <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation tokens</a>. You only get 3. Use them to adopt or build brand new stuff – ideally stuff that will make you better at your core competency – but any more than 3 and the risk of never reaching stability/maturity starts to grow.</p>

            <h4>17. Have the smallest team possible, but no smaller. Grow it carefully.</h4>

            <p>A play on a well-known quote, and your mileage may vary on this one. In my career so far, I've reliably seen smaller teams be more effective than larger ones. There's a balance to be found, for sure, which depends on the magnitude and complexity of the problem you're solving. That said, smaller teams benefit from less communication overhead, less room for miscommunication, and more space for everyone's voice to be heard. In a smaller team, it also feels more personal, and I feel more responsible, and I like that.</p>

            <h4>18. Rest.</h4>

            <p>I'm happy to see the gradual de-sexification of …</p></article></div>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

		<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>13</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s not a clickbait title, but I understand why it looks that way.</p>



<p>I’ve made my thoughts about the 10x developer trope <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/06/listening-7-deliberate-appreciation/">extremely clear</a>. I think that someone who produces 10x as much code as someone else has left a wake of destruction that will slow down other developers. I don’t think 10x counts if you achieve it by slowing down everyone else. I think 10x has to take into account how you impact other people.</p>



<p>And <em>that,</em> paradoxically, suggests a path for how to become a 10x developer: empower and enable other people such that nine additional developers’ worth of work gets done. You can do that by making nine other developers’ workflows 2x smoother. You can also do that by making 18 other developers’ workflows 50% smoother, or 90 other developers’ workflows 10% smoother.</p>

<p>At some point, your biggest gains in your X are gonna be in improving the ecosystem for other developers. On occasions when I have succeeded at that, from <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">driving workplace changes</a> to <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/category/teaching/">teaching computer science classes</a>, I have noticed that I’m using one or more of three techniques. So I thought I’d list them here.</p>



<h3>First, establish the motivation.</h3>



<p>Learning is work. Sometimes, it’s boring or difficult work. Folks don’t undertake that kind of work unless they understand why they should. That’s not as simple as <em>telling</em> them why. Understanding comes from engaging with the material.</p>



<p>Suppose you want to make a major code change that affects your team’s workflow. If you blaze forward and do that without buy-in, the team will resent it (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/02/25/how-to-socialize-big-changes-at-work-part-1-start-at-the-grassroots-level/">as we’ve discussed in more detail here</a>). So I recommend starting with individual conversations about the reasons for the change:</p>



<blockquote><p><span>What is bothering you about your team’s current workflow that motivates you to push your solution? Are you annoyed at having to write the same code over and over in different places? Are you tired of trying to poke your way around an opaque tool? Are you losing track of things that cost you time and money? Before you&nbsp;</span><em>push</em><span>&nbsp;your solution,&nbsp;</span><em>pull</em><span>&nbsp;your coworkers to it by making sure they feel the pain that you feel.</span></p><p>Before I do a major refactor, I’ll deliberately pair program with key people on my team on the kind of problems that my refactor would solve. I want them to experience the pain firsthand; I want to hear them say ‘oh my&nbsp;<em>god&nbsp;</em>this is annoying.’ After I have that admission of pain from a critical mass of people on my team, I’ll propose my solution, and I’ll offer to spearhead the refactor. I will craft a concise explanation of how our workflow changes after the refactor, and I’ll point out why I think the new way is nicer for us than the way we’re doing it now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ‘negative testimonials’ about the old way, which I can whip out to capture the attention and agreement of others on my team. This approach allows me to muster support for my refactor and then, in spearheading the refactor, look like I’m taking one for the team.</p><p>Imagine the same scenario, same refactor, but instead of socializing my solution, I go off on my own, do the refactor, and push. My team didn’t understand the pain that the refactor solved, so all they’re seeing is the pain of learning the&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;way to do things. To them, it looks like I made a unilateral decision that screwed them over—the&nbsp;<em>opposite</em>&nbsp;of what a team player would do. Keep in mind, in both circumstances, I wrote the&nbsp;<em>same code</em>. The only difference is how I introduced it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In effect, even the right code changes need to be <em>sold</em>. </p>



<p>How do we know what the right code changes are? This one is tricky, but one guiding principle has helped me out a lot:</p>



<h3>Look for bonehead solutions to convoluted technical issues.</h3>



<p>Michael Feathers talks a great deal about technical simplification options in his various discussions on edge-free programming (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">here’s a more detailed look at some of those principles)</a>. But for exemplary purposes, here are a few simple solutions to complex problems that I’m especially proud of:</p>



<ul><li>I solved a thorny issue with a sometimes camouflaged, sometimes unreliable delete button by ripping it out (<a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/mobile/pull/345">Here’s the PR if you want more details</a>)</li><li>I resolved the issue of a laggy metronome in React-Native, where computationally expensive operations can result in delays for scheduled tasks. The app happened to also need to play back tracks at various multiples of their original speed. So I recorded a sound file of a metronome at 120 BPM, calculated what speed to play it by dividing the BPM the musician requested by 120, and wrote one method that shelled out to <code>expo-av</code> to play accurate-to-tempo sound files for both the metronome and the backtracks.</li><li>I resolved an issue of regulating how often a person should be allowed to log their mood by realizing the issue was fake (assumed foil to “let’s make sure they log it at least this often”) and letting them log as often as they want (<a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/05/28/lessons-from-space-edge-free-programming/">more details here</a>).</li></ul>



<p>Each of these solutions made the code cleaner and eliminated<em> </em>multiple problems with the product. But they were not genius solutions. In fact, they were easy to miss precisely because complex problems don’t scream “I have a bonehead solution.”</p>


	
	


<p><strong>One drawback: </strong>the tech industry generally rewards churning out tons of code <em>over</em> elegant solutions. Chen Lin recently <a href="https://twitter.com/votecapgood/status/1337920511095918592">tweeted about</a> his experience with this at Uber. Chen is responding to <a href="https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1337552024821510144">this commentary</a>, which starts out salty but goes on to articulate a rarely-discussed element of how the tech industry functions: tech executives <em>have</em> to make their work appear innovative in order to secure VC funding. So they’re forced to artificially “make it innovative” by filing patents or hopping on the latest trends. In the case of Uber and iOS development, that imperative <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">burned them badly</a>.</p>



<p>Academia is similar: <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/watt-jeremy.html">Dr. Jeremy Watt</a>, author of <em><a href="https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined">Machine Learning Refined</a></em>, articulates how academics <em>have</em> to make their work appear novel in order to get published, and they have to get published to keep their jobs, so they’re forced to artificially differentiate similar concepts—to convolute rather than simplify.</p>



<p>There’s a great <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1027552576454021120">explanation from Mekka Okereke</a> about how to counteract some of this as an engineer. It shares a lot with our “first establish the motivation” approach—namely, by starting from the <em>problem</em>, not the solution.</p>



<p><strong>Also, a giant caveat: </strong>This solution is not always there. Sometimes the solution just has to be clever, or complicated, or messy. Sadly I can’t give you an ironclad heuristic for how to find them or how to confirm their existence. I can tell you this: in most cases where I have found them, I have found them by popping <em>up</em> a level from the implementation level to the design level. </p>



<p>Also, this recommendation applies specifically to technical solutions: it does not apply, for example, to racism or fascism. The problems we’re talking about here are de facto circumscribed by the scope of an application. When we’re talking about a generational cultural, political, and structural phenomenon, “just rip out X” doesn’t work.</p>

										<figcaption>Nor does one simply solve [insert insidious social issue here].</figcaption>
					</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>White supremacy culture in tech alone is so insidious and multifaceted that I’ve got <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/02/07/the-price-of-whiteness-in-tech/">an ongoing series</a> about reimagining different parts of tech through a not-white-supremacist lens. But also, listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1249908489826099201">Marco Rogers about this caveat</a>. He knows more things than I do.</p>



<p>ANYWAY, anyway, anyway. </p>



<p>So we’ve talked about selling our changes, and we’ve talked about making changes that reduce the scope of complexity. Naturally, the third thing I find myself doing, is selling new knowledge <em>by</em> reducing the scope of complexity. Here we go:</p>



<h3>Try to spread intuition with as few prerequisites as possible.</h3>



<p>One of my Mobile Software Development students asked me what frameworks he should consider for testing a Python app he’s working on. Here’s what I said:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>In Python there are two leading options: unittest and pytest. Both work fine. When I’m working on teams, I tend to go with pytest because the output is a little nicer.&nbsp;</p><p>But…when I’m&nbsp;<em>teaching</em>&nbsp;Python, I don’t use a testing framework at all. I write methods that call the method I’m testing, and then I use Python’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp" target="_blank">built in assert keyword</a>&nbsp;to check the state of the modified objects or return values. Reason being, I don’t want to jump into the complexity of all the different stuff you can use to test until students understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we test. I try to use the minimum toolset that gets the point across.</p></div></blockquote>



<p><br>One of the big things that educational approaches manage to screw up, in my view, is to introduce prerequisites that make the topic in question <em>harder</em> instead of <em>easier</em>. Fluent Forever founder Gabriel Wyner <a href="https://youtu.be/bPVeIHcgfTs?t=74">articulates how language learning often depends on translation</a>—which is a whole, separate, <em>difficult</em> skill. So when I’m trying to help someone build intuition, I’ll try to eliminate as many dependencies as possible. </p>



<p>I’ll show you an example for teaching testing in Python. I pulled this example out of a notebook that I share with my <a href="https://www.emergentworks.org/">Emergent Works</a> and <a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode">Justice Through Code</a> mentee. She was working on writing a Sudoku solver. Of course, to solve a Sudoku, it helps to know when a Sudoku is solved. </p>



<p>Suppose we start with a similar but simpler puzzle; each row and each column must each possess one copy of each number, like this:</p>



<pre><code>puzzle = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 1, 4, 3],
    [3, 4, 1, 2],
    [4, 3, 2, 1],
]</code></pre>



<p>This is a valid puzzle, albeit smaller than your typical 9 x 9. </p>



<p>It shows a way of <em>representing</em> our problem space—a list of lists. We could make a <code>Puzzle </code>class for this, with all kinds of methods on it. I’m not doing that yet. I’m doing the <em>minimum thing</em> that gets the point across: we need a way to represent our data. Here is a way to represent our data with minimal dependencies and indirection. </p>



<p>We’re gonna do the same thing for the test, no test framework involved (yet!):</p>



<pre><code>def valid_puzzle(puzzle):
    try: 
        # Python is duck-typed, so …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content"><p><code>jq</code> is a command line tool for parsing and modifying JSON. It is useful for extracting relevant bits of information from tools that output JSON, or REST APIs that return JSON. Mac users can install <code>jq</code> using homebrew (<code>brew install jq</code>); see <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/">here</a> for more install options.</p>
<p>In this post we'll examine a couple "real world" examples of using <code>jq</code>, but let's start with...</p>
<h2 id="-code-jq-code-basics">
    <a href="#-code-jq-code-basics">
      
    </a>
    <code>jq</code> Basics</h2><p>The most basic use is just tidying &amp; pretty-printing your JSON:</p>
<pre><code>$ USERX=<span>'{"name":"duchess","city":"Toronto","orders":[{"id":"x","qty":10},{"id":"y","qty":15}]}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>outputs</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"city"</span>: <span>"Toronto"</span>,
  <span>"orders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>10</span>
    },
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
      <span>"qty"</span>: <span>15</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>I like this pretty-printing/formatting capability so much, I have an alias that formats JSON I've copied (in my OS "clipboard") &amp; puts it back in my clipboard:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> jsontidy=<span>"pbpaste | jq '.' | pbcopy"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'.'</code> in the <code>jq '.'</code> command above is the simplest jq "filter." The dot takes the input JSON and outputs it as is. You can read more about filters <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters">here</a>, but the bare minimum to know is that <code>.keyname</code> will filter the result to a property matching that key, and <code>[index]</code> will match an array value at that index:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.name'</span>
<span>"duchess"</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"x"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 10
}
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>[]</code> will match <em>each</em> item in an array:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[].id'</span>
<span>"x"</span>
<span>"y"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Filtering output by value is also handy! Here we use <code>|</code> to output the result of one filter into the input of another filter and <code>select(.qty&gt;10)</code> to select only orders with <code>qty</code> value greater than 10:</p>
<pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>$USERX</span> | jq <span>'.orders[]|select(.qty&gt;10)'</span>
{
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"y"</span>,
  <span>"qty"</span>: 15
}
</code></pre>
<p>One more trick: filtering by <strong>key</strong> name rather than value:</p>
<pre><code>$ ORDER=<span>'{"user_id":123,"user_name":"duchess","order_id":456,"order_status":"sent","vendor_id":789,"vendor_name":"Abe Books"}'</span>
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'.'</span>
{
  <span>"user_id"</span>: 123,
  <span>"user_name"</span>: <span>"duchess"</span>,
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>,
  <span>"vendor_id"</span>: 789,
  <span>"vendor_name"</span>: <span>"Abe Books"</span>
}
$ <span>echo</span> <span>$ORDER</span> | jq <span>'with_entries(select(.key|match("order_")))'</span>
{
  <span>"order_id"</span>: 456,
  <span>"order_status"</span>: <span>"sent"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>(cheat sheet version: <code>with_entries(select(.key|match("KEY FILTER VALUE")))</code>)</p>

    </a>
    A Usecase: Debugging Some Prometheus Metrics</h2><p>I have a prometheus metric showing up locally that doesn't look quite right:</p>
<pre><code>async_task_total{task_name="/Users/duchess/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/web/page/globals.go(189):(*GlobalsPopulator).Populate"} 6
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that the <code>task_name</code> value is a <em>filename</em> is a red flag–<a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels">it's bad to have labels with high cardinality</a> and I'm not sure how many of these there are. I want to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do these <code>task_name</code> labels look like in production?</li>
<li>How many unique values are there for these labels?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
    <a href="#1-getting-the-label-values-in-production">
      
    </a>
    1. Getting the label values in production</h3><p>At my company there is a <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tool we'll call <code>pquery</code> that allows prometheus metrics to be queried from the command line, and it outputs JSON–how conventient! I use this tool in the following examples. You don't have this tool, but fear not: <a href="https://learndevops.substack.com/p/hitting-prometheus-api-with-curl">this wonderful post</a> explains how to query prometheus using <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> which is essentially what <code>pquery</code> does.</p>
<p>Using <code>pquery</code> we can view prometheus metrics from our various clusters. But even if we filter for this exact metric name, it's more data than we can easily look at. We'll use <code>wc -l</code> (wordcount: count lines) to get a rough idea of how much data we're working with:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | wc <span>-l</span>
316117
</code></pre>
<p>316,117 lines of JSON! Oof! We want to iterate over the metrics. But what jq filter do we need to access the array of metrics? I find <code>head</code> useful for figuring out what the top level keys are for a large json structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | head -n 20
{
    <span>"data"</span>: {
        <span>"result"</span>: [
            {
                <span>"metric"</span>: {
                    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,
                    <span>"app"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"instance"</span>: <span>"10.55.55.55:9393"</span>,
                    <span>"job"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-alpha"</span>,
                    <span>"kubernetes_pod_name"</span>: <span>"toodle-app-b446b7ccd-6mls6"</span>,
                    <span>"namespace"</span>: <span>"noweb"</span>,
                    <span>"netpol"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"node_name"</span>: <span>"gke-production-04-3455c6df-j526"</span>,
                    <span>"release"</span>: <span>"toodle-app"</span>,
                    <span>"task_name"</span>: <span>"/charmoffensive/toodle-app/pkg/core/user/user.go(67):GetAccountDetails"</span>
                },
                <span>"value"</span>: [
                    1600981630.344,
                    <span>"2"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>jq 'keys'</code> if you just want the key names:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'keys'</span>
[
  <span>"data"</span>,
  <span>"status"</span>
]
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway we can see from above that <code>.data.result</code> is the "filter" path for the metrics themselves. Let's get the <strong>first result</strong> (<code>[0]</code>) of this array so we can see what one metric looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ pquery <span>'async_task_total'</span> | jq <span>'.data.result[0]'</span>
{
  <span>"metric"</span>: {
    <span>"__name__"</span>: <span>"async_task_total"</span>,

<p>Oops! That <code>app</code> value (<code>toodle-app-alpha</code>) indicates a mistake: I'm only interested in results from the <code>toodle-app</code> app, <em>not</em> from other apps that may also emit this metric (such as the <code>alpha</code> deployment we see here). We could <code>select</code> for this using jq, but <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/"><code>promql</code> already lets us filter by metric names</a> so we'll do that instead: <code>pquery 'async_task_total{app="toodle-app"}'</code>.</p>

<p>📝 Update: It was pointed out to me that as this is a post about <code>jq</code>, not about <code>promql</code>, a <code>jq</code> solution is more appropriate here. I'd originally used promql because it's more efficient to filter on the server when possible. Here's the <code>jq</code> version which uses the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#select(boolean_expression)"><code>select</code> filter</a>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>
We're pretty deep into the whole COVID thing. Where I am in the world, we've been in some variation of lockdown for nine months now. It has meant a lot of changes to my working life, but one of the larger changes to my workflow is that there's no longer a giant whiteboard mounted directly behind me. "Diagrams as code" tools such as <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> and <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a> have gone some way towards filling the void, and I'll examine how far they go in helping me communicate software architecture.
<span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">Why did I like the whiteboard so much?&nbsp;<a href="#why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much" aria-label="Anchor Link For: why-did-i-like-the-whiteboard-so-much">
    
</a></h2>
<p>I think the main thing here is the speed of iteration. When scribbling out an architectural idea, there's usually a bit of back and forth. As long as the diagram is on the whiteboard still, it's easy to erase a few lines here and there and add a few elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the drag and drop functionalities of tools such as <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">LucidChart</a> or <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a> can work for this. With that said, I've suffered the indignity of a stray arrow magnetising itself to the wrong box. It's not the worst thing to happen, nor the hardest thing to fix, but I felt I could go faster. </p>
<h2 id="heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">Heaping praise on diagrams as code<a href="#heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code" aria-label="Anchor Link For: heaping-praise-on-diagrams-as-code">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Being able to delegate how the diagram looks to something else is a boon for my productivity. I know that I can smash out a diagram in Mermaid syntax and the diagram will look pretty good. Don't get me wrong - no graphics design awards are coming my way, but by and large, the diagram is correct and looks clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a simple example that I wrote with Mermaid. Take the following scenario. Service A schedules a task to run at some point with an external service - think of some kind of process that can't be immediately actioned, such as a scheduled task. We're immediately told whether task scheduling worked. If all goes well, the job is eventually delegated to a worker, which carries out it's assigned task. Once that's done, the worker dispatches a webhook notification to service B, allowing us to do whatever further processing logic we need to. Now, I want to describe that using Mermaid syntax. This is what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>sequenceDiagram  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service A  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant External Service Worker  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant Service B  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service A -&gt;&gt;+ External Service: createJob(notifyEndpoint, jobParameters)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service -&gt;&gt;+ Service A: jobScheduleStatus(id, status)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service --&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: startProcessingJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ External Service Worker: processJob(id)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Service Worker -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: dispatchWebhookToNotifyEndpoint(notification)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service B -&gt;&gt;+ Service B: handleWebhook(notification)
</span></code></pre>
<p>And that produces a diagram that looks something like this<sup><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> :</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/practices/fill-void-physical-whiteboard/mermaid-diagram-20201218194918.png" alt="Visual Diagram for the above Mermaid Sequence Diagram code"></p>
<p>The sequence diagram allows me to express this chain of events tersely in code, but richly in the diagram. I'm able to quick and easily represent operational quirks. For instance, the initialisation of job processing is asynchronous. It doesn't occur immediately, but at some unspecified time in the future. In the diagram, I can express that with a dashed line, and in the code for the diagram, that's as easy as <code>--&gt;&gt;+</code>. Sequence numbers make it easy for me to discuss the diagram with other people, as we can refer to steps by their number. And to add them in was as easy as including a parameter when generating the diagram:&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code><span>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"theme"</span><span>: </span><span>"default"</span><span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"sequence"</span><span>: {&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>"showSequenceNumbers"</span><span>: </span><span>true&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now all the example is perhaps not the most powerful use case. It's a little simple, and it's not tricky to put together a diagram that looks like this with a GUI. In reality these diagrams have a fair bit more going on.</p>
<p>But putting it together in code feels a lot faster for me. The diagram is unsullied by my clumsiness at getting arrows to magnetise to the right box in a WSYWIG web GUI. And this whole thing took me two or three minutes to write - I spent more time coming up with the scenario. I can take the generated image and put it in a ticket, or a slack message, and use it as a visual aid for communicating my thought processes.&nbsp;Even though architectures are more complex in reality, I don't feel like a sense of not being able to express them using these tools.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that I'm more likely to be able to evolve this diagram over time. It doesn't rely on me preserving a whiteboard for all eternity. I can come back later, and make a quick tweak or edit, based on feedback or what have you. I write code every day, so as a method of building something - I'm used to it. Should I make a mistake, or if I want to make some tweak somewhere, I can do that without much fuss. I could even commit these into source control if I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to construct diagrams whilst sustaining speed, correctness and clarity are pretty much all I need. If I want to make a particularly pretty diagram (maybe it's for external eyes) I'd use the drag and drop tools. The more complex autogenerated diagrams tend to have a few visual quirks. But where I want the diagram to be evolvable, these tools fill the niche well. The hosted services that provide diagramming as a service see the value in these tools. For example, LucidChart supports its own flavour of syntax, and Draw.IO supports PlantUML and Mermaid syntax.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">But does it replace a whiteboard?<a href="#but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard" aria-label="Anchor Link For: but-does-it-replace-a-whiteboard">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Ish. Scribbling on a whiteboard feels faster still - at least for initial construction. And the back and forth with people when etching on a board feels easier.</p>
<p>But, I've gotten faster generating diagrams from code. The syntax for mermaid and PlantUML is pretty simple and easy to remember after a spot of practice. And in a way, it feels accessible in a different way to a whiteboard. We don't have to be in the same room to collaborate. The escape hatch here is that we can always switch to using the WSYWIG to construct the diagram instead. It's slower, but if someone's not up to speed with the syntax and it's not worth them getting up to speed, it's an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond that, it lets me get a head start on any artefacts we need for documentation. Producing a quick diagram in the planning phases of a ticket that I can evolve later into something more formal is a big win for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Constructing diagrams as code does not replace everything a whiteboard does for me. But it's fast enough, it's easy to get started, and it makes it easy to involve remote people. If everyone knows the syntax, remote collaboration is easy, and you've still got the escape hatch of WSYWIG tools, though they feel slower to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that a quick sequence diagram, to help communicate a mental model of a solution can grease the wheels of progress a great deal.</p>

<p>2020-12-20</p>


<p>About two years ago, I wrote a quite complicated diff tool in Clojure.<br>
It was complicated enough that I struggled to fit the algorithm in my head and the inputs were large enough that I had to make some efforts to improve performance.</p>
<p>About half a year later, I started learning Rust, ported the current state of the Clojure program into Rust, was very happy with the change<sup><a href="#hooked-on-rust">1</a></sup> and continued exclusively with Rust.<br>
While working on that project, I've developed some opinions about the two languages, especially about error handling and performance:</p>
<p>I think that these are areas where Rust excels, while they are among the weaker spots of Clojure<sup><a href="#not-hating-on-clojure">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To put my experience in context:
I had a bit more than one year of experience in Clojure when I moved to Rust.
The diff tool was by far the largest Clojure program I've ever written, and it was only about 3000 lines.<br>
When I started writing Rust, reimplementing the existing Clojure code was among my first Rust code.
I've continued learning Rust since then and have mostly stopped writing Clojure.<br>
If things have changed in Clojure recently, please let me know and I'll update the article.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling"><a href="#error-handling" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling">🔗</a>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The error handling requirements in this project were not very complicated.
All errors just needed to be logged and returned to the user.<br>
The only slightly unusual requirement was that parsing and validation logic should show all errors for each row in both uploaded excel files
(instead of just the first error) so I had to accumulate errors.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-clojure"><a href="#error-handling-in-clojure" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-clojure">🔗</a>Error Handling in Clojure</h3>
<p>Error handling in Clojure is not opinionated.<br>
<a href="https://lispcast.com/clojure-error-messages-accidental/">Similar to error messages</a>
, what error handling idioms exist in Clojure seem to me to be largely accidental or inherited from Java.</p>
<p>The standard library mostly supports <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ex-info">exceptions</a>.<br>
There are some libraries that support returning error values instead of throwing exceptions like the error handling library <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure"><code>failjure</code></a>.<br>
Others, like the parsing library <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse"><code>instaparse</code></a>, return their own custom error values<sup><a href="#insta-result">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I used failjure to help accumulate errors in a nicer way (and because it appealed to my Haskell-influenced taste).</p>
<p>Let's look at a Clojure function from my diff tool that uses <a href="https://github.com/adambard/failjure#attempt-all">attempt-all</a> to parse and validate the input data.
If any errors occur, all errors are aggregated into a string:</p>
<pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>parse
  </span><span>[country-mapping data]
  #_"</span><span>   👇 the attempt-all function exits early 
           if any binding returned a failure</span><span>"

                         list of failures concatenated into a string</span><span>"
                   (</span><span>fail/fail

                                  ::spec/rule</span><span>
                                  parse-result)]
   #_"</span><span>👇 if everything was successful, this is returned</span><span>"

                         failure))))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifier-expression pairs in the square brackets use the same syntax as Clojure's <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/let"><code>let</code>-form</a>
which makes it look familiar.</li>
<li>I can optionally add an error handling function to the very end, which is helpful to, e.g., log the argument of the function, as I did here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't see which functions can actually fail. I have to read them to find out.</li>
<li>Since the Clojure ecosystem doesn't have a uniform error handling style, I have to manually convert exceptions or other errors like <code>instaparse</code> error values to <code>failjure</code> errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
Since Clojure is a Lisp, it's possible to use most kinds of error handling and make it look fine, if you really want to.
The most pragmatic solution in most cases will be to use exceptions.</p>
<p>I found that readability could suffer when using less explicit error handling, especially in a dynamic language.</p>
<p>Due to the freedom of choice in error handling approacher, I was tempted to experiment more than with a more opinionated language.</p>
<h3 id="error-handling-in-rust"><a href="#error-handling-in-rust" aria-label="Anchor link for: error-handling-in-rust">🔗</a>Error handling in Rust</h3>
<p>Rust is quite opinionated about error handling.
The Rust community has worked on developing and improving common idioms, some of which were incorporated into the standard library, thereby improving the baseline error handling.</p>
<p>There's no improvement without change though, and the frequent changes have been a source of complaints.
While backwards compatibility was never broken, people that wanted their code to be idiomatic had to update it anyway.
Old tutorials and guides have therefore also become outdated.</p>
<p>There are lots of good, up-to-date articles about error handling in Rust<sup><a href="#rust-error-handling-links">4</a></sup>, which help learn the current idioms.</p>
<p>In Rust, functions that can error return the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html"><code>Result</code></a> type<sup><a href="#panic-ref">5</a></sup>.<br>
There are several libraries that make creating your own errors or handling errors from libraries easier, but they (mostly) just use the types from the standard library instead of introducing new stuff that's incompatible with the rest of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Let's look at the same function as before, but this time in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub fn </span><span>parse</span><span>(
    </span><span>workbook</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Workbook,
    </span><span>country_mapping</span><span>: CountryMapping,
) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Rule&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = workbook
        .</span><span>worksheet_range</span><span>("</span><span>Rules</span><span>")
        </span><span>// this question mark triggers an early exit
        // there are two because we have an Option
        // containing a Result                    👇
        </span><span>.</span><span>ok_or</span><span>(format_err!("</span><span>Missing Rules sheet</span><span>"))??;
        </span><span>//                               👇
    </span><span>let</span><span> range = </span><span>skip_to_header_row</span><span>(range)?;
    </span><span>let</span><span> parsed = RangeDeserializerBuilder::new()
        .</span><span>has_headers</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)
        .</span><span>from_range</span><span>(&amp;range)
        </span><span>//                                    👇
        </span><span>.</span><span>context</span><span>("</span><span>Failed to read Rules sheet</span><span>")?;
    </span><span>let</span><span> rules = </span><span>collect_errs</span><span>(parsed.</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>parse_result</span><span>| {
        parse_result
            </span><span>// 👇 mapping a lambda over the error value
            </span><span>.</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>e</span><span>| e.</span><span>into</span><span>())
            </span><span>// 👇 this would be called flatMap in some other languages
            </span><span>.</span><span>and_then</span><span>(|</span><span>row</span><span>| row.</span><span>parse</span><span>(&amp;country_mapping))
    }))
    </span><span>// 👇 this converts a list of errors into a single error
    //    containing a string
    </span><span>.</span><span>map_err</span><span>(|</span><span>es</span><span>| {
        format_err!(
            "</span><span>Failed to parse {} rules:</span><span>\n</span><span>{}</span><span>",
            es.</span><span>len</span><span>(),
            </span><span>// 👇 very elegant...
            //    this would just be one .joinToString call in Kotlin
</span><span>            es.</span><span>into_iter</span><span>()
                .</span><span>map</span><span>(|</span><span>e</span><span>| e.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())
                .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()
                .</span><span>join</span><span>("</span><span>\n</span><span>")
        )
   </span><span>// 👇
    </span><span>})?;
    Ok(rules)
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard library, every Rust library I've ever seen and my own application code is always using the same <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a> type, which keeps things pretty compatible.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">The <code>?</code> operator</a> makes fallible functions visible but keeps it succinct.<br>
It also automatically converts error types where possible, which reduces the need for manual type conversion.</li>
<li>The error type I'm using here from the library <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/index.html"><code>anyhow</code></a> supports a <a href="https://docs.rs/anyhow/*/anyhow/trait.Context.html"><code>.context</code></a> method, which gives otherwise unhelpful low-level errors the necessary context.<br>
This is usually done in exception-based languages by catching, wrapping and rethrowing, but this looks a lot more pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not so nice things about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to keep the error types compatible, which I accomplish in this case by not distinguishing between different error types at all<sup><a href="#anyhow-usecase">6</a></sup>.<br>
I still have to return a single error value, which means I have to manually and verbosely convert the list of errors into a single one - in this case a newline-delimited string.</li>
<li>If I want to log something when this entire function returns an error or add some <code>.context</code> to it, I would like to have the equivalent of a <code>try/catch</code>-block around the entire function body.<br>
This doesn't exist yet<sup><a href="#try-blocks">7</a></sup>, the current best practice seems to be do move the entire body into an inner function or lambda.</li>
</ul>
<p>My verdict is:<br>
In Rust, you will use the <code>Result</code> type and you will like it<sup><a href="#and-you'll-like-it">8</a></sup>.<br>
The main design decisions are whether you use some of the helper libraries and how you design your error types.</p>
<p>Designing the error types can be a challenge though, especially because it's a bit different than designing e.g. Java exception hierarchies.<br>
I was lucky that keeping up to date with the evolving error handling idioms wasn't too hard for me as I was not under time pressure and often worked in my spare time with learning as my primary objective.
It might have been painful for teams maintaining bigger production systems.<br>
The large number of error handling tutorials and articles should hopefully make it easier to learn now than it was a few years ago.</p>
<p>The learning curve aside:
To me, Rust's error handling feels like part of the secret sauce that makes it the most promising language for correctness that I know of.</p>
<h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance" aria-label="Anchor link for: performance">🔗</a>Performance</h2>
<p>The part of the program that caused performance issues was the diff algorithm and, to a slightly lesser extent, a data normalization step before that.<br>
The type of performance problems I had were mostly being CPU bound, having to generate and compare a lot of temporary data.
The large amount of data also often caused memory issues in both languages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h4>From training to deployment with Metaflow and Cortex</h4></p><div content-type="article"><p>If we were to design an optimal machine learning pipeline, it would be:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scalable</strong>. As workloads increased, it would scale up without issue.</li><li><strong>Reproducible</strong>. We would be able to draw a line from any model to its data.</li><li><strong>Configurable</strong>. It wouldn’t lock us into particular frameworks or tools.</li></ul><p>Typically, pipelines will tradeoff in at least one of these areas. A pipeline might be scalable, but will rely on a platform that puts limits on data scientists. Or, a pipeline will be completely configurable, but will also be glued together by a mess of ad hoc code and will be impossible to reproduce.</p><p>In this piece, I want to introduce a way to build this kind of ideal pipeline without any tradeoffs. To do this, we’ll be using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank">Metaflow, the open source data science framework from Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">Cortex, our open source deployment platform for machine learning</a>. </p><p>Let’s start by defining our pipeline.</p><h3>Defining a pipeline in Metaflow</h3><p>Metaflow is a data science framework that provides a single API for managing different pieces of the infrastructure stack. It places an emphasis on scalability, reproducibility, and usability.</p><div><p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XV5VGddmP24" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></div><p>At a high level, Metaflow allows us to define pipelines as DAGs, called “flows,” in which data undergoes a sequence of transformations called ”steps.” These steps persist transformed data as “data artifacts,” which are accessible by subsequent steps throughout the flow. </p><p>For example, say we had a training flow that loaded data (probably produced by another flow), trained multiple models with different strategies, evaluated the different models, and saved the top performer:</p><p>This is just a snapshot of our full pipeline, which I’ll be adding to in the next section, but even with just this snippet we have a repeatable training pipeline that can scale to run on many machines. We also have, thanks to Metaflow’s Client API, a way to version, audit, and reproduce these training runs.</p><p>For example, to instantiate a given step from a previous flow, we can simply pass in the flow name, run id, and step name to the Metaflow Client:</p><p>To access an artifact from a particular run, the logic is very similar:</p><p>This means that every time a flow is executed, Metaflow automatically versions and records it using a standard taxonomy. As a result, we can trace any given model’s lineage from raw data to final export. </p><p>There is much more to Metaflow, and I’d encourage you to check out their <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">documentation</a> to learn more, but as an introduction, this should serve to get us started. </p><p>Now, let’s talk a bit about triggering deployments in Metaflow.</p><h3>Deploying models with Cortex</h3><p>In this section, I’m going to take our training flow from before and add a step for deploying our model as a production API on AWS. To do this, we’re going to use Cortex.</p><p>Cortex is a deployment platform for machine learning. On the surface, it provides simple interfaces for building prediction services, deploying them to production, and managing an inference cluster. </p><p>Under the hood, Cortex automates all of the cloud infrastructure needed for inference—autoscaling, GPU/ASIC support, load balancing, prediction tracking, etc—and implements a automated deployment process in which model serving code is packaged, versioned, and deployed to the cluster.</p><p>We can trigger a deployment using Cortex’s Python client within our training flow like this:</p><p>You’ll notice the client includes a deploy() method, which takes a configuration object for defining our API. This configuration works with the Metaflow client to extract the location of the model, and the metadata of the flow for logging purposes. Now, when we audit our deployments, we can connect it all the way back to the run that produced it, extending our lineage from data to deployment.</p><p>The configuration object also references a predict.py script, which is where the actual prediction service is defined. A Cortex predictor looks like this:</p><p>The structure is very simple. We initialize our model in the init() function, which runs on initial deployment, and we generate predictions in the predict() function. Similar to steps in Metaflow, these Python methods can contain whatever logic you want to implement.</p><p>Now, when we run the flow, the model will be trained, evaluated, and deployed to production with zero downtime or extra configuration needed. </p><p>Because Cortex provides native support for A/B testing and traffic splitting, we can even run complex deployment strategies without breaking Metaflow’s lineage.</p><p>For example, if after selecting a best model, we wanted to test how the model performed in different formats—say ONNX vs TensorFlow—we could export two versions of the model, deploy them both in an A/B test, and log their performance. Because our training flow is connected to our deployment, we can then pass this information back and forth between Cortex and Metaflow without issue.</p><h3>An easier path to production machine learning</h3><p>Over the years, a number of end-to-end data science platforms have been released, and most of them fall into the same traps:</p><ul role="list"><li>Providing a smooth interface, with zero transparency into what’s happening under the hood, killing reproducibility and auditing.</li><li>Solving one part of the stack well, like training, but “bolting on” under-developed solutions for other parts, like deployment.</li><li>Locking data scientists and machine learning engineers into a narrow stack by only supporting specific frameworks and integrations.</li></ul><p>The result is a platform that makes production machine learning easy—if you stay strictly within the confines of the system. When you have a diverse set of problems to solve, however, this is difficult to do.</p><p>Metaflow and Cortex represent a fundamentally different, human-centric approach. The emphasis is not on providing a magic solution to a narrow set of problems, but on providing an easy interface for building solutions to any problem.</p><p>If you’re interested in digging into either platform, check out the links below:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Metaflow documentation: </strong> <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank">https://docs.metaflow.org/</a></li><li><strong>Metaflow GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow</a></li><li><strong>Cortex documentation: </strong><a href="https://docs.cortex.dev/" target="_blank">https://docs.cortex.dev/</a></li><li><strong>Cortex GitHub: </strong><a href="https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex" target="_blank">https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex</a></li></ul><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Commentary: Red Hat has been in hot water about changing the way CentOS operates, but that model looks like the exact right way for open source entrepreneurs to operate.</p><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
<figure><span></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Red Hat switched up CentOS to make it less of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone and more of a feeder project into RHEL (as Fedora was always supposed to be, yet wasn’t). Some people are mad, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-resets-centos-linux-and-users-are-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has written</a> on sister site ZDNet. Some people, like former Disney employee Justin Garrison, <a href="https://twitter.com/rothgar/status/1337818039799070722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">think</a> it sounds perfect (the hipper, slightly edgier version of RHEL). If you’re a billion-dollar company upset that Red Hat appears to be trying to charge for something you value, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/goodbye-centos-hello-rocky-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">founder of CentOS has a new way for you to get something for nothing</a>: Rocky Linux.</p>

<p>But if you’re an open source entrepreneur wondering what this means for you, well, Chef cofounder and System Initiative CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Adam Jacob has you covered</a>. In a series of tweets, he walks through how Red Hat’s CentOS strategy can play out for you. (He should know, as the company he co-founded, Chef, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-chefs-100-open-source-move-is-smart-business/" data-absolute="true">last year open sourced everything</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s observe.</p>
<h2>Open source all the things</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062314357514251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob’s first rule</a>? Open it up. Completely. “If I do an open source strategy for a company ever again, I will own the upstream, it will be fully open source, and I’ll happily collaborate with anyone downstream.” But not just an open upstream–it’s also important to, “Produce a commercial distribution [and c]ollaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062321982758912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">argued</a>.</p>
<p>What does he mean by “upstream” and “downstream”? In open source, think of the <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/993/what-does-upstream-mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">upstream</a> as the parent, the head, the initial open source project. Downstream might be forks or distributions (packaging up of a particular build of the upstream code) of the upstream.</p>
<p>What Red Hat announced was basically that CentOS would move from being downstream to upstream. It becomes a place, as <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062318451068929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">Jacob noted</a>, that others <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">like Facebook</a> can collaborate with Red Hat in a way they simply couldn’t before (as Fedora wasn’t closely enough aligned with RHEL). CentOS as a downstream RHEL community was mostly one of users, of consumers, not of collaborators. It was somewhere to get RHEL, but rebranded CentOS, for free.</p>
<p>As such, Jacob pointed out, “They weren’t invested in it beyond using it.” And when someone removes the downstream they get mad “because it’s like someone threatened the water supply,” <a href="https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1337062319558434822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-absolute="true" data-component="externalLink">he argued</a>. It’s therefore far better to condition people to participate as collaborators with an open source project, and through the commercial distribution to also condition users to become customers, if they want the certified distribution.</p>
<h2>Open source + cloud</h2>
<p>One way that open source companies are doing this model to fantastic effect is by open sourcing their upstream and creating a cloud distribution (read: managed service). A variety of companies have embraced this model to greater or lesser extents.</p>
<p>Yugabyte, for example, ditched its Open Core model a year ago and open sourced 100% of its database code. A year later, CTO Karthik Ranganathan told me in an interview, “It increased our adoption like crazy,” growing the number of Yugabyte clusters 10x, but it also has dramatically accelerated their business without them losing any known pipeline. Could someone take that upstream and create a competitive downstream competitor? Of course. But no one should be able to out-Yugabyte on their home turf.</p>
<p>Or take Redis Labs. The company has fiddled with licensing over the last few years, but has kept core Redis completely open while encouraging a growing community (which includes downstream competitors) to lend a hand to improving the code. While Redis Labs doesn’t publish results, its business is booming, even as 10 or so other companies have created competitive downstream managed service offerings.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Jacob: “Run an open upstream from the jump. Produce a commercial distribution. Collaborate on downstream non-commercial ones, in the open.”</p>
<p>That’s the strategy. That’s the magic. You don’t need to go Open Core or any other permutation of kind-of, sort-of open source. You can open source everything and just ensure you have a rock-solid managed cloud service. This reliance on cloud is what’s driving MongoDB, Confluent, DataStax, Redis Labs, and others to great success. It can be your model, too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Sunday, December 20, 2020</p>
<p>I just finished the implementation of an important feature of Pijul: clones, pushes and pulls on partial repositories. In this post, I explain why this matters.</p>
<h2 id="change-commutation">Change commutation</h2>
<p>Pijul is based on <em>changes</em>, also called <em>patches</em> or <em>diffs</em>.
This doesn’t mean that its only internal datastructure is patches, quite to the contrary: it was only by departing from a patch-only internal representation that we were able to solve the algorithmic challenges inherent to patch-based systems.</p>
<p>However, being change-based does mean that the core operations of Pijul are defined on changes, and that Pijul is designed in such a way that changes satisfy basic intuitive properties, similar to algebraic operations. One basic thing is that applying a change is an <em>associative</em> operation, like matrix multiplication: applying $A$ and $B$ at once, and then later $C$, is the same as applying $A$, and then $B$ and $C$ at once. In matrix multiplication, $(AB)C = A(BC)$. Moreover, in Pijul, all changes are invertible (whereas only some matrices are): for any change $A$, there is an “inverse change” $A^{-1}$ such that applying $A^{-1}$ after $A$ is the same as applying neither. Of course, both $A$ and $A^{-1}$ will appear in the log, but the contents of the repository will be the same as applying neither $A$ nor $A^{-1}$.</p>
<p>There is another property that users want from version control systems, and that is <strong>commutation</strong>.
Matrix multiplication rarely commutes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
In Git, commutation is usually <em>simulated</em> using branches and rebase: indeed, rebasing a branch A on top of another branch B really means commuting the commits of A since the divergence between A and B, and the commits of B since the divergence. However, that commutation isn’t perfect, since the commits must change their hash when rebased.</p>
<p>Things are simpler in Pijul, because any two changes that <em>could have been written independently</em> always commute, meaning that if the two changes could be written without knowledge of each other, they can be applied in any order.</p>
<p>This of course raises a potential concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can apply $A$ and $B$ in any order, how do I know which order is the <strong>right</strong> one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Pijul, this question <strong>does not matter</strong>: both orders will yield <strong>the exact same result</strong>, the only difference is that the log will list the changes in the order in which they were applied. And I’m not saying that it doesn’t matter because I’m careless, but because it truly is the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I disagree: it does matter, I still prefer to have a “<em>linear</em>” order for my changes/commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, everybody wants to see the order of operations in a repository, for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep a record of the operations performed on our repository.</li>
<li>We want to go back in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in fact, Pijul allows you to do exactly that, but in a more rigorous way than Git. Indeed, take the scenario where Alice and Bob work together, Alice makes a change $A$ while Bob makes $B$. When they put their work together, Alice applies Bob’s change, resulting in the log $AB$, while Bob applies Alice’s change, resulting in the log $BA$. In this case, there is no “true” linear history, since they worked on different things, and took different steps at different times. However, both of them want to be able to go back in time, step-by-step, and not just “<em>step-by-step-according-to-Bob’s-order</em>”.</p>
<h2 id="commutation-and-massive-repositories">Commutation and massive repositories</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenge for Pijul up to the recent releases was scalability: even modestly-sized repositories like Pijul’s source code would use a lot of disk space. This was even more disappointing since, as I’m about to explain, commutation was suposed to allow it to scale to gigantic repository sizes… in theory. The same problem also made massive tests impossible, meaning that getting past the “0.x releases” seemed more and more impossible as time passed.</p>
<p>Now that this phase is mostly behind us, the cool bits of the theory finally become practical.</p>
<p>In particular, in Pijul, each change contains a reference to the files it modifies. Note that, because we want operations on repositories (such as renaming files) to commute with edits inside files, we don’t identify files and directories by name, but by a unique identifier made from the hash of the change that introduced that file or directory.</p>
<p>For repositories with multiple projects, this makes it possible to clone and pull just parts of a repository, and work on that part as if we had the entire thing. Indeed, imagine we have a repository with the following log:</p>
<ol>
<li>A, adding file <em>x</em></li>
<li>B, editing <em>x</em></li>
<li>C, adding file <em>y</em></li>
<li>D, adding file <em>z</em></li>
<li>E, renaming <em>x</em> to <em>w</em></li>
<li>F, editing <em>y</em> and <em>z</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All these changes do not necessarily commute; however, since B and C touch completely different files (namely, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>), they could be produced in parallel, and hence they commute. This means that we can pull only the changes related to a specific file, say <em>x</em>, and make the following history: A, B, E<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, any change made on top of that sequence will commute with C, D and F: indeed, if we edit file <em>x</em> again, producing a change G, then since G can be made in parallel to C, D and F, we can push G after any patch that comes after B in that history, for example getting history “ABCDEFG”.</p>
<p>Note that this is done without changing the changes nor their hash.</p>
<h2 id="another-trick-for-large-files">Another trick for large files</h2>
<p>As explained in previous posts on this blog, Pijul changes have a bit more information than diffs, and operate on graphs rather than files. This means that changes can be split into two parts, a short-ish one with a binary specification of the graph operations, and then the new content inserted by the change.</p>
<p>The change format is designed to be downloadable in two stages: one can download the operations without downloading the contents. One issue with this is security: if we don’t download the contents, how can we make sure that the hash is right? This is done by including a hash of the change in the “operations” section of the change, and letting the hash of a change be the hash of the “operations” section.</p>
<p>This makes it possible for someone to make five versions of a large binary file in a day, where each change deletes the entire file, and adds it again, the operation sections only contain the length of the different versions, not the actual bytes. In order to get the latest version of the file, a client will therefore only have to download the latest change completely, and only the operations section of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Note that this makes the following “attack” possible: a server might trick a client into believing that the server has a change with hash $A$, which inserts $n$ bytes into a file, and then another change with hash $B$, deleting all these bytes. When the client downloads $A$ and $B$, it doesn’t need to download the contents. However, if the client later decides to unrecord $B$, the contents of $A$ will have to be downloaded, and the client will be able to tell that the hash of $A$ was incorrect. This should make it impossible to unrecord $B$ without also unrecording $A$. However, if $A$ made other edits, and other changes depend on $A$, this could be problematic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>There is one remaining painpoint for very large repositories, and this is the fact that in order to clone a repository with a very large history, one must download and apply all the changes, one by one. Even though our apply function is quite fast<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, this can still be problematic for dozens or hundreds of thousands of changes.</p>
<p>In my next post, I will talk about a solution to this problem, which I have started to implement.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Matrices that are simultaneously diagonalizable do, for example, but for two arbitrary matrices $A$ and $B$, $AB$ is often different from $BA$. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that in this case, we could also pull A, E, B, since renaming a file commutes with editing it. However, we must start with A, since adding a file could not be possibly done in parallel to editing or renaming it. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The complexity of apply is in $O(|p| |c| \log |H|)$, where $|p|$ is the size of the change, $|c|$ is the size of the largest conflict in which $p$ is involved, and $|H|$ is the number of edits made since the start of the repository. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://transposit.imgix.net/img/2019.12.23a.jpg?auto=format&amp;ch=Width,DPR&amp;q=95&amp;w=800" alt="Picture of fire burning in a fireplace"></p><p>Are you sitting by the fire sipping cocoa, worrying secretly about whether you’ll have to put out an engineering fire any minute?</p><p>If only everyone could enjoy a well-earned break from on call life, the week would be more relaxing, but there is no rest for the technology that keeps our world running. This week certain industries are reaching a holiday high, and DevOps, SREs, and on call engineers everywhere will have to don their invisible superhero capes and keep us humans and our devices connected, just like they always do.</p><p>At Transposit, we know the pain of on call ourselves, and so we’ve banded together to come up with some of our top tips for making holiday on call shifts as painless as possible.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-one%3A">On Call Tip Number One: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-one%3A">#</a></h2><p>Whether on-callers are planning on having a Rockwellian Christmas, lighting the menorah with Bubbe, visiting family abroad, or taking a tropical trip with the two federal holidays padding their vacation request, there is one consistent truth about the holiday week between Christmas and New Years: Mass exodus from the office. So, before we even get into the challenges of answering a page when no one is around to help you, how can you avoid that conundrum in the first place?</p><p>On call engineering managers should be careful to adjust on call schedules so that the same people are not on call during multiple peak times. Which times are most painful are up to the individual, so giving each person the opportunity to sign up for what works for them first is always a best practice. Perhaps someone doesn’t mind being on call Christmas morning, but absolutely can’t do it on New Years Eve. Start by letting people pick what is ideal for them, and then fill in the remaining gaps, being sure not to unduly burden any one member of the team.</p><p>When making the on call schedule, make sure that there are primaries and secondaries who are committed to each shift, since they will likely be working together without quick access to the rest of the team when something goes wrong.</p><p>To reduce the pain further, consider upping on call bonuses for the entire week as an incentive for taking on undesirable shifts, and once everyone is back in the office in January, be sure to acknowledge the on-callers who responded quickly to keep the business running while everyone else was enjoying their time away from work.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-two%3A">On Call Tip Number Two: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-two%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">Communicate early and often, with and without runbooks. <a href="#communicate-early-and-often%2C-with-and-without-runbooks.">#</a></h3><p>Without easy access to the rest of the team, good playbook/runbook documentation during this period is even more important than it is the rest of the year. If your typical on call process involves opening up a collaborative team Slack thread or Jira ticket and then letting various experts or senior SREs weigh in, you might face a rude awakening when your reliable experts are MIA during the holiday week.</p><p>Make sure your runbooks are updated and everyone has easy access to the DevOps systems they need before everyone leaves on vacation, because if on-callers are left to search half-empty wikis by themselves, the speed to resolution is going to be stressful for everyone - engineers, managers, and executives alike.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that primary and secondary on-callers know exactly who they are paired with for a particular shift. Make sure that both are committed to being fully available and sober during their shifts, so that in the absence of the whole team, they are secure in having at least one problem-solving partner.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-three%3A">On Call Tip Number Three: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-three%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="plan-around-potential-travel-problems">Plan around potential travel problems <a href="#plan-around-potential-travel-problems">#</a></h3><p>While it may seem obvious to plan your travel around your on call shifts so that you aren’t in the air while you’re supposed to be available, these days, we sometimes have too much faith in our connectivity during travel. Airports and even some planes have wifi, many airplane seats have built-in electricity and jacks, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Remember, this week is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in the US, so our already strained infrastructure will be at the edge of capacity in the best of circumstances. You won’t be very effective at troubleshooting an outage if you are standing in a 2-hour long airport security line or sitting in a traffic jam on the way up to the mountains. Add unpredictable winter weather to the mix, and we have on call disasters in the making. So, what should on-callers do?</p><p>First, you should plan wider time-frames for travel around your on call shifts to avoid accidentally being unavailable. You also shouldn’t count on access to wifi on your flights (only some planes are equipped, and airlines often shift which plane is flying a certain route based on weather and mechanical issues). Don’t expect access to electricity in the airport to charge your computer or phone, as the high number of travelers may easily keep the charging stations fully occupied, and make sure you have your computer and charger easily accessible, so that if you are forced to gate-check a bag on your crowded flight, you will be sure to keep these precious items on your person.</p><p>Traveling on-callers should also remember that time zones are a thing - your on call planning will need to be adjusted accordingly. If you are the secondary, your primary may be in a different time zone (or vice versa), and you should discuss your plans with them beforehand so that you are prepared for them to be asleep at different hours.</p><p>Finally, if you are traveling anywhere that has inclement weather or otherwise unreliable access to internet, you should have a back-up plan, such as tethering your computer to your phone’s data service to get around unreliable wifi. If you arrive at your destination and realize that you have bad data service, finicky wifi, or (gasp) the possibility of power outages, you should admit your defeat early and find an understanding colleague to take your shift, rather than hoping for the best and leaving any alerts to your back-ups.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-four%3A">On Call Tip Number Four: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-four%3A">#</a></h2><p>We’ve already talked about the importance of secondaries as problem-solving partners, but what about the other, more social challenges of being on call during this time? Let’s say you’re sitting down to a nice family dinner, and, just like you were dreading, there goes your phone dinging with an urgent alert. How are you going to explain this situation to your relatives, who in many cases, don’t really understand what you do?</p><p>This is where a friendly ally can help serve as your secondary within your social situation. If you arm a sibling or supportive partner with talking points to explain why you have to get up from the festive table to crouch frantically over your laptop in the back room, you will be able to focus on troubleshooting without worrying about the familial fallout.</p><h2 id="on-call-tip-number-five%3A">On Call Tip Number Five: <a href="#on-call-tip-number-five%3A">#</a></h2><h3 id="pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">Pat yourself and your team on the back <a href="#pat-yourself-and-your-team-on-the-back">#</a></h3><p>It should go without saying, and so often it does, that there is a reason the world functions so smoothly during this week, despite its unique circumstances. While a lot of the credit is due to excellent engineering and team planning throughout the rest of the year, there are always unanticipated incidents that simply can’t be avoided. That’s why on call shifts, DevOps, and SREs exist in the first place! And so, as we look back on the year, and the incidents resolved during this special last week of 2019, let’s remember to give a shout out to all the engineering heroes who stepped forward to make it happen. Cheers to you!</p></div></div>]]>

December 21, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2019/08/16/getting-started-with-lisp-in-2019">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  It's 2019 and Lisp stories are on fire at HackerNews. While there exist multiple Lisp dialects, Common Lisp is the
  oldest and most mentioned. Thus, if you're looking to get started with programming in Common Lisp, then there are 2
  options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://portacle.github.io/">portacle</a> to get up and running with SBCL + Emacs.</li>
  <li>
    Use
    <a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">roswell</a> to install multiple Lisp implementations + build and bundle
    lisp applications. Roswell installs SBCL by default.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for me, I did not feel like learning a brand new text editor just to get started with Lisp so I went with Roswell.
  Follow the instructions on installing Roswell for your platform. In my case, I decided to install it under
  <code>$HOME/bin</code> on my linux machine via:
</p>

<pre>$ sudo apt install rlwrap
$ mkdir $HOME/bin
$ git clone -b release https://github.com/roswell/roswell.git
$ cd roswell/
$ sh bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/bin
$ make
$ make install</pre>

<p>
  Make sure to add the roswell path to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> (note that roswell installed itself under
  <code>~/bin/bin</code> and if this looks odd to you, install it under <code>$HOME/apps</code> or something of the
  sort):
</p>

<pre>if [ -d "$HOME/bin/bin" ] ; then
  PATH="$HOME/bin/bin:$PATH"
fi</pre>

<p>
  Open a new terminal and setup roswell:
</p>

<pre>$ which ros
/home/xxx/bin/bin/ros
$ ros --version
roswell 19.06.10.100
$ ros setup </pre>

<p>
  We will now setup VSCode to run lisp. First install the
  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mattn.Lisp">vscode-lisp</a> extension. Open a new file
  and type the following in:
</p>

<pre>(defun main ()
  (format t "Hello world"))
</pre>

<p>
  Then <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal">launch a terminal</a> inside VSCode. In
  the terminal run <code>rlwrap ros run</code> to start the REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop). Select the above defined
  function and use the "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" from the Command Palette (F1) to run your code!
  Note that you can exit the REPL via: <code>(SB-EXT:EXIT)</code>. The <code>rlwrap</code> utility remembers previously
  typed commands which makes for a much nicer REPL experience.
</p>

<p>
  What is amazing about Roswell is that is comes with a scripting / build ability that allows you to easily distribute
  your application. To see this in action first create a roswell script via <code>ros init hello-world</code>. Then add
  in the following code so that your script looks like the following:
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh
#|-*- mode:lisp -*-|#
#|
exec ros -Q -- $0 "$@"
|#
(progn ;;init forms
  (ros:ensure-asdf)
  ;;#+quicklisp(ql:quickload '() :silent t)
  )

(defpackage :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541
  (:use :cl))
(in-package :ros.script.hello-world.3774807541)

(defun helloWorld
  ()
  (format t "Hello world")
)

(defun main (&amp;rest argv)
  (declare (ignorable argv))
  (helloWorld))
;;; vim: set ft=lisp lisp:
</pre>

<p>
  We can now simply run this script via <code>ros hello-world.ros</code> but more interestingly, we can actually compile
  a binary via <code>ros build hello-world.ros &amp;&amp; ./hello-world</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly enough, I am not a complete noob to Common Lisp, I actually programmed it 15 years ago during my
  undergrad years. A colleague and I
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/847c726edff337b818ba86914d9e71b6">compared an experimental genetic algorithm against an ant colony optimization algoritm on a path-finding problem</a>. Once I had lisp running I opened up the project and basically executed <code>ants.lisp</code> in the REPL, ran
  <code>(INITIALIZE-ANT-WORLD)</code> followed by <code>(DISPATCH-ANTS)</code> and voila, my ants were able to find
  their food!
</p>

<p>
  No guide to getting started with Lisp would be complete without a list of further reading that will keep you busy for
  the next 100 years so here we go:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A very basic Lisp <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/learn/first-steps">tutorial</a> which also features an excellent
    <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/books/">list</a> of Lisp books
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/3c02f249908494a961ac4b28e33f1ec5">A road to common lisp</a> - Steve Losh's excellent guide to
    getting into Lisp programming. The following is a small snippet of useful information from the post:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Files are files on your hard drive.
      </li>
      <li>Packages are containers of symbols. They are orthogonal to files.</li>
      <li>
        Systems are collections of code, instructions on how to load that code, dependency lists, and metadata. They are
        orthogonal to packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Projects are high-level collections of "stuff" such as code, documentation, maybe some image assets,
        etc. They are (mostly) orthogonal to systems.
      </li>
      <li>Common Lisp itself knows about files and packages.</li>
      <li>ASDF adds systems.</li>
      <li>Quicklisp adds the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    This guide also provides a very nice review of libraries and is definitey worth a read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Another <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/cb5d30e9026cba3d1d0b838611d1624c">article</a> that recommends roswell and provides
    instructions for Atom integration along with project and library management.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Well, that's about it - Lisp is beautiful and I'm off to wrap my head around some 15 year old code that doesn't look
  too bad, go functional programming!

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>Consider the meetup speaker.  She’s had a topic in mind for while, and so when the request went out for speakers, she volunteered.  But that was three months ago, and now the meetup’s only a few weeks away, and she hasn’t even begun.  She starts to outline the talk, but can’t quite figure out where to start.  She can explain all the details easily, but the order in which they should be introduced, the organizing structure of the talk, remains elusive.  Giving a talk about a subject, it turns out, is not the same as having a conversation about it.</p>

<p>Consider the first-time meetup attendee.  He’s been interested in the technology for a few months, but there doesn’t seem to be any guides that help him progress from the ubiquitous “hello world” or “distributed word count” examples to actual, effective production usage.  Maybe, he thinks, there will be some people at the meetup who can guide him through this awkward adolescence.  So after a long day at work, he wanders over to the meetup space, where everyone’s hanging around the open pizza boxes.  A few are eyeing the kegerator in the corner, wondering if it’s off-limits.  He stands next to them and eats his pizza, listening to their conversation, wondering if he should introduce himself or just wait for the talk to begin.</p>

<p>Consider the long-time meetup attendee.  He’s been using the technology for a few years, and wants its adoption to grow, so every month he comes to the meetup, eats the pizza, makes small talk with the other regular attendees, and dutifully listens to the talk.  The talk, unfortunately, is usually either too remedial or focused on something not very relevant to his day-to-day usage.  Also, the talks tend to be scattered, introducing concepts out of order, with lots of mental throat-clearing as the speaker tries to remember what was going through their head when they made the slide.  Usually within ten minutes half the audience is looking at their laptops, with only the occasional glance up to confirm that the talk is, in fact, still going on.  He attends almost every month, and often leaves wondering why he bothers.</p>

<p>In this based-on-a-true-story scenario, everyone’s motivations are good: they want to educate and to learn, to nurture and grow the community, to meet people who share their enthusiasm.  And yet, a typical meetup is at best weakly successful in all of these dimensions.  This is for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Any growing community is at least half-filled with novices.</strong>  Very few assumptions can be made about what vocabulary and concepts are universally understood.  The speaker needs to make a conscious choice to either build up from first principles, greatly delaying the time it takes to get to the actual topic at hand, or leave a significant part of the audience behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Understanding something well enough to use it doesn’t mean you can explain it well.</strong>  We should all aspire to a clarity of understanding that lets us easily explain an idea to people from a variety of backgrounds, but that doesn’t come for free.  Details need to be synthesized into broader concepts, without losing sight of the practical knowledge necessary to apply those concepts.  Unsurprisingly, speakers are often still ascending that learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>The standard lecture format expects and enforces passive participation.</strong> Ostensibly the attendees are making an active choice to learn and grow by attending a meetup, but upon arriving all that’s expected of them is to eat and listen.  Each attendee likely has interests and projects of their own, but unless the talk directly addresses them, any discussion must be crammed into the margins of the meetup - either before, when people are eating and the speaker is fussing with the projector, or after, when the hosts are tidying up and giving not-so-subtle looks to everyone who’s lingering.</li>
</ul>

<p>The lecture format still has value, of course, but much less so than its widespread usage would suggest.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like a State</a>, James Scott contrasts two Ancient Greek words for knowledge, <em>techne</em> and <em>metis</em>.  <em>Techne</em> is universal and timeless: the Pythagorean theorem and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musica_universalis">harmony of the spheres</a>.  <em>Metis</em> is local and contextual: Odysseus infiltrating Troy and escaping the Cyclops.  Our educations are anchored in <em>techne</em> - data structures, algorithms, and exams with objectively correct answers - but upon entering the real world, we find the <em>techne</em> only takes us so far.  The problems we solve are not universal, they’re bounded by the context of our particular domains.  This is fortunate, because needing to solve the general form of every problem we come across would slow our work to a standstill.  However, this means our <em>metis</em> is unavoidably tangled up in the context in which we developed it.</p>

<p>Looking back, leaving the <em>techne</em> of school for the <em>metis</em> of our jobs can feel like a fall from grace.  What was once clear is now hopelessly muddled, littered with a thousand half-remembered details.  The promise of the lecture format is a return to that higher plane, an escape from the endless minutiae that awaits below.  And yet, most of what we’ve learned in our careers is within that minutiae.  There is enormous practical knowledge available at every meetup, and the lecture format uses almost none of it.</p>

<p>And so, at Factual we’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">a Clojure meetup</a> modeled on a different academic tradition: office hours.  At a university, students who have questions about the lecture content or coursework can visit the professor, and have a one-on-one conversation.  This can be enormously freeing for both parties: the student can ask questions without fear of looking stupid or holding up the rest of the class, and the professor can focus on giving an explanation that makes sense to this particular student, rather than the entire class.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every meetup, we give everyone a name tag, and provide a whiteboard with two columns, “teachers” and “students”.  Attendees are encouraged to put their name and interests in both columns.  From there, everyone can eat their food and read the whiteboard, and go in search of someone from the opposite column who shares their interests.  Typically they form groups of two or three, sometimes with a few more people listening in.</p>

<p>We’ve only had three meetups so far, each time with around twenty attendees, but the results have been promising.  It has been especially encouraging seeing novice Clojure users bring in their first project to get a critique of their approaches, and discuss how they can better use Clojure’s core abstractions.  These are precisely the sorts of conversations that create a healthy, growing community.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what the maximum practical size for this sort of meetup is.  Given the small size of each group it may scale fairly well, but at some point it becomes impossible for people to find each other.  Some sort of pre-event registration where people list their interests, and popular topics are assigned a physical location, may offset this.  However, for the vast majority of tech meetups, where the attendees number in the dozens rather than hundreds, this can be an enormously useful and engaging alternative to the lecture format.  We encourage everyone to give it a try.  And if you find yourself in San Francisco and have even a passing interest in Clojure, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/events/181057342/">give us a visit</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Sunday morning while I was scrolling through my Twitter feed one tweet caught my eye,</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaScript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaScript</a> Challenge:</p><p>Can you make a TO-DO app within a single Tweet? (280 chars)</p><p>The app should be able to add tasks, strike-through finished tasks &amp; clear all tasks.</p><p>Any general-purpose library is allowed.<br>Starting HTML body should be empty except the &lt;script&gt;.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#code</a></p></div>— Dumi (@dumindaxsb) <a href="https://twitter.com/dumindaxsb/status/1340539549890404354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>The challenge was to make a todo app that fits in a single tweet, just like any other todo app, you should be able to add or remove tasks and clear the task list. I thought how hard this can get, I thought to myself this is doable just by using plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>So since I don’t have a laptop, what resulted was a whole day of torture having to code though my iPad on codepen.</p>
<h2><strong>Plain JavaScript</strong> </h2>
<p>Soon after I started using plain JavaScript it became obvious that I was not able to make it within one tweet, the DOM manipulation was taking too much characters<em>, document.createElements, document.getElements. </em></p>
<p>It was obvious that was not the right approach.</p>
<h2>Using vue</h2>
<p>Vue framework won’t require any build tools, so I don’t have to go through setting up Webpack,</p>
<p>Also I can easily create the DOM within the script tag using simple HTML. So that will save some characters for me in DOM manipulation.</p>
<p>The first version I made use the <em>method</em> option in Vue app to handle button clicks, the button click event will call the function in methods to add new tasks and clear the task list.</p>
<p>However, I was unable to reduce it to one tweet. Then I went back to in-line functions, the same methods were added to button click events inline and not within the <em>methods</em> section.</p>
<p>Also I had to change buttons to anchor tags, in order to save some characters, and I had to use emojis instead of button text to save some more characters.</p>
<p>I also had to drop few buttons like a button to add a task, and instead I had to go with pressing enter key to add a task instead.</p>
<p>So I made the final version, the JavaScript code looked like this, </p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Then I ran the code through an online JavaScript minifier and then the whole HTML though an HTML minifier, and ended up with this piece of code,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://ruky.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="ed9b9888ad83889599">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input @keyup.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a @click="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a @click="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With my fingers crossed, I copied the code on to Twitter, and guess what it fits perfectly inside a single Tweet.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=<a href="https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ">https://t.co/FY9eWOxLgZ</a>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;var x={data:()=&gt;({t:[],k:""}),template:'&lt;input <a href="https://twitter.com/keyup?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keyup</a>.enter="t.push(k)" v-model="k"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t=[]"&gt;❎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p v-for="(v,i) in t"&gt;&lt;a <a href="https://twitter.com/Click?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@click</a>="t.splice(i,1)"&gt;🅾️&lt;/a&gt;{{v}}&lt;/p&gt;'};Vue.createApp(x).mount("body")&lt;/script&gt;</p>— Rukshan (@JustRuky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustRuky/status/1340862545322762240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>And here is the code in action, <a href="https://jsbin.com/venihiliha/1/edit?html,output">link</a> </p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="rukshn" data-slug-hash="qBaXmpE" data-pen-title="qBaXmpE">
<span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn/pen/qBaXmpE">
qBaXmpE</a> by Rukshan Ranatunge (<a href="https://codepen.io/rukshn">@rukshn</a>)
on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>What I failed to achieve </h2>
<p>The original Tweet says, that the completed tasks should have a strike through.</p>
<p>But because css was costing me too much characters I had to fall back to remove completed tasks instead, but I’m sure someone will figure a solution for that as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think you can save even more characters by using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>, because you have short-codes for DOM elements as well, but I haven’t tried mithril in awhile.</p>
<h4>One last thing</h4>
<p>No I didn’t waste my whole Sunday on this problem, but I had to spend few hours, thinking and trying different versions. </p>
<p>I would have cut back some more time if I had a laptop. Somerimes I feel like buying an old laptop and refurbishing it and installing Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Sunday well spent? Absolutely yes.</p>
<h2>Best answer?</h2>
<p>One thing I love about HN is the fact that there are lot of bright minds out there. Since I posted this on HN I knew it was just a matter of time since someone figures this out.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best answer and also ticks all the boxes, well done.</p>
<pre><code> &lt;script&gt;document.write(`&lt;style&gt;:checked+*{text-decoration:line-through}#t{display:none}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;p id="t"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;div id="f"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.appendChild(t.cloneNode(true)).id=''"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onclick="f.innerHTML=''"&gt;×&lt;/button&gt;`)&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<![CDATA[Modeling TLA+ in Z3Py]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It’s that time of year again where I’m fiddling around with Z3Py. I’m booting it back up because I’m scheduled to do a <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/agenda.html">tutorial on Z3</a> on Feb 3. It’s kind of silly because I probably already have too much content, and the tutorial is aimed at newbies, but there are some fun new things that I’ve learned in the last year I can do in Z3. As one example, it’s not so hard to build a pretty reasonable simulacrum of TLA+ in Z3.</p>

<p><a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> is a modelling/specification language for computational processes. It is particularly useful for modeling concurrency, where our intuitions fail us <a href="http://deadlockempire.github.io/">http://deadlockempire.github.io/</a>. It’s the mind child of Leslie Lamport, the same guy behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTex</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. The language doesn’t aim for deep verification of your actual code as is sometimes the goal with tools like Coq, but because of that it is significantly more lightweight and easy to use. 
The <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox</a> is a freely available IDE and checker to TLA+, but I think it is kind of a neat idea to replicate something in the flavor of TLA+ in all too familiar python. By leveraging Z3, we can get a lot of logical mileage and solver power for free.</p>

<p><a href="https://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial">Z3</a> is an SMT solver. Its input language <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/examples.shtml">smtlib2</a> is a kind of typed first order logic with special support for things like booleans, integers, reals, bitvectors, and algebraic datatypes. You can ask Z3 if propositions are valid, or if not it can provide a counterexample. It works pretty crazy good, especially if you work around its weaknesses (mostly quantifiers and nasty nonlinear stuff). Z3 has top class performance and its <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/namespacez3py.html">python bindings</a> are widely regarded as very good.</p>

<p>The main unusual things TLA brings into play compared to bog standard logics is the primed variables \(x'\), representing the values of variables at the next time step, and some temporal operators like always \(\Box\) and eventually \(\Diamond\).</p>

<p>We could mark primes by creating variables in pairs</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>z3</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>xnxt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ints</span><span>(</span><span>"x x'"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I’ve chosen to mark the prime variables using a special uninterpreted function, which we strip out later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>nxt</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span># next is a special function for generators in python, so we shouldn't use that name
</span>    <span>assert</span> <span>is_const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>decl</span><span>().</span><span>kind</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Z3_OP_UNINTERPRETED</span><span>:</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>()</span>

<p>One breakage here as compared to with TLA+ is the use of types. TLA+ curiously insists on a lack of intrinsic types and argues against them as a foundational feature. Types are instead propositions that are proved in the system. This just is really not convenient for using with Z3, so from the get-go I’m going to take liberties.</p>

<p>We can implement an <code>always</code> operator via a fairly simple procedure, we just roll out the execution of any formula for <code>n</code> time steps. This is the trick of bounded model checking. This rollout can be achieved by using the Z3 <code>substitute</code> function, a surprisingly useful little fellow.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful with using always. Arbitrarily nesting it’s usage may give unexpected results. Lamport makes an argument that specs very rarely do or should make sophisticated use of the temporal operators. Maybe this is good enough or maybe there is a way to patch this up.</p>

<p>Z3 does in fact return a counter model that fills the buckets up as desired.</p>

<p>TLA+ has a tendency to use functions/records which are not so obvious how to encode. There are different ways of going about this. One aspect of playing around with Z3py is that it makes extremely clear the existence of the logic language and a metalanguage. The logic is Z3 expressions, but the metalanguage is python and they are obviously very different. But there is often a choice of whether to encode things in the logic vs the metalanguage. It is usually better I think to encode as much in python as possible if you can get away with it. Z3 likes piles of simple constraints more than it likes complicated quantifiers and things.</p>

<p>For example, we can want to encode an Enum type in python or in Z3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span><span>,</span> <span>auto</span>

     <span>COMMITTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>
     <span>ABORTED</span> <span>=</span> <span>auto</span><span>()</span>

<span># z3 enum
</span><span>RMState</span> <span>=</span> <span>Datatype</span><span>(</span><span>"RMState"</span><span>)</span>
<span>RMState</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>"working"</span><span>)</span>

<p>Downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very ad hoc. The use of special autogenerated names is a great way to inadvertently smash things together</li>
  <li>TLA syntax is designed to be readable. The python adds a lot of noise</li>
  <li>TLA toolbox can format specs nicely using latex.</li>
  <li>TLA has a lot of thought gone into it. Making changes to it in an afternoon of thought is probably not to be trusted</li>
</ul>

<p>Upsides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better fits Z3, so we get good automation from the get go</li>
  <li>python is lingua franca of computing. It is comforting compared to TLA+, even if Z3py might be discomfiting.</li>
  <li>Having to download the toolbox and figure out how to use it is always going to be a slight speedbump. There is a TLA+ vscode extension now though. That might help</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python ast parsing <a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, we could probably use regular simple python syntax as a PlusCal like DSL and compile it into the above Z3-TLA+ hybrid.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if the CHOOSE operator of TLA+ will be easy to implement. It kind of seems like it requires nested solves? Can it be encoded using</p>

<p>I don’t particularly understand the TLA+ module system yet and I’m not so sure how to emulate it. Python modules might be one way, or perhaps classes.</p>

<p>Although I tried to copy exactly, perhaps one shouldn’t spec in precisely the style of standard TLA+.</p>

Have you ever left your terminal logged in, only to find when you
came back to it that a (supposed) friend had typed "<kbd>rm -rf

lines of "<em>lend me a fiver 'til Thursday, or I hit return</em>"?
Undoubtedly the person in question would not have had the nerve to
inflict such a trauma upon you, and was doing it in jest.  So you've
probably never experienced the worst of such disasters....<p>


It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday, 1st October, 15:15
BST, to be precise, when Peter, an office-mate of mine, leaned away
from his terminal and said to me, "<em>Mario, I'm having a little
trouble sending mail.</em>" Knowing that msg was capable of confusing
even the most capable of people, I sauntered over to his terminal to
see what was wrong.  A strange error message of the form (I forget
the exact details) "<kbd>cannot access /foo/bar for userid 147</kbd>"
had been issued by msg.  My first thought was "<em>Who's userid 147?;
the sender of the message, the destination, or what?</em>" So I leant
over to another terminal, already logged in, and typed</p><blockquote>        <kbd>grep 147 /etc/passwd</kbd></blockquote>

<p>only to receive the response</p><blockquote>        <kbd>/etc/passwd: No such file or directory.</kbd></blockquote>

Instantly, I guessed that something was amiss.  This was confirmed
when in response to<blockquote>        <kbd>ls /etc</kbd></blockquote>

<p>I got</p><blockquote>        <kbd>ls: not found.</kbd></blockquote>

I suggested to Peter that it would be a good idea not to try anything
for a while, and went off to find our system manager.<p>

When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten
seconds I realised what the problem was.  James, our manager, was
sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has
just come to an end.  Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was
beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal.  And at
the top of the screen I spied the following lines:</p><blockquote>
        <kbd># cd <br>
        # rm -rf *</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, shit, I thought.  That would just about explain it.</p><p>


I can't remember what happened in the succeeding minutes; my memory
is just a blur.  I do remember trying <kbd>ls</kbd> (again),
<kbd>ps</kbd>, <kbd>who</kbd> and maybe a few other commands beside,
all to no avail.  The next thing I remember was being at my terminal
again (a multi-window graphics terminal), and typing</p><blockquote>
        <kbd>cd /<br>
        echo *</kbd>
</blockquote>
<p>I owe a debt of thanks to David Korn for making <kbd>echo</kbd> a
built-in of his shell; needless to say, <kbd>/bin</kbd>, together
with <kbd>/bin/echo</kbd>, had been deleted.  What transpired in the
next few minutes was that <kbd>/dev</kbd>, <kbd>/etc</kbd> and
<kbd>/lib</kbd> had also gone in their entirety; fortunately Neil had
interrupted <kbd>rm</kbd> while it was somewhere down below
<kbd>/news</kbd>, and <kbd>/tmp</kbd>, <kbd>/usr</kbd> and
<kbd>/users</kbd> were all untouched.</p><p>


Meanwhile James had made for our tape cupboard and had retrieved what
claimed to be a dump tape of the root filesystem, taken four weeks
earlier.  The pressing question was, "<em>How do we recover the
contents of the tape?</em>".  Not only had we lost
<kbd>/etc/restore</kbd>, but all of the device entries for the tape
deck had vanished.  And where does <kbd>mknod</kbd> live?  You
guessed it, <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  How about recovery across Ethernet of
any of this from another VAX?  Well, <kbd>/bin/tar</kbd> had gone,
and thoughtfully the Berkeley people had put <kbd>rcp</kbd> in
<kbd>/bin</kbd> in the 4.3 distribution.  What's more, none of the
Ether stuff wanted to know without <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> at least.
We found a version of <kbd>cpio</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>, but
that was unlikely to do us any good without a tape deck.</p><p>


Alternatively, we could get the boot tape out and rebuild the root
filesystem, but neither James nor Neil had done that before, and we
weren't sure that the first thing to happen would be that the whole
disk would be re-formatted, losing all our user files.  (We take dumps
of the user files every Thursday; by Murphy's Law this had to happen
on a Wednesday).  Another solution might be to borrow a disk from
another VAX, boot off that, and tidy up later, but that would have
entailed calling the DEC engineer out, at the very least.  We had a
number of users in the final throes of writing up PhD theses and the
loss of a maybe a weeks' work (not to mention the machine down time)
was unthinkable.</p><p>


So, what to do?  The next idea was to write a program to make a
device descriptor for the tape deck, but we all know where
<kbd>cc</kbd>, <kbd>as</kbd> and <kbd>ld</kbd> live.  Or maybe make
skeletal entries for <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>, <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd>
and so on, so that <kbd>/usr/bin/ftp</kbd> would work.  By sheer
luck, I had a <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd> still running in one of my windows,
which we could use to create <kbd>passwd</kbd>, etc., but the first
step was to create a directory to put them in.  Of course
<kbd>/bin/mkdir</kbd> had gone, and so had <kbd>/bin/mv</kbd>, so we
couldn't rename <kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>.  However, this
looked like a reasonable line of attack.</p><p>


By now we had been joined by Alasdair, our resident UNIX guru, and as
luck would have it, someone who knows VAX assembler.  So our plan
became this: write a program in assembler which would either rename
<kbd>/tmp</kbd> to <kbd>/etc</kbd>, or make <kbd>/etc</kbd>, assemble
it on another VAX, <kbd>uuencode</kbd> it, type in the uuencoded file
using my gnu, <kbd>uudecode</kbd> it (some bright spark had thought
to put <kbd>uudecode</kbd> in <kbd>/usr/bin</kbd>), run it, and hey
presto, it would all be plain sailing from there.  By yet another
miracle of good fortune, the terminal from which the damage had been
done was still <kbd>su</kbd>'d to root (<kbd>su</kbd> is in
<kbd>/bin</kbd>, remember?), so at least we stood a chance of all
this working.</p><p>


Off we set on our merry way, and within only an hour we had managed
to concoct the dozen or so lines of assembler to create
<kbd>/etc</kbd>.  The stripped binary was only 76 bytes long, so we
converted it to hex (slightly more readable than the output of
<kbd>uuencode</kbd>), and typed it in using my editor.  If any of you
ever have the same problem, here's the hex for future reference:</p><blockquote>
   <kbd>070100002c000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br>
        0000dd8fff010000dd8f27000000fb02ef07000000fb01ef070000000000bc8f<br>
		8800040000bc012f65746300</kbd>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a handy program around (doesn't everybody?) for converting
ASCII hex to binary, and the output of <kbd>/usr/bin/sum</kbd>
tallied with our original binary.  But hang on---how do you set
execute permission without <kbd>/bin/chmod</kbd>?  A few seconds
thought (which as usual, lasted a couple of minutes) suggested that
we write the binary on top of an already existing binary, owned by
me...problem solved.

So along we trotted to the terminal with the root login, carefully
remembered to set the umask to 0 (so that I could create files in it
using my gnu), and ran the binary.  So now we had a <kbd>/etc</kbd>,
writable by all.  From there it was but a few easy steps to creating
<kbd>passwd</kbd>, <kbd>hosts</kbd>, <kbd>services</kbd>,
<kbd>protocols</kbd>, (etc), and then <kbd>ftp</kbd> was willing to
play ball.  Then we recovered the contents of <kbd>/bin</kbd> across
the ether (it's amazing how much you come to miss <kbd>ls</kbd> after
just a few, short hours), and selected files from <kbd>/etc</kbd>.
The key file was <kbd>/etc/rrestore</kbd>, with which we recovered
<kbd>/dev</kbd> from the dump tape, and the rest is history.</p><p>


Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this
story?  Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal
words, <strong>DON'T PANIC</strong>.  Our initial reaction was to
reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's
unlikely it would have come up without <kbd>/etc/init</kbd> and
<kbd>/bin/sh</kbd>.  Rational thought saved us from this one.</p><p>


The next thing to remember is that UNIX tools really can be put to
unusual purposes.  Even without my <kbd>gnuemacs</kbd>, we could have
survived by using, say, <kbd>/usr/bin/grep</kbd> as a substitute for
<kbd>/bin/cat</kbd>.</p><p>


And the final thing is, it's amazing how much of the system you can
delete without it falling apart completely.  Apart from the fact that
nobody could login (<kbd>/bin/login</kbd>?), and most of the useful
commands had gone, everything else seemed normal.  Of course, some
things can't stand life without say <kbd>/etc/termcap</kbd>, or
<kbd>/dev/kmem</kbd>, or <kbd>/etc/utmp</kbd>, but by and large it
all hangs together.</p><p>


I shall leave you with this question: if you were placed in the same
situation, and had the presence of mind that always comes with
hindsight, could you have got out of it in a simpler or easier way?

<p><em>Update:</em> See the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25491568">Hacker News thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kh6ox0/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/programming</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kh6gh2/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/ProgrammingLanguages</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/kh1p0a/cakelisp_a_programming_language_for_games/">/r/gamedev</a> posts for discussions on this article and Cakelisp.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new programming language since the end of August 2020. It is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/makuto/cakelisp/">Github</a>, and mirrored on <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/">my site</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to see a working example first, <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame.cake</a> is a simple audio looper with Ogre 3D graphics and SDL for windowing, input, and audio. This demo supports code hot-reloading and doesn't require an external build system, only Cakelisp. You can also check <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/cakelisp/src/branch/master/runtime/Macros.cake">Macros.cake</a>, which demonstrates some use-cases for compile-time code.</p>
<p>I figured showing non-trivial examples would be much more interesting. It also proves that Cakelisp is working.</p>

<p>Cakelisp is built for me first, but it should appeal to fellow programmers who know what they're doing and want to try a more powerful language.</p>
<p>Cakelisp might be for you if you want…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncompromised performance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trust in you, the programmer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code generation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the things in that list don't make sense to you, or you think you're already getting them in language <em>X</em>, then Cakelisp isn't for you, and that's okay! We have different domains and different problems, so it makes some sense to use different languages and methodologies.</p>
<p>While many languages have these features, few have the combination of all three. Lisp has extremely powerful code generation, but makes serious performance compromises. C is great for performance but can require extremely repetitive code writing to accomplish tasks a simple code generator could handle. Rust is fast (well, apart from compilation, which is very important for iterative development to be productive), but doesn't trust the programmer.</p>

<p>My goal is to "have my cake and eat it too", meaning all three of these features in one coherent package. Importantly, there isn't one dominating principle in Cakelisp (no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Big Idea</a>). I've found that the small things like removing the need for header files, no longer dealing with external build systems, or being able to run Cakelisp files like scripts, end up making a big difference when combined in one package.</p>
<p>It is useful to go over the goals in detail so you can understand my decisions.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromised-performance">Uncompromised performance</h2>
<p>This means no garbage collection, no type boxing/unboxing, etc. Fewer abstractions (besides the ones you create) between you and what the computer is actually doing. Idiomatic usage of the language should result in performance comparable with C (in most cases, it should be identical, because it's only a thin layer on C).</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-you-the-programmer">Trust in you, the programmer</h2>
<p>While languages like Rust offer benefits in terms of security and stability, they cost programmers in terms of productivity. It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it's much less valuable when safety isn't as important (e.g. in games).</p>
<p>In a perfect world all programs would be as robust as space flight software, but in reality, that level of robustness is unnecessary for most programs. It's important to realize that the safety focus is just one way of doing things, not the <em>One True Way</em> or anything.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-generation">Powerful code generation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most languages offer far too little opportunity for the programmer to automate the actual writing of code. This power also relates to trusting in the programmer, because gone wild, the code can become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The company I work for has what I consider to be a state-of-the-art code generator built for the company's use-case: multi-platform MMOs. It's used very effectively on serialization, RPC, automatic commands, monitoring, automatic documentation, and more.</p>
<p>To give more credence to the use of code generation in games, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/index.html">Unreal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiJqUWfR90I">Naughty Dog</a> also rely on code generation.</p>
<h2 id="simplify-project-setup-and-management">Simplify project setup and management</h2>
<p>I want to dramatically reduce time wasted on C++ project set-up and "code logistics". This includes setting up build systems, creating header files, adding and managing new C/C++ 3rd party libraries, and other things of that ilk.</p>
<h2 id="gain-more-power">Gain more power!</h2>
<p>Every language has limitations. The lack of straightforward, all-powerful code generation was my primary gripe with C++.</p>
<p>For example, automatically creating function and structure bindings using C++ template metaprogramming is very complex. These are two very useful tools in game development: function bindings for commands, scripting languages, and RPC; structure bindings for serialization or game monitors.</p>
<p>I also wanted features like hot-reloading (being able to load new versions of the code without restarting the program/losing runtime state). Cakelisp made it possible to implement hot-reloading entirely in "user-space", thanks to code modification.</p>
<h2 id="have-my-cake-and-eat-it-too.">"Have my cake and eat it too."</h2>
<p>By this I mean lose little-to-nothing on metrics I care about, which include build time, runtime performance, overall complexity, and various other things. I looked into several languages in my <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">LanguageTests</a> experiment and found they all had major drawbacks I couldn't accept.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-freedom">Unexpected freedom</h2>
<p>I did not realize when I started Cakelisp how freeing it felt. All of the sudden, I got to decide what made sense to <em>me</em>, not what made sense to previous language designers.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-syntax">Freedom in syntax</h3>
<p>A simple example is type declarations. In C:</p>

<p>The same variable, in Cakelisp:</p>

<p>In my opinion C type declarations are much harder to parse than my explicit type declarations. You need to work backwards from the name to properly interpret the type. The parentheses do add more typing, but they're more clear, machine-parseable, and can be read naturally (e.g. read left to right "pointer to constant character" vs. C's "constant character pointer", which seems worse in my mind).</p>
<p>My form also handles arrays as part of the type: <code>(var my-array ([] 5 int))</code> rather than <code>int myArray[5];</code>, another way it is more consistent, readable, and parsable.</p>
<p>I chose to swap the order of name and type because it places more emphasis on the name. A well-written program will convey more useful information in the name than in the type, so it makes sense to me to have it come first for the reader.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-process">Freedom in process</h3>
<p>I also found that having an executable which preprocesses my code exactly how I want it opens the door to a huge amount of awesome features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time code execution. "Macros" and "Generators" are defined in-line with the rest of your code, making them feel like a natural part of your code. Defining them in-line makes it acceptable to add one-off macros, whereas adding such a thing to an external code generator would quickly become unmaintainable</li>
<li>Build optimization. A recent idea I discovered is automatically creating precompiled headers for large batches of 3rd-party headers. This would be a complex task that would need to be integrated in whatever build system you use, whereas Cakelisp can have it built-in</li>
<li>Other data processing. Compile-time code execution means you can do things like prepare assets, download 3rd-party code, run tests, etc. without having to set up all these additional tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I was inspired by Naughty Dog's use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp">Game Oriented Assembly Lisp</a>, GOOL, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c">Racket/Scheme</a> (on their modern titles). I've also taken several ideas from Jonathan Blow's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888">talks on Jai</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer in the game industry. I've been working since July 2015 at a studio that makes cross-platform MMOs. The company has a custom engine written in C (with some C++).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/LanguageTests">experimented</a> with other languages before deciding I needed to write my own.</p>

<p>Now that my goals are clear, I will show you how I approached achieving them.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>Cakelisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>-style notation. Here is some Cakelisp code from <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/test/src/VocalGame.cake">VocalGame</a>:</p>

<p>There are a few things you can notice from reading this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types. Cakelisp is strongly- and explicitly-typed. I prefer reading code with explicit types because I can better imagine what the computer is actually doing, and what possibilities I have with each variable</li>
<li>Name-type order. I talked about this in a previous section. I wanted to emphasize the name of a variable for conveying meaning, especially when you may have many variables of the same type</li>
<li>Explicit <code>return</code>. I find I prefer code where return points are made explicit. Lisp will implicitly return the result of the last evaluation</li>
<li>Lisp-y style. The parentheses, plus keywords like <code>unless</code>, <code>defun</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>at</code>, and <code>incr</code>. I matched Lisp only when I didn't have strong opinions for a better notation. I am not trying to create something which is compatible with existing Lisps</li>
<li>C types and function calls. Cakelisp has seamless C interop, which means Cakelisp's "standard library" <em>is</em> C's standard library. No bindings had to be written to use the C types or make the function calls</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more Cakelisp code in <a href="https://macoy.me/code/macoy/gamelib/src/branch/master/src">Gamelib</a>.</p>
<p>You should think of Cakelisp more as "C in S-expressions" rather than "Lisp with C performance". If you know C, you'll have a relatively smooth transition to Cakelisp. If you only know Lisp, you're going to have a rougher time.</p>
<h3 id="why-s-expressions">Why S-expressions?</h3>
<p>When I set out to make Cakelisp, I decided on S-expressions syntax for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsability. S-expressions shift the burden of creating a syntax tree onto the programmer. This does result on more work for the human, but I value its extremely explicit nature. It also facilitates simpler tokenization, domain-specific-language implementation, and external tool support</li>
<li>Consistency. There are only four types of tokens in Cakelisp: open and close parenthesis, symbol, and string. The consistency is admittedly limiting, so things like paths (<code>myThing-&gt;member.member</code>) become much more verbose to type, unfortunately. However, this limitation keeps Cakelisp code parsable, and has an elegant feel that I appreciate</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't believe there is one notation to rule them all, especially after I've encountered the disadvantages of using S-exprs. I'm still happy with the decision though, and it does give Cakelisp a novel and distinguishing characteristic from the many …</p></article></div>

You can enter your moves with the field names (in lower case) for the "from" and
"to" positions:

: (go e2 e4)

Castling may be entered by just specifying the king's move:

: (go e1 g1)

To promote a pawn to some piece other than a queen, you can specify a class:

: (go h7 h8 +Knight)

To undo one or several moves, enter

: (go -)

and to redo them

: (go +)

To switch sides (and have the computer play against itself), call 'go' without
arguments:

: (go)

The initial board position can be restored with

: (main)

The global variable '*Depth' holds the maximal depth of the alpha-beta tree
search. It defaults to 5. You may change it to some smaller value for a faster
response, or to a larger value for a deeper search:

: (setq *Depth 7)

The same effect can be achieved by passing the desired depth as the first
argument to 'main':

: (main 7)

The second (optional) argument to 'main' is your color ('NIL' for white and 'T'
for black).

To setup some given board position, call 'main' with a list of triples, with
each describing:

   1. The field
   2. The piece's classes
   3. An optional flag to indicate that the piece did not move yet

: (main 5 NIL
   (quote
      (a2 (+White +Pawn) T)
      (b1 (+White +King))
      (d4 (+Black +King)) ) )

At any time, you can print the current board position in the above format to a
file with

: (ppos "file")

which later can be restored with

: (load "file")


   === PilBox and Web App ===

If you have the PilBox App installed on your Android device, just type "chess"
in the settings and press the "Download" button.

To start the Web application, use

   $ pil chess/main.l -chess~main -go +

Alternatively, you can start it with German localization as

   $ pil chess/main.l -'chess~main "DE" "de"' -go +

then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

In both cases you can interact with the chess board in this way:

   â€” To enter a move, drag a piece to the new field.
   â€” A click on the board does an auto-move and then switches sides.
   â€” The search depth can be changed with a drop-down menu.
   â€” The "New" button starts a new game, and the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons
     navigate in the history.
   â€” The text "White" or "Black" indicate who is to move next. It changes to
     "White ..." or "Black ..." while the computer is thinking.
   â€” After a move, the moved piece and the old and new positions are indicated
     above that text.
   â€” "Save" and "Load" allow a single (!) save/restore of a game position.

The "Setup" button switches to edit mode and allows you to change the position
manually:

   â€” A click on a piece removes it from the board.
   â€” Dragging a piece moves it to another field.
   â€” A new piece can be placed on the board by dragging it from the setup area.
   â€” The "Clear" button removes all pieces from the board.
   â€” The "New" button sets up all pieces for a new game.
   â€” The "Game" button switches back to play mode.

As in any PilBox app, you can go to the settings (wheel icon on top right) and

   â€” switch to another language in the "Language" tab or
   â€” view the App's source code by clicking on the app name "chess" in the
     "PILs" tab.

                            <p>In May 2020, Riverlane revealed that they will lead a consortium which has been <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/05/uk-companies-to-build-radically-new-operating-system-for-quantum-computers/">awarded a £7.6m grant to build a radically new operating system</a> for quantum computers. We marked a ‘hello world’ moment in September, with the first <a href="https://www.riverlane.com/news/2020/09/commercial-breakthrough-following-success-of-deltaflow-os-trials/">successful trials of Deltaflow.OS</a>, using quantum hardware belonging to leading trapped-ion company, <a href="https://www.oxionics.com/">Oxford Ionics</a>.</p>
<p>The latest milestone is the public release of the first version of Deltaflow.OS; ‘Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ’. The product has been built to enable quantum hardware companies as well as algorithm and app developers to accelerate their research by making collaboration easier and reduce down-time in labs. This version uses simulated hardware and <a href="http://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/">ARTIQ</a> as a backend. ARTIQ is a control system which is widely used in the trapped-ion community.</p>
<p>Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ consists of the Deltaflow language (Deltalanguage), and various hardware models on which the language can be run, including an emulator of the ARTIQ control system. The Deltalanguage lets users define a graph of different hardware nodes corresponding to the type of hardware elements found in labs. After defining a programme, users can test it on increasingly realistic hardware models.</p>
<p>Robert Jördens of M-Labs commented, “My hands are twitching because I really want to see and try that&nbsp;emulator and Deltaflow. There are so many valuable pieces in there.”</p>
<p>A first <a href="https://vimeo.com/480247763/d8fd4a0708">public demonstration of Deltaflow.OS</a> took place at the virtual National Quantum Technologies Showcase on 6 November 2020, where the team demonstrated how a Rabi-Oscillation would be performed.</p>
<p>The release of Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ marks a significant step towards Riverlane’s mission to build a quantum operating system that is high performance, portable across all qubit technologies and scalable to millions of qubits.</p>
