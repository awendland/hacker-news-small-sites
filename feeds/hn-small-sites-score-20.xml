There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This section is a bit unusual because not only this console has multiple screens to draw, but also a combination of traditional tile engines working …</p></div></div></div>

August 17, 2020 | https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-0.txt.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-0.txt.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    <main role="main">

        
        
<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality.

With this operation <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> we try to repopulate gorgeous villages that are being deserted, with the young population leaving and the elderly slowly fading away.</p>
<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area.

<p><span>Despite the buzz around GPT-3, it is, in and of itself, not AGI.</span> In many ways, this makes it similar to AlphaGo or Deep Blue; while approaching human ability in one domain (playing Chess/Go, or writing <em>really</em> impressively), it doesn’t really seem like it will do <span><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scary AGI Things™</a></span> any more than AlphaGo is going to be turning the Earth into paperclips anytime soon. While its writings are impressive at emulating humans, GPT-3 (or any potential future GPT-x) has no memory of past interactions, nor is it able to follow goals or maximize utility. However, language modelling has one <em>crucial</em> difference from Chess or Go or image classification. Natural language essentially encodes information about the world—the <em>entire</em> world, not just the world of the Goban, in a much more expressive way than any other modality ever could.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> By harnessing the world model embedded in the language model, it may be possible to build a proto-AGI.</p>

<p>The explicit goal of a language model is only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize likelihood</a> of the model on natural language data. In the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">autoregressive formulation</a> that GPT-3 uses, this means being able to predict the next word as well as possible. However, this objective places much more weight on large, text-scale differences like grammar and spelling than fine, subtle differences in semantic meaning and logical coherency, which reflect as very subtle shifts in distribution. Once the former are near-perfect, though, the only place left to keep improving is the latter.</p>
<p>At the extreme, any model whose loss reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a> of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/entropy_of_english_9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language</a>—the theoretical lowest loss a language model can possibly achieve, due to the inherent randomness of language—will be <em>completely indistinguishable</em> from writings by a real human in every way, and the closer we get to it, the more abstract the effect on quality of each bit of improvement in loss. Or, said differently, stringing words together using <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov chain generators</a> gets you 50% of the way there, figuring out grammar gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, staying on topic across paragraphs gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, being logically consistent gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, and so on.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">E</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>log</mi><mi mathvariant="double-struck">P</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>]</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><msub><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mi>log</mi><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p><span>Shannon Entropy: the number of bits necessary, on average to specify one piece of text.</span></p>
<p>Why? Because if you have a coherent-but-not-logically consistent model, becoming more logically consistent helps you predict language better. Having a model of human behavior helps you predict language better. Having a model of the world helps you predict language better. As the low-hanging fruits of grammar and basic logical coherence are taken, the only place left for the model to keep improving the loss is a world model. Predicting text is <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equivalent to AI</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about GPT-3 that <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">makes it so important</a> is that it provides evidence that as long as we keep increasing the model size, we can keep driving down the loss, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly right up until</a> it hits the Shannon entropy of text. No need for clever architectures or complex handcrafted heuristics. Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model.</p>
<p>But how do we use this language model if it’s buried implicitly-represented inside GPT-x, though? Well, we can literally just <em>ask</em> it, in natural language, what it thinks will happen next given a sequence of events, and its output distribution will approximate the distribution of what the average human thinks would happen next after those events. Great—we’ve got ourselves a usable world model.</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1284042570507542528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments</a> have shown that GPT-3 often fails at world modelling, and just conjecturing that adding more parameters will fix the problem is a <em>massive</em> leap!” If you’re thinking this, you’re absolutely correct. The biggest and most likely to be wrong assumption that I’m making is that larger models will develop better world models. Since as loss approaches the Shannon entropy its world modelling ability has to become about as good than the average human on the internet<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this boils down to two questions: “Will we really make models whose loss gets close enough to the Shannon entropy?” and “How close is close enough, in order to have the world modelling capabilities to make all this practical?”</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Loss keeps going down with more parameters and compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is “most likely”—that’s the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">main takeaway of GPT-3</a>. The answer to the second question is… nobody knows. Some have demonstrated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23990902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways of making GPT-3 better at world modelling</a>, but this alone is probably not sufficient. When models with 1 trillion, then 10 trillion, then 100 trillion parameters become available, we will have empirical evidence to see whether this assumption is correct. If GPT-x demonstrates uncanny ability to predict outcomes in the real world, then this just might work.</p>

<p>A world model alone does not an agent make, though.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> So what does it take to make a world model into an agent? Well, first off we need a goal, such as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“maximize number of paperclips”</a>. Then, we just ask the world model “What action can I take to maximize the number of paperclips I have?” Simple, right? Actually, not quite. The problem is that our world model probably won’t be able to consider all the possible things that could happen next well enough to make a reasonable answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mesa.png" alt="GPT-3 considers mesa-optimization. (Source: OpenAI API)"></p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, asking the world model for a list of things you could do in a given world state would probably not be outside the capabilities of a sufficiently powerful language model (think: “I am in situation <span>xyz</span>. Here is a list of things I could do:”). Similarly, asking the world model how much reward you’d get in some hypothetical world where you took a sequence of actions would probably be possible too—imagine asking something along the lines of “I go to ebay. I look up paperclips, sorted by price ascending. I spend $100 on the first item on the list. How many paperclips will I have?”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> This will let us figure out what actions the agent can take in any given step (policy function), as well as how much reward each sequence of steps will net the agent (value function).</p>
<p>So now, to estimate the state-action value of any action, we can simply do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to estimate the state-action values! Starting from a given agent state, we can roll out sequences of actions using the world model. By integrating over all rollouts, we can know how much future expected reward the agent can expect to get for each action it considers. Then, we can simply use, for example, a greedy policy with that state-action value function, to decide on actions to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mcts.png" alt="Monte Carlo Tree Search visualized (<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Phases-of-the-Monte-Carlo-tree-search-algorithm-A-search-tree-rooted-at-the-current_fig1_312172859'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Each of these actions is likely to be very high level, such as “figure out the cheapest way to buy paperclips”, but thanks to the flexibility of language we can describe very complex ideas with short sequences of tokens. To actually execute these abstract actions once the agent decides on an action, that action can be broken down using the language model into smaller sub-goals such as “figure out the cheapest paperclips on Amazon”, similar to <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a>. Possibly even just breaking actions down into a detailed list of instructions would be feasible, depending on the capabilities of the model and how abstract the actions are.</p>
<p>We can represent the agent state as natural language, too. Since the agent state is just a compressed representation of the observations, we can ask the language model to summarize the important information of any observations for its own internal world state. The language model could be used to periodically prune (i.e forget) the information inside its state, too, to make room for more observations.</p>
<p>Altogether, this gets us a system where we can pass observations from the outside world in, spend some time thinking about what to do, and output an action in natural language.</p>
<p>To handle input, you could have an input module that turns various modalities of observations into summarized text with respect to the current agent state. For instance, you could use something like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGPT</a> to input camera images or screenshots, or raw HTML from webpages that the agent requests. How exactly this is done is tangential to the point; all that matters is that somehow the inputs are all converted to text and added to the agent state. The examples I have provided are just to convince you that it’s absolutely not insurmountable.</p>
<p>Finally, to get the model to actually act in the world, you could again use the language model to translate natural language into <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Microsoft/1OyKAYWPRrWKb?t=29m19s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code that is then executed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell commands</a>, or sequences of keypresses, or any of a number of other possible ways. Like input, there are an infinitude of different ways to solve the output problem, and which one turns out to be the best is entirely irrelevant to our discussion; all that matters is that it’s possible to get various modalities in and out of the text-only agent.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/paperclipsamzn.png" alt="An example of an input module taking a screenshot input combined with the current agent state to give an observation with the information needed by the agent."></p>

<p>This is more a thought experiment than something that’s actually going to happen tomorrow; GPT-3 today just isn’t good enough at world modelling. Also, this method depends heavily on at least one major assumption—that bigger future models will have much better world modelling capabilities—and a bunch of other smaller implicit assumptions. <strong><span>However</span></strong>, this might be the closest thing we ever get to a chance to <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound the fire alarm</a> for AGI: there’s now a concrete path to proto-AGI that has a non-negligible chance of working.</p>

<!--[^toolai]: One common line of argument is that such "tool AIs" are good enough and have desirable safety properties, and therefore agentistic AI need not ever be developed. One argument against this idea is that [agent AI will inevitably be more economically valuable than tool AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI), which would encourage their development.-->

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a simple [Markov chain generator](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild) makes a *massive* difference, but the loss difference between a Markov chain generator and GPT-2 is much smaller despite GPT-2 being able to manage grammatically correct sentences nearly all of the time, and the loss difference between GPT-2 and GPT-3 is smaller still, despite massive subjective improvements in quality. 

The difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "shxixpgozcvoomz jcxfgabsdcxfrevogjsqewdnmkj" is *massive*, but the difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a model that uses words in the same [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) as regular text earns a large decrease in loss, because if you always pick common words like "the" you have a much better chance of being right than picking rare words. Another big decrease comes from considering n-gram frequencies rather than just single-word frequencies; this is the driving idea behind [Markov chain generators](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild), which generate surprisingly good text considering how just how simple they are.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-1.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-2.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-3.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-4.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 4"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-5.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 5"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-3.png" alt="C(f), step 3"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-g.png" alt="g = lambda x. lambda y. x(y)"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-1.png" alt="C(g), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-2.png" alt="C(g), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-3.png" alt="C(g), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-4.png" alt="C(g), step 4"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that applying <code>C</code> twice reverses it. That is, show that <code>C (C f)</code> returns <code>f</code>, for any <code>f</code>.
(Note that <code>C f</code> is a function which takes in two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>f y x</code>. Applying <code>C</code> only to <code>f</code> like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>There are some other systems that give visual intuition to lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>. I like the way this looks, especially how every function is enclosed by two halves of a circle which make it obvious how that function might be applied. My notation doesn’t have this feature, but requires drawing fewer enclosing boxes as a result.</p>

<p>Visual Lambda (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-lambda/">code</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/visual_lambda_bubble_notation.gif">basics</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">paper</a>) represents lambda expressions as colored bubbles, and provides an interface for manipulating them.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/">Alligator Eggs</a> is a description of a puzzle game based on lambda calculus, which also happens to provide a visual way of working with and evaluating lambda expressions.</p>

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/">https://read.macmillan.com/promo/attacksurfacepreordercampaign/</a></p>
<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Heroes Without Limits project was created by disability advocate Sara Thompson, "producing and streaming real play tabletop games with an all-disabled/chronically ill/neurodivergent cast and crew."</p>
<p>Thompson's work also includes creating homebrew RPG add-ons "roleplay and address disability" in your own games.</p>
<p>A recent addition is the Combat Wheelchair, rules for integrating wheelchair using adventurers into your Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition games:</p>

<p>The chair comes with its own attacks and added capabilities – like being able to fix a weapon in place on it and ramming/tyre striking your adversaries, or high-speed descents on sloped terrain.</p>
<p>The docs also come with a new character class, "The Paralympian."</p>

<p>Combat Wheelchairs' obvious, manifest coolness has not prevented gatekeeping yum-yukkers from raising spurious objections to them, and these are addressed in the homebrew rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But far more interesting than Combat Wheelchairs' detractors are its boosters, who have unleashed a torrent of delightful and creative new media building on Thompson's work.</p>

<p><em> <strong>Content warning:</strong> Discussion of social justice, discussion of violence, spoilers for Jacqueline Carey books.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><em> <strong>Edit 10/25:</strong> This post was inspired by a debate with a friend of a friend on Facebook who has since become somewhat famous. I’ve renamed him here to “Andrew Cord” to protect his identity.</em>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Andrew Cord <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/02/on-some-criticism-of-lesswrong/" rel="nofollow">criticizes me</a> for my bold and controversial suggestion that maybe people should try to tell slightly fewer blatant hurtful lies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just find it kind of darkly amusing and sad that the “rationalist community” loves “rationality is winning” so much as a tagline and yet are clearly not winning. And then complain about losing rather than changing their tactics to match those of people who are winning.
</p>
<p>Which is probably because if you *really* want to be the kind of person who wins you have to actually care about winning something, which means you have to have politics, which means you have to embrace “politics the mindkiller” and “politics is war and arguments are soldiers”, and Scott would clearly rather spend the rest of his life losing than do this.
</p>
<p>That post [ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/" rel="nofollow">the one debunking false rape statistics</a> ] is exactly my problem with Scott. He seems to honestly think that it’s a worthwhile use of his time, energy and mental effort to download evil people’s evil worldviews into his mind and try to analytically debate them with statistics and cost-benefit analyses.
</p>
<p>He gets *mad* at people whom he detachedly intellectually agrees with but who are willing to back up their beliefs with war and fire rather than pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense.
</p>
<p>It honestly makes me kind of sick. It is exactly the kind of thing that “social justice” activists like me *intend* to attack and “trigger” when we use “triggery” catchphrases about the mewling pusillanimity of privileged white allies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.
</p>
<p>It always makes me happy when my ideological opponents come out and say eloquently and openly what I’ve always secretly suspected them of believing.
</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to give some of the reasons why I think Andrew is wrong, starting with the history of the “noble lie” concept and moving on to some examples of why it didn’t work very well, and why it might not be expected to work so well in the future.
</p>
<p>But in a way, that would be assuming the conclusion. I wouldn’t be showing respect for Andrew’s arguments. I wouldn’t be going halfway to meet them on their own terms.
</p>
<p>The respectful way to rebut Andrew’s argument would be to spread malicious lies about Andrew to a couple of media outlets, fan the flames, and wait for them to destroy his reputation. Then if the stress ends up bursting an aneurysm in his brain, I can dance on his grave, singing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>♪ ♬ I won this debate in a very effective manner. Now you can’t argue in favor of nasty debate tactics any more ♬ ♪
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to do that, but if I <em>did</em> it’s unclear to me how Andrew could object. I mean, he thinks that sexism is detrimental to society, so spreading lies and destroying people is justified in order to stop it. I think that discourse based on mud-slinging and falsehoods is detrimental to society. Therefore…
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But really, all this talk of lying and spreading rumors about people is – what was Andrew’s terminology – “pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense”. You know who got things done? The IRA. They didn’t agree with the British occupation of Northern Ireland and they weren’t afraid to let people know in that very special way only a nail-bomb shoved through your window at night can.
</p>
<p>Why not assassinate prominent racist and sexist politicians and intellectuals? I won’t name names since that would be crossing a line, but I’m sure you can generate several of them who are sufficiently successful and charismatic that, if knocked off, there would not be an equally competent racist or sexist immediately available to replace them, and it would thus be a serious setback for the racism/sexism movement.
</p>
<p>Other people can appeal to “the social contract” or “the general civilizational rule not to use violence”, but not Andrew:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And don’t give me that nonsense about the police. I’m sure a smart person like you can think of clever exciting new ways to commit the perfect murder. Unless you do not believe there will <em>ever</em> be an opportunity to defect unpunished, you need this sort of social contract to take you at least some of the way.
</p>
<p>He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Scott calls rhetorical tactics he dislikes “bullets” and denigrates them it actually hilariously plays right into this point…to be “pro-bullet” or “anti-bullet” is ridiculous. Bullets, as you say, are neutral. I am in favor of my side using bullets as best they can to destroy the enemy’s ability to use bullets.
</p>
<p>In a war, a real war, a war for survival, you use all the weapons in your arsenal because you assume the enemy will use all the weapons in theirs. Because you understand that it IS a war.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I am tempted to say to this.
</p>
<p>Like “And that is why the United States immediately nukes every country it goes to war with.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why the Geneva Convention was so obviously impossible that no one even bothered to attend the conference”.
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/" rel="nofollow">to this very day</a>, we solve every international disagreement through total war.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why Martin Luther King was immediately reduced to a nonentity, and we remember the Weathermen as the sole people responsible for the success of the civil rights movement”
</p>
<p>But I think what I am <em>actually</em> going to say is that, for the love of God, if you like bullets so much, stop using them as a metaphor for ‘spreading false statistics’ and go buy a gun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>So let’s derive why violence is not in fact The One True Best Way To Solve All Our Problems. You can get most of this from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1619491702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1619491702&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=AYGYZKSORVSJ52VW" rel="nofollow">Hobbes</a>, but this blog post will be shorter.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am a radical Catholic who believes all Protestants deserve to die, and therefore go around killing Protestants. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there might be some radical Protestants around who believe all Catholics deserve to die. If there weren’t before, there probably are now. So they go around killing Catholics, we’re both unhappy and/or dead, our economy tanks, hundreds of innocent people end up as collateral damage, and our country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So we make an agreement: I won’t kill any more Catholics, you don’t kill any more Protestants. The specific Irish example was called the Good Friday Agreement and the general case is called “civilization”.
</p>
<p>So then I try to destroy the hated Protestants using the government. I go around trying to pass laws banning Protestant worship and preventing people from condemning Catholicism.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maybe the next government in power is a Protestant government, and they pass laws banning Catholic worship and preventing people from condemning Protestantism. No one can securely practice their own religion, no one can learn about other religions, people are constantly plotting civil war, academic freedom is severely curtailed, and once again the country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So again we make an agreement. I won’t use the apparatus of government against Protestantism, you don’t use the apparatus of government against Catholicism. The specific American example is the First Amendment and the general case is called “liberalism”, or to be dramatic about it, “civilization 2.0”.
</p>
<p>Every case in which both sides agree to lay down their weapons and be nice to each other has corresponded to spectacular gains by both sides and a new era of human flourishing.
</p>
<p>“Wait a second, no!” someone yells. “I see where you’re going with this. You’re going to say that agreeing not to spread malicious lies about each other would also be a civilized and beneficial system. Like maybe the Protestants could stop saying that the Catholics worshipped the Devil, and the Catholics could stop saying the Protestants hate the Virgin Mary, and they could both relax the whole thing about the Jews baking the blood of Christian children into their matzah.
</p>
<p>“But your two examples were about contracts written on paper and enforced by the government. So maybe a ‘no malicious lies’ amendment to the Constitution would work if it were enforceable, <em>which it isn’t</em>, but just <em>asking</em> people to stop spreading malicious lies is doomed from the start. The Jews will no doubt spread lies against <em>us</em>, so if we stop spreading lies about them, all we’re doing is abandoning an effective weapon against a religion I personally know to be heathenish! Rationalists should win, so put the blood libel on the front page of every newspaper!”
</p>
<p>Or, as Andrew puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s talk about how beneficial game-theoretic equilibria can come to exist even in the absence of centralized enforcers. I know of two main ways: reciprocal communitarianism, and divine grace.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal communitarianism is probably how altruism evolved. Some mammal started running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat" rel="nofollow">TIT-FOR-TAT</a>, the program where you cooperate with anyone whom you expect to cooperate with you. Gradually you form a successful community of cooperators. The defectors either join your community and agree to play by your rules or get outcompeted.
</p>
<p>Divine grace is more complicated. I was tempted to call it “spontaneous …</p></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Just because your state or city allows you to bring staff back to the office doesn’t mean that the facilities are ready for them to work safely. Here’s what you need to consider before employees return – assuming you can convince them to do so. Don’t count on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a now-common tale: The developers and the rest of the company staff have been working at home since March. For the most part, things have gone well enough. After <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">some initial glitches</a>, the team is productive, reasonably happy (given the additional stress), and their goals are met.</p>
<p>However, the day is coming when you no longer have to keep everyone out of the office. You can bring them back. Or can you?</p>
<h3>Decorating the petri dish</h3>
<p>Before you bring staff back to a shared space, you have to comply with a new bunch of rules about office work to meet post-covid-19 guidelines. While the specific details may differ where you are, all of the new workplace rules include social distancing requirements. Almost certainly, your pre-covid-19 workplace doesn’t allow for six feet of space between workers.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t trivial. You need <a href="https://theconversation.com/goodbye-to-the-crowded-office-how-coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-work-together-137382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical reconfiguration of work areas</a>. Desks need to be farther apart, possibly with barriers between work stations. (So much for <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/sgc-research-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-employees-feel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alleged benefits of collaboration</a> in an open office.) Because you probably don’t have space to move everyone apart, you need to decide whether you need everyone in the office at the same time – which means cultural impacts that are as important to think about as building airflow.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that you <em>do</em> want to bring people back into the corporate headquarters – or that you need to, for reasons of security. Here are the adjustments to make now, before people return to their commutes.</p>
<h3>Beyond office space</h3>
<p>According to Marina Vaamonde, CEO of real estate investment firm <a href="https://propertycashin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PropertyCashin.com</a>, companies have to arrange for more parking than they had pre-Covid. The reason, she explains, is that <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer workers are willing to share space on public transportation</a>. “People want to drive their own cars into work, so you need more parking,” she points out.</p>
<p>The office itself needs <a href="https://vicuspartners.com/articles/6-office-design-trends-post-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant redesign</a>. “You need to have airflow and outdoor space,” Vaamonde explains. “Now that all of the communal indoor spaces are closed or used for offices, people want to have an outdoor area where they can meet and breathe fresh air.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Giridhara Raam M, product evangelist at <a href="https://www.zohocorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoho Corporation</a>, protecting employees requires a complete rethinking of the office itself. “Considering most of the work spaces operate with a centralized air conditioning system, it is better to avoid it. Work spaces need to be redefined; cubicle systems and socially distanced seating spots with free air flow should be adopted at least for a year. Open offices are even more satisfying than closed spaces, due to droplets.”</p>
<p>The physical configuration of the office has to change. “Cubicles are coming to an end,” Vaamonde says, because they don’t allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>But while barriers can be built around the cubicles, Vaamonde believes they won’t be necessary. The employees won’t be there to use them.</p>
<p>Expect big central offices, such as the ones in downtown Houston where Vaamonde works, to remain mostly empty. Employers may move to smaller offices in the suburbs, she predicts. “They will be more like coworking spaces where you have spaces for a day.” The newly-envisioned office will have more open space, providing larger areas where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>All that assumes your employees are ready to come into the office, however. Don’t count on that.</p>
<h3>You might <em>want</em> employees to return to the office. Good luck with that plan</h3>
<p>Your staff has been <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-human-backup-establishing-the-teams-unlikely-successors/">working at home for nearly six months</a>. Many of those people are disinterested in coming back to an office for work. Others may feel that they only need to come into the physical plant occasionally, when they need access to services that are only available in the office, such as a specific test platform that can’t be reached via a cloud connection. And with so many cloud services nowadays, those are rare.</p>
<p>Sarah Riegelhuth, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.growmyteam.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grow My Team</a>, which specializes in hiring and engaging remote professionals, thinks that the ultimate resolution is for workforces to be mostly remote. “This allows people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/15/21258793/bay-area-exodus-silicon-valley-san-francisco-facebook-google-apple-twitter-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live where they want to be</a>,” she says. It also permits flexible schedules, and other practices that enable staff to be more productive. (One reason: less time lost in social interactions.)</p>
<h3>Still: Some jobs do require on-site participation</h3>
<p>Businesses were forced to accept telework due to the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean everyone in every company can work from home in the long term. Manufacturing jobs, field support, and many service jobs must be done where the work actually is. Employees who deal with intellectual property and personally identifiable information may need to schedule their work so they address sensitive data on their few days in the office.</p>
<p>And there are other factors. This includes choosing which job functions should return to work first.</p>
<p>“Only the data critical roles should return back to corporate premises first, due to security concerns,” says Raam. “Others can stay back and facilitate remote work.” The critical resources can work in shifts assuring there are limited people inside a defined area.</p>
<p>In many cases, the end result is likely to be a mix of in-office workers and people continuing to work from their couches.</p>
<p>Ready or not, you have to change operations to deal with employees who will work at home permanently. Your management, HR, and IT systems need to adjust to a higher percentage of full-time telecommuters, for whom working from home is a better option. It’s your job to find a way to make that work.</p>
<p>That has a significant impact on office IT systems. For example, redefined work spaces mean that workstation locations will change, which affects how office computers connect to the network even if everything is wireless.</p>
<p>Likewise, the business needs to bring communication and security requirements for remote workers up to corporate standards. This may mean providing dedicated lines for employees who don’t have home internet service. Or the company may need to pay for a level of service beyond what the employee might otherwise need. Or a better chair.</p>
<p>Once you admit that the work-at-home phase isn’t temporary, the company may need to provide computers and software if employees are currently using personal computers or laptops. One reason is physical security. When employees use their own computers for work, it’s hard to prevent them from using the same devices for everything from their family’s homework to grocery shopping. The business computer needs client security and communications security products, such as corporate-grade VPNs, firewalls, or network security equipment.</p>
<h3>Split culture</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s the question about how corporate culture affects workers when they’re at home. Office politics will change, if only because it’s hard to get people involved in back-stabbing when their backs are back at home. “The reality is that there’s still a culture,” Riegelhuth says. “In my experience, the culture evolves.”</p>
<p>In many cases, some parts of the corporate culture, notably office politics, are diminished, which helps productivity. In others, such as the informal back channels that help decision making, the impact on the culture may be problematic. But Riegelhuth notes that there are ways to keep back channels and brain storming alive.</p>
<p>“We have a vision, we have a purpose and we have our values. We have a weekly team meeting where everybody comes on to Zoom,” Riegelhuth says. “We get an hour of face time every week.”</p>
<p>“One of the advantages that we’ve seen is looking at our health and wellbeing,” Riegelhuth adds. “Taking sick days used to be frowned on. It used to be a badge of honor not to take sick days.” Now, she says, the company culture has changed to make health and wellbeing important parts of her company’s culture.</p>
<p>There’s a general agreement among both managers and experts that remote working is here to stay. While some employees will always need to be in the building, most won’t. And in many cases, the company will organize itself so that it functions solely online. Some employees need to come to the office occasionally, some on a regular basis and a few most of the time.</p>
<p>But for office workers, the daily 9 – 5 in the building is a thing of the past. It may take some organizations a while to figure that out, but home will be where the heart, and the job, is.</p>

                What's flying above us?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working to make it easy to find out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how:
            </p>

            
            <p>
                My <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1294002338215034880">Advisory Circular network of
                    twitter bots</a> post in real-time whenever they detect aircraft
                flying in circles over cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portland, Minneapolis,
                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my
                bots can answer your question—even if it's an advanced military surveillance plane:
            </p>

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            

            
            <p>
                A few years ago I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sowJrQQfgxnLCErb-CvUV8VGXdtca6SWYWWLRPZgaHI/edit?usp=sharing">discovered
                    a secret FBI aerial surveillance program</a>, involving more than 100 aircraft
                registered to front companies. I was one of the first people to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9508812">post online</a> about the program.
            </p>
            <p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150605064602/http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/">Fusion
                    Media
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                I continue to help journalists with stories related to government aerial surveillance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                I've always funded this work myself, but now I'm in the situation of having been furloughed without pay
                since April.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours in development work trying to bring the public this essential
                information for free. I'd like to continue this work, both supporting existing projects and implementing
                new ideas (I'd also like to replace my broken laptop).
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>

              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Yubikeys are great for security, but their benefits decrease somewhat when you leave them in your computer unattended.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I unfortunately have a habit of forgetting my key when I walk away from the computer. I also have login passwords that are way too long and easy to typo.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s a way to solve both of these problems: use a Yubikey to unlock your computer when you put it in and lock your computer when you remove it!</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art<a href="#prior-art" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first example I remember seeing of this concept years ago was <a href="https://www.predator-usb.com/predator/en/index.php">Predator</a>, Windows software (with a delightfully retro website) that locks your computer when you remove a special USB drive. Similar examples for Linux include <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/pamusb">pamusb</a>, which allows you to login using Linux’s PAM by inserting a specially-formatted USB stick.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays most people use Yubikeys to accomplish this, and Yubico has <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html">convenient guides</a> on how to accomplish this very task. However, I wanted to make it <em>touchless</em> – that is, I wanted to be able to plug in my Yubikey and instantly unlock my laptop, without clicking through logins or touching the Yubikey button. Upon removal, I wanted to instantly lock my computer.</p>

<p>There are some guides on how to do this online (unlock when you plug in, lock when you remove), but unfortunately most of them fall prey to the problem described in <a href="https://medium.com/@d0znpp/how-to-sacrifice-security-using-a-public-yubikey-linux-guides-c823c4c6e2">this article</a>. A lot of them use udev to detect when the Yubikey is plugged in, but they don’t actually authenticate the key beyond checking its vendor ID, model ID, and sometimes serial number, which all can <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/changing-creating-a-custom-serial-id-on-a-flash-drive-low-level-blocks.2099116/">easily be faked</a>.</p>
<p>To provide actual security, most official guides use either <code>pam_u2f</code> (which authenticates a Yubikey through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor">U2F protocol</a>) or <code>pam_yubico</code> (which uses either online validation through YubiCloud or offline validation through a challenge-response protocol). The U2F method requires a tap on the Yubikey, while the challenge-response process can be done without user interaction, so I went with the latter. I set up traditional Yubikey authentication using <a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/yubikey-login/">this great guide from System76</a>.</p>
<p>However, I still needed some way to test the challenge-response for success when I plugged in the key. Usually, <code>pam_yubico</code> is run when you login or unlock your computer (i.e. when pressing the enter key on the lockscreen). But I didn’t want <em>any</em> clicks, so I needed a way to run it without interaction.</p>
<p>Enter <code>udev</code> (again) and <code>pamtester</code>!</p>
<p>Here’s the udev rules I included:</p>
<pre><code>kevin@you:~ » cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey.rules
ACTION=="remove", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh lock"
ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh unlock"
</code></pre><p>These rules effectively call a script when inserting and removing the key, so I can trigger any action from the script. Note that the script <strong>should not immediately unlock the computer</strong>, to avoid the security issues mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To actually test the challenge-response from the Yubikey on inserting, I decided to use <a href="http://pamtester.sourceforge.net/">pamtester</a>, a simple utility that pretends to trigger a PAM authentication from the command line. Since <code>pam_yubico</code> is installed, this will naturally test the challenge-response if a Yubikey is plugged in.</p>
<p>Here’s the final script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>exec 1&gt; &gt;<span>(</span>logger -s -t <span>"</span><span>$(</span>basename <span>"</span>$0<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
echo <span>"RUN"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span>$1<span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lock"</span> <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>
        pkill -USR1 swayidle
<span>else</span>
        <span># unlock</span>
        <span>if</span> echo <span>""</span> | pamtester login kevin authenticate; <span>then</span>
                <span># PAM login successful</span>
                <span># kill locker</span>
                kill -KILL <span>$(</span>pgrep swaylock<span>)</span>
                ps aux | grep swaylock
                <span># turn on displays</span>
                SWAYSOCK<span>=</span><span>$(</span>ls /run/user/1000/sway-ipc.*.sock<span>)</span> swaymsg <span>"output * dpms on"</span>
        <span>fi</span>
<span>fi</span>
exit <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>On lock, it immediately locks my desktop (by sending a SIGUSR1 to swayidle, the program that manages locking on the Sway window manager)</li>
<li>On unlock, it first sees if it can authenticate using pamtester without interaction (when no Yubikey is inserted or if the key is invalid, pamtester asks for a password). If it can, it kills the lockscreen and turns on all displays using Sway WM protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is amazingly convenient, and has successfully made me remember to pull out my Yubikey when leaving my computer unattended more than once<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>! Mission success.</p>

<p>I’ve significantly downgraded this statement in severity after some excellent comments on Hacker News have pointed out that (1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192390">stealing a Yubikey is incredibly unlikely unless you’re a person of interest</a>; (2) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192138">even if you have the Yubikey, you still can’t directly extract e.g. a private key</a>; and (3) a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190313">Yubikey protects against SSH/GPG fraud because it can require a PIN and lock out over time</a>. Case in point, Yubikeys are good. I’d argue that it’s still not good to have your key stolen (e.g. perhaps if you’re targeted by a government/<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194081">industrial espionage</a>, or the malicious significant other attack, where they know your password and can steal your key for 2FA if unattended), but I see that it’s not as much of a risk as I originally thought. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study has found that 13% of people think of themselves as pathological liars, or say that others consider them to be pathological liars. Those 13% reported telling about 10 lies per day.</p><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#.XvDDrEQ2jzE%20">Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice</a>,&nbsp;included 623 people. The researchers recruited them in 2019 from various mental health forums, social media, and a university.</p><p>The participants spanned a range of ages, ethnicities, education levels, and income levels. The researchers asked them whether they thought of themselves as pathological liars, or if others thought of them that way. The respondents also took a lie frequency assessment and other questionnaires.</p><h2>Greater distress and impaired functioning</h2><p>The study found the pathological liars were more likely to experience distress and impaired functioning, especially in social relationships. This diminished functioning also applied to legal contexts, work, and finances. Their distress often had to do with worries about whether their lies would be be discovered.</p><p>The pathological liars in the group also reported telling lies for no specific reason, and said many of their lies grew out of an initial lie.</p><p>The majority of participants in the pathological liars group indicated that their problematic lying began during adolescence. People in this group were also more likely to say their lying was out of their control, indicating a kind of compulsiveness. Likewise, people in this group said they felt less anxious after lying.</p><h2>From <em>pseudologia phantastica</em> to pathological liars</h2><p>The phenomenon of the “pathological liar” was first recorded in 1891 by psychiatrist <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/pathologische-L%C3%BCge-psychisch-abnormen-Schwindler/dp/3226034618/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594994372&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAnton+Delbr%C3%BCck&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anton Delbr?ck</a>. He initially called it <em>pseudologia phantastica</em>, and used the term to describe people who told so many outrageous lies that their behavior could be considered pathological.</p><p>Since then, research into pathological lying has been surprisingly scant. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x">analysis</a> of prior case studies found <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pathological lying</a> equally represented among men and women, with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://psychnewsdaily.com/category/iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IQs</a> of the liars in the average to above average range.</p><h2>Formal recognition</h2><p>Pathological lying has not (yet) been classified as a diagnostic entity in either the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSM-5</a> or the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICD-10</a>, but the researchers behind the present study are hoping to change that. As they write, “we suggest that PL should be defined as a persistent, pervasive, and often compulsive pattern of excessive lying behavior that leads to clinically significant impairment of functioning in social, occupational, or other areas.”</p><p>Pathological lying also causes distress, they say, and poses a risk to the self or others; an example of this risk is if a pathological liar conceals the presence of suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Formal recognition of pathological lying as a disorder would bring many benefits, as researchers would then be better able to examine its features and causes. And effective treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly pharmaceutical drugs, could then be more thoroughly investigated.</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> P<em>athological Lying: Theoretical and Empirical Support for a Diagnostic Entity</em><br><strong>Authors: </strong><a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#">Drew A.

</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<date>Published: 2020-08-15 | Categories: <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/engineering"><span>[»]</span> Engineering</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/optics"><span>[»]</span> Optics</a></b>and<b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/programming"><span>[»]</span> Programming</a></b>.</date>
<p>4 Months and 400 hours were necessary to bring life to the Spectrum Analyzer software that I am glad to announce to you today.</p>

<p>The software, which was initially modest, has grown into a fully functional program suite that covers most of the features traditionally implemented in commercial spectroscopy software. It includes single and live acquisition of spectra, loading/saving and export to clipboard, filtering, baseline removal and an automated calibration algorithm that I specially designed for the occasion. A screenshot of the software performing a calibration is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.thepulsar.be/images/spectrum-analyzer-software-for-openraman/screenshot.png"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Spectrum Analyzer software screenshot</figcaption></figure>

<p>A <a href="http://www.open-raman.org/build/software/" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> specific page</a> was created on the companion website to host the latest version of the software for download. As the rest of the project, the software is distributed under the open-source CERN OHL-W v2 license.</p>

<p>Although the software was designed to interface to the OpenRAMAN spectrometers, it will actually work with any dispersion-based spectrometers using PointGrey camera. It may even work with different camera manufacturers or with CCD linear array as long as you provide a DLL to interface to the hardware. The source code is given with a the DLL necessary to interface to PointGrey cameras, which can be used as an example on how to implement other camera types. The program even support multiple spectrometers connected to the same computer using each a different hardware! I don’t know if that will actually be useful but I made it as flexible as possible to avoid restrictions that would later block some users.</p>

<p>The software will work with either .CSV files or with a custom file format that I implemented using an upgraded version of the technique I presented <a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/article/implementing-object-persistence-in-c--"><span>[»]</span> here</a>. One of the most challenging difficulty I had to face was to allow 32 bits version of the software to load the files saved with the 64 bits version. This seems easy at glance but the original technique I developed do not cope well with that. One advantage of the custom file format is that the files contains the data, the blank and all the program settings (filtering, calibration etc.) so that you can tweak them later.</p>

<p>As explained above, the software also features an automated calibration procedure. You simply measured the spectra of a Neon or Argon-Mercury lamp, give the number of peaks that appears on screen and click on the “calibrate!” button. The algorithm is extremely robust to missing peaks and converge to a solution within a few seconds (4 seconds on my super-old laptop). By default, the algorithm will look on a very broad range of parameters, which basically cover the whole visible region of the spectrum, but advanced user can also tune the settings when necessary.</p>

<p>The software also implements many other features like time-lapsed acquisitions to monitor reactions, automatic saving of spectra, baseline removal algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The user can also freely choose between wavelength and Raman shifts axis, save and import calibration data etc. Also, the calibration will be saved inside the camera so if you connect the spectrometer to a different computer it will remain calibrated!</p>

<p>I invite you to test the software to discover all the possibilities. You don’t have to possess a spectrometer to run the software as you can import any .CSV file where the first column represents the x-axis and the second column the y-axis.</p>

<p>During the next weeks/months, I will post detailed articles on how the major features were implemented. The first article will be about the automated calibration procedure.</p>

<p>Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so.</p>

<p>Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so.</p>

<p>The draft code will allow Australian news businesses to negotiate for fair payment for their journalists’ work that is included on Google services.</p>

<p>This will address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.</p>

<p>A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy.</p>

<p>We will continue to consult on the draft code with interested parties, including Google.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code/draft-legislation">Consultation</a> closes on 28 August 2020.</p>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>
