	<p>Apple has told Telegram to take down channels used by protestors in Belarus.</p>

<p>Apple is requesting that Telegram shut down three channels used in Belarus to expose the identities of individuals belonging to the Belarusian authoritarian regime that may be oppressing civilians. Apple’s concern is that revealing the identities of law enforcement individuals may give rise to further violence.</p>
<p>Telegram, however, would prefer to keep the channels open, but the company said that it feels it has no choice in the matter. These channels are a tool for Belarus’ citizens protesting the recently rigged presidential election, but, with a centralized entity like Apple calling the shots on its own App Store, there’s little the protesters can do about it, explains Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.</p>

<p>“I think this situation is not black and white and would rather leave the channels be, but typically Apple doesn’t offer much choice for apps like Telegram in such situations,” Durov wrote in his Telegram channel.</p>
<p>The tension between Apple and Telegram is part of the wider issue surrounding Belarus’ 2020 election, which saw incumbent Alexander Lukashenko re-elected despite claims and evidence the election was rigged. The result has seen thousands of Belarusian citizens take to the streets to protest.</p>
<p>This tension also highlights a problem with centralized app stores. “Unfortunately, I assume these channels will end up getting blocked on iOS, but remain available on other platforms,” Durov added.</p>

</small></p>

<p>For two decades now, I have been interested in sleep research due to my professional involvement in memory and learning. This e-book attempts to produce a synthesis of what is known about sleep with a view to practical applications, esp. in people who need top-quality sleep for their learning or creative achievements. Neurophysiology of sleep is an explosively growing branch of science. Many theories that are currently contested will soon be forgotten as a result of new findings. Consequently, this text is likely to grow old very quickly (compare old versions from <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">2000</a> and <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm">2012</a>). Still, some basic truths about sleep are well-established, and practical conclusions can be drawn with the benefit to human creativity and intellectual accomplishment. In this text, I provide some links to research papers and popular-scientific articles that advocate disparate and contradictory theories. Please consult other sources to be certain you do not to get a one-sided view! This text includes some indications on how to use <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a> in the treatment of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, advanced and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">delayed sleep phase syndromes</a>, and some other sleep disorders. If your own experience can contribute to the ideas presented herein, I will gladly <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">hear from you</a> (esp. in the context of learning and creativity).

<h2><span id="Dreams_of_good_sleep">Dreams of good sleep</span></h2>
<p>It is everyone's dream to wake up fresh, happy, and ready for action on a daily basis. Sadly, in the modern world, only a small minority lives that dream. Yet the dream is within reach for most healthy people given:
</p>
<ol><li> a bit of knowledge, and</li>
<li> a readiness to make some lifestyle sacrifice.</li></ol>
<p>I hope that this article compiles all the basic ingredients of knowledge that are helpful in accomplishing refreshing sleep. As for the sacrifice, it is important to begin with the understanding that one cannot eat one's cake and have it too. Healthy sleep may be incompatible with some modern habits, some cravings, or some lifestyle choices. At worst, refreshing sleep may be incompatible with one's job or even long-term goals. Due to the latter fact, this article cannot provide a solution for everyone. Moreover, having a happy and fresh mind on a daily basis is a difficult thing to accomplish even with the whole arsenal of scientific knowledge and a full focus on good sleep. However, let me state it emphatically:
</p>
<p><b>Good sleep on most nights is feasible for most people!</b></p>
<p>This article was originally written <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">a decade ago</a>. I have always been interested in memory, learning, and sleep. In addition, in my job, sleep is as important as oxygen. As we all move deeper into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy">Knowledge Economy</a>, the issues discussed herein will become more and more important for each of us. After writing the original article, I had the great pleasure of getting in touch with hundreds of people experiencing various sleep problems. I came to see first hand how knowledge of sleep helps solve their problems. I could also see how the industrialized age lays obstacles in one's quest for good sleep and high productivity. I have witnessed a true epidemic of sleep phase disorders, an explosion of interest in polyphasic sleep, and an exponential increase in interest in the matters of sleep in general. Despite my pleas, many people just cannot avoid using an alarm clock, running all-nighters before exams, waking their kids cranky for school, popping pills before sleep, leaving babies in their cots to <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#cry_it_out_method" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § cry it out method">cry it out</span></a></dfn> for sleep, etc. The picture would be pretty sad and alarming were it not for the fact that there is hope in knowledge. With a degree of determination, everyone can improve his, her, or their kids' sleep.
</p><p>This article is a compilation of the most important and the most interesting things about the biology of sleep. It is supposed to help you gain knowledge needed to achieve high quality refreshing sleep that will boost your mental powers. The article explains why sleep is vitally important for health and for the brain. It argues that sleep deserves highest respect, and that most people could get excellent sleep if they only followed the prescribed rules.
</p><p>Since writing the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">Good sleep, good learning, good life</a>, tremendous progress has been made in the science of sleep. My own work with tools such as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> has shed some interesting light on the connection between sleep and learning. As I kept addressing the progress in sleep science in minor articles and FAQs, some visitors to <a href="http://super-memory.com/">super-memory.com</a> complained that valuable nuggets of information are dispersed throughout the site instead of being organized in a more encyclopedic manner in a single article. Here then comes a comprehensive compilation, in which I would like to retain the focus on practical knowledge that is helpful in achieving good sleep. However, I would still like to smuggle in some lesser known research findings that might be inspiring for an average reader and/or a scientist working in the fields of sleep, memory, and learning. If you believe I left out anything important that others should know, please <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">let me know</a>.
</p><p>As the article grew to be insanely long, you may wish to begin with the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Summary" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Summary">summary at the bottom of the article</a>. And if even that is too long, here are the highlights:
</p>
<ul><li> respect sleep as your tool for high IQ and good learning</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a> can help you resolve many sleep problems</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_sleep" title="Biphasic sleep">biphasic sleep</a> schedule is probably the healthiest schedule for creative people</li>
<li> do not wake up kids for school; if they cannot wake up in time, let them skip a class or two, or consider <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a></li>
<li> let babies and young children sleep on demand, co-sleeping is a great idea (even if many pediatricians will tell you otherwise)</li>
<li> exercise, learning, and sleep are your best tools for brain growth!</li>
<li> avoid regulating sleep and alertness with substances, esp. sleeping pills, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Effects of alcohol on sleep">alcohol</a>, illegal drugs, nicotine, and <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#caffeine" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § caffeine">caffeine</span></a></dfn></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Understanding_sleep">Understanding sleep</span></h2>
<p>Too few people realize how important sleep is! The alarm clock is an often-used fixture in an overwhelming majority of households of the modern world. By using electric lighting, alarm clocks, sleeping pills, and shift-work, we have wreaked havoc on the process of sleep.

</div>
<p>Over the last hundred years of the twentieth century, we have intruded upon a delicate and finely regulated process that was perfected by several hundred million years of evolution. Yet only recently have we truly become aware that this intrusion may belong to the most important preventable factors that are slowing societal growth in industrial nations! In a couple of years from now, we may look at alarm clocks and "sleep regulation" in the same way that we look today at other "great" human inventions in the league of cigarettes, asbestos materials, or radioactive cosmetics.
</p><p>Check this list below and see which applies to you:
</p>
<ul><li> I often have problems with falling asleep at the right time</li>
<li> I often find it painful to get up in the morning due to sleepiness</li>
<li> I am often awfully drowsy at school or at work</li>
<li> I regularly cut my sleep by 2-3 hours as compared with what my body seems to need</li>
<li> I use the alarm clock and truly hate it</li>
<li> I drink buckets of coffee or coke</li>
<li> I often take 2-4 hour naps in the evening</li>
<li> for me, at least one of the above is a source of regular stress or reduced productivity</li></ul>
<p>I bet that chances are around 90% you could subscribe to one of the above. Perhaps this is why you are reading this article. It is also highly likely you have already learned to accept the status quo, and you do not believe you can do much about it. This article may hint at some remedies. However, the bad news is that for a real solution you will probably need to change your family life, your work, your boss, or some social rules!
</p><p><b>Sleep isn't just a form of rest!</b> Sleep plays a critical physiological function, and is indispensable for your intellectual development! Those who do not respect their sleep are not likely to live to their full mental potential!
</p><p>Modern society has developed a set of well-entrenched rules that keep sleep in utmost disregard. This has been driven to pathological levels in American society. Here are some bad rules that hurt sleep:
</p>
<ul><li> it is ok to use an alarm clock to cut sleep short</li>
<li> it is ok to work in shifts</li>
<li> it is ok to travel people around the world without much attention to the jet lag problem</li>
<li> it is ok to save time by sleeping less and working more</li>
<li> it is ok to pull kids out of bed in time for school</li>
<li> it is ok to skip nights before important exams, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Cutting down on sleep does not make people die (<a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">at least not immediately</a>). It does make them feel miserable, but the ease with which we recover by getting just one good night of sleep seems to make sleep look cheap. Even the reports from the Guinness World Record attempt at sleeplessness (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gardner_(record_holder)">Randy Gardner's</a> awakathon in 1964 lasted 11 days) trivialized the effects of sleeplessness. Many books on psychiatry and psychology still state that there aren't any significant side effects to prolonged sleeplessness! This is false! The Guinness Book of Records has since withdrawn its <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> category due to the involved health risks.
</p><p>In 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president, he proudly admitted that he went 48 hours without sleep because he really wanted to become the next president. Former Senator Bob Dole "improved" the record in 1996 presidential campaign: <i>We have been going 78 hours. We've got to go 96. We have been going around the clock for America.</i> Dole's feat was matched by Vice President Albert Gore Jr., who kept campaigning for three days before the election day of November 7, 2000. After the election, Gore still kept on his feet by going into extra hours of the concede-retract cycle of his cliffhanger contest against Governor George W. Bush of Texas. When Barack Obama was asked about his most …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Loading CSV File at the Speed Limit of the NVMe Storage]]>

<![CDATA[
Score 92 | Comments 27 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24736559">thread link</a>) | @todsacerdoti
<br/>
October 9, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/loading-csv-file-at-the-speed-limit-of-the-nvme-storage/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/loading-csv-file-at-the-speed-limit-of-the-nvme-storage/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I plan to write a series of articles to discuss some simple but not embarrassingly parallel algorithms. These will have practical usages and would most likely be on many-core CPUs or CUDA GPUs. Today’s is the first one to discuss a parallel algorithm implementation for CSV file parser.</em></p>

<p>In the old days, when our spin disk speed maxed out at 100MiB/s, we only have two choices: either we don’t care about the file loading time at all, treating it as a cost of life, or we have a file format entangled with the underlying memory representation to squeeze out the last bits of performance for data loading.</p>

<p>That world has long gone. My current workstation uses a software RAID0 (mdadm) over two 1TB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe storage for data storage. This setup usually gives me around 2GiB/s read / write speed (you can read more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3JYEIsjH8">about my workstation here</a>).</p>

<p>The CSV file format is firmly in the former category of the two. The thing that people who exchange CSV files care most, above anything else, is the interoperability. Serious people who actually care about speed and efficiency moved to other formats such as <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> or <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. But CSV files live on. It is still by far the most common format in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/datasets">Kaggle</a> contests.</p>

<p>There exist many implementations for CSV file parsers. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> would be two common implementations. That doesn’t account for standard implementations such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">the one from Python</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these implementations shy away from utilizing many-cores. It is a reasonable choice. In many likely scenarios, you would load many small-ish CSV files, and these can be done in parallel at task-level. That is an OK choice until recently, when I have to deal with some many GiBs CSV files. These files can take many seconds to load, even from tmpfs. That indicates a performance bottleneck at CPU parsing time.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to overcome the CPU parsing bottleneck is to fully utilize the 32 cores of Threadripper 3970x. This can be embarrassingly simple if we can reliably breakdown the parsing by rows. Unfortunately, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> prevents us from simply using line breaks as row delimiters. Particularly, when quoted, a cell content can contain line breaks and these will not be recognized as row delimiters.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> first implemented a two-pass approach for parallel CSV parsing. Later it is documented in <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/chunker-sigmod19.pdf">Speculative Distributed CSV Data Parsing for Big Data Analytics</a></em>. The paper discussed, besides the two-pass approach, a more sophisticated speculative approach that is suitable for the higher-latency distributed environment.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I implemented a variant of the two-pass approach that can max out the NVMe storage bandwidth. It is an interesting journey as I didn’t write any serious parser in C for a very long time.</p>

<h3 id="the-csv-file-parsing-problem">The CSV File Parsing Problem</h3>

<p>CSV file represents simple tabular data with rows and columns. Thus, to parse a CSV file, it is meant to divide a text file into cells that can be uniquely identified with row and column index.</p>

<p>In C++, this can be done in zero-copy fashion with <code>string_view</code>. In C, every string has to be null-terminated. Thus, you need to either manipulate the original buffer, or copy it over. I elected the latter.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapped-file">Memory-Mapped File</h3>

<p>To simplify the parser implementation, it is assumed we are given a block of memory that is the content of the CSV file. This can be done in C with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="openmp">OpenMP</h3>

<p>We are going to use <a href="https://openmp.llvm.org/">OpenMP</a>’s parallel for-loop to implement the core algorithm. Nowadays, Clang has pretty comprehensive support for OpenMP. But nevertheless, we will only use the very trivial part of what OpenMP provides.</p>

<h3 id="find-the-right-line-breaks">Find the Right Line Breaks</h3>

<p>To parallel parse a CSV file, we first need to break it down into chunks. We can divide the file into 1MiB sequence of bytes as our chunks. Within each chunk, we can start to find the right line breaks.</p>

<p>The double-quote in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> can quote a line break, that makes us find the right line breaks harder. But at the same time, the RFC defines the way to <em>escape</em> double-quote by using two double-quote back-to-back. With this, if we count double-quotes from the beginning of a file, we know that a line break is within a quoted cell if we encounter an odd number of double-quotes so far. If we encounter an even number of double-quotes before a line break, we know that is a beginning of a new row.</p>

<p>We can count double-quotes from the beginning of each chunk. However, because we don’t know if there are an odd or even number of double-quotes before this chunk, we cannot differentiate whether a line break is the starting point of a new row, or just within a quoted cell. What we do know, though, is that a line break after an odd number of double-quotes within a chunk is the same class of line breaks. We simply don’t know at that point which class that is. We can count these two classes separately.</p>

<p>This is our first pass.</p>

<h3 id="columns-and-rows">Columns and Rows</h3>

<p>After the first pass, we can sequentially go through each chunk’s statistics to calculate how many rows and columns in the given CSV file.</p>

<p>The line breaks in the first chunk after even number of double-quotes would be the number of rows in the first chunk. Because we know the number of double-quotes in the first chunk, we now know what class of line breaks in the second chunk are the start points of a row. The sum of these line breaks would be the number of rows.</p>

<p>For the number of columns, we can go through the first row and count the number of column delimiters outside of double-quotes.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-the-cell-strings">Wiring the Cell Strings</h3>

<p>The second pass will copy the chunks over, null-terminate each cell, escape the double-quotes if possible. We can piggyback our logic on top of the chunks allocated for the first pass. However, unlike the first pass, the parsing logic doesn’t start at the very beginning of each chunk. It starts at the first starting point of a row in that chunk and ends at the first starting point of a row in the next chunk.</p>

<p>The second pass turns out to occupy the most of our parsing time, simply because it does most of the string manipulations and copying in this pass.</p>

<h3 id="more-optimizations">More Optimizations</h3>

<p>Both the first pass and second pass unrolled into 8-byte batch parsing, rather than per-byte parsing. For the second pass, we did some bit-twiddling to quickly check whether there are delimiters, double-quotes, or line breaks that needed to be processed, or we can simply copy it over.</p>

<p>The complete implementation is available at <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/lib/nnc/ccv_cnnp_dataframe_csv.c">ccv_cnnp_dataframe_csv.c</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation was compared against <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a>.</p>

<p>The workstation uses AMD Threadripper 3970x, with 128GiB memory running at 2666MHz. It has 2 Samsung 1TB 970 EVO with mdadm-based RAID0.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a>, I compiled <code>csv2/benchmark/main.cpp</code> with:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> hasn’t been actively developed for the past 2 years. I built it after patched <code>paratext/python/paratext/core.py</code> by removing the <code>splitunc</code> method. The simple benchmark Python script look like this:</p>

<p>I choose the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/seaa0612/scaled-data">DOHUI NOH dataset</a>, which contains a 16GiB CSV file with 496,782 rows and 3213 columns.</p>

<p>First, to test the raw performance, I moved the downloaded file to <code>/tmp</code>, which is mounted as in-memory tmpfs.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Software</th>
      <th>Time</th>
    </tr>

<p>The above performance accounts for the best you can get if file IO is not a concern. With the said 970 EVO RAID0, we can run another round of benchmark against the real disk IO. Note that for this round of benchmark, we need to drop system file cache with: <code>sudo bash -c "echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"</code> before each …</p></div></div>

		<p>One fairly common complaint about postgres is that is that each connection uses
too much memory. Often made when comparing postgres' connection model to one
where each connection is assigned a dedicated thread, instead of the current
model where each connection has a dedicated process.</p>
<p>To be clear: This is a worthwhile discussion to have. And there are several
important improvements we could make to reduce memory usage.</p>
<p>That said, I think one common cause of these concerns is that the easy ways to
measure the memory usage of a postgres backend, like <code>top</code> and <code>ps</code>, are quite
misleading.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly hard to accurately measure the increase in memory usage by
an additional connection.</p>
<p>In this post I’m mostly going to talk about running Postgres on Linux, since
that is what I have the most experience with.</p>
<p>My bold claim is that, <strong>when measuring accurately</strong>, a <strong>connection only has
an overhead of less than 2MiB</strong> (see <a href="#conclusion">conclusion</a>).</p>
<h2 id="a-first-look">A first look</h2>
<p>Just using the common operating system tools make the overhead look much bigger
than it actually is. Especially when not utilizing
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS">huge_pages</a>
(not recommended), the memory usage for each process will look high.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at a freshly established connection, in a freshly started
postgres cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">andres@awork3:~$ psql
postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_backend_pid();</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_backend_pid │
├────────────────┤
│        <span>2003213</span> │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>16944</span>
</code></pre></div><p>About 16MiB.</p>
<h2 id="massive-leaks-luckily-not">Massive leaks!?! Luckily not.</h2>
<p>What’s worse, the memory usage will appear to grow over time. To show this
problem, I’ll use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html">pgprewarm</a>
extension to load all pages in a table into postgres' buffer pool:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SHOW shared_buffers ;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ shared_buffers │
├────────────────┤
│ 16GB           │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────┐
│  sum   │
├────────┤
│ <span>383341</span> │
└────────┘

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>3169144</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now postgres memory usage appears to be around 3GB. Even though the individual
connection did not actually allocate much additional memory. The added memory
usage is proportional to the amount of shared buffers touched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_relation_size(oid))) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_size_pretty │
├────────────────┤
│ <span>2995</span> MB        │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And even worse than that, if yet another connection also uses those pages, it
will also show as having a huge memory usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3244960<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
┌─────┐
│ sum │
├─────┤
│   <span>0</span> │
└─────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>3244960</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3244960</span> <span>2700372</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Of course postgres does not actually use 3+2.7 GiB of memory in this
case. Instead, what is happening is that, with <code>huge_pages=off</code> off, ps will
attribute the amount of shared memory, including the buffer pool, that a
connection has utilized for each connection. Obviously leading to vastly
over-estimating memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="huge-pages-accidentally-kind-of-save-the-day">Huge pages accidentally kind of save the day</h2>
<p>Many CPU micro-architectures normally use a page size of 4KiB, but also
optionally can use larger page sizes, most commonly 2MiB.</p>
<p>Depending on operating system, configuration, and the type of applications used
such larger pages can be utilized transparently by the operating system, or
explicitly by applications. See e.g.
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Hugepages">Debian wiki page about huge pages</a> for some
details.</p>
<p>Repeating the previous experiments with <code>huge_pages=on</code> makes them look a lot
better. First, looking at a “new connection”:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>3245907</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span>  <span>7612</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, a new connection now appears to use only about ~7MiB. This reduction in
memory usage is caused by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table">page table</a>
needing less memory, as it now only needs to contain <code>1/512</code>th of the previous
entries, due to the larger page size.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the test where a lot of the memory is accessed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3245843<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># ;SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
…
postgres<span>[</span>3245851<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
…

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q 3245907,3245974 -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span> <span>12260</span>
<span>3245974</span>  <span>8936</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In contrast to above, these connections now appear to only use 12MiB and 9MiB
respectively, where previously they used 3GiB and 2.7GiB. Quite the apparent
change ;)</p>
<p>This is due to the way the use of larger pages is implemented in Linux, not
because we used orders of magnitude less memory: huge pages used just aren’t
shown as part of the <code>RSS</code> column of ps/top.</p>
<h2 id="getting-less-unreal">Getting less unreal</h2>
<p>Since Linux 4.5 the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=rssanon"><code>/proc/$pid/status</code></a>
file shows the memory usage split into finer sub-categories:</p>
<pre><code>VmRSS		size of memory portions. It contains the three following parts (VmRSS = RssAnon + RssFile + RssShmem)
RssAnon		size of resident anonymous memory
RssFile		size of resident file mappings
RssShmem	size of resident shmem memory (includes SysV shm, mapping of tmpfs and shared anonymous mappings)
</code></pre><p>Looking at these stats with <code>huge_pages=off</code>:</p>

<p>Just adding up the memory usage of the non-shmem values still over-estimates
memory usage. There’s two main reasons:</p>
<p>First, it doesn’t actually make sense to include <code>RssFile</code> when measuring a
postgres backend’s memory usage - for postgres that overwhelmingly just are the
postgres binary and the shared libraries it uses (postgres does not <code>mmap()</code>
files). As nearly all of that is shared between all processes in the system,
it’s not a per-connection overhead.</p>
<p>Secondly, even just looking at <code>RssAnon</code> over-estimates memory usage.  The
reason for that is that ps measures the entire memory of the process, even
though the majority of a new connection’s overhead is shared between the user
connection and the supervisor process. This is because Linux does not copy all
memory when <code>fork()</code>ing a new process, instead it uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">Copy-on-write</a> to only copy pages
when modified.</p>
<p>There is no good way to accurately measure the memory usage of an individual
forked process, but since version 4.14 the Linux kernel at least provides an
approximation
(<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=493b0e9d945fa9dfe96be93ae41b4ca4b6fdb317">commit with description</a>)
in a process' <code>/proc/[pid]/smaps_rollup</code> file. <code>Pss</code> shows the “the process’
proportional share of this mapping” across all of a process' mappings (Search
linux’s documentation page for
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=smaps_rollup">smaps_rollup</a>
and
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=Pss">Pss</a>,
which unfortunately does not have direct links). For memory shared between
processes it will divide the memory usage by the number of processes using a
mapping.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Challenged to write about a single Unicode character, I chose the humble asterisk. In this post, Julia takes a back seat but it’s working hard behind the scenes. <sup id="fnref:Franklin1"><a href="#fndef:Franklin1">[1]</a></sup> The font used for the examples is JuliaMono.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The asterisk has a long history. The first appearance of this simple mark was probably on a cave wall somewhere, but we like to assign inventions to known individuals, so the inventor of the asterisk was: Aristarchus of Samothrace, in about 200 BCE.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that this wasn’t the other Aristarchus, Aristarchus of Samos, the famous mathematician with an interest in astronomy, because ἀστερίσκος means “little star”. The man from Samothrace howrver was a librarian, scholar, critic, and proofreader, who liked to make numerous marks (*) in the margin of texts and manuscripts, like notes, queries, and critical comments.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* Like this.</p>
<p>As well as writing little stars in the margin he also used other marks, such as the one we now call the reference mark (<code>\u203b</code>)*.</p>
<p>* Perhaps this was a refinement of the asterisk, or perhaps it came first. They look quite similar...</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-203b-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>This use of the asterisk and related marks has continued right up to the present day. Medieval scribes and scholars used a range of symbols to indicate their marginal annotations, and these continued as the printing revolution superseded hand-written manuscripts. Marginal notes were often replaced by footnotes, and the asterisk and dagger were the primary two symbols used for indicating these.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a_2020-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Another name for the dagger was the obelisk, hence the comic book characters Asterix and Obelix (which are probably familiar to you if you grew up in Europe).</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/asterix.jpeg" alt="asterix and obelisk"></p>
<p>If you’re writing a book, you can re-use these two indicators on every page, but if you want more than two footnotes on the same page, you have to reach into some of the less rarely seen marks, such as the double dagger (a ‘diesis’); the triple dagger; the section sign; the pilcrow; the ‘parallel to’; and the asterism.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2021_2e4b_a7_b6_2225_2042-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Medieval scribes, and readers who enjoy writing in the margins of books, can get carried away with the possibilities. The pointing hand or manicule* is also seen in the margins of manuscripts, and adds some human interest to the dullest of scriptural documents.</p>
<div><p>* also called the printers’ fist</p>
<p>☜</p></div>
<p>If you run out of symbols, you might have to start doubling up on them. A heavily-footnoted page could work through the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodestring-1602263615373276e9-tidy.svg" alt="image"></p><p>But by now you’re probably using too many footnotes on a single page. It could be time to switch to numbered footnotes, numbered from 1 to n for the whole chapter rather than starting at 1 on each page. These days, we can leave it to the software (such as \( \LaTeX \) or, for this web page, Franklin <sup id="fnref:Franklin2"><a href="#fndef:Franklin2">[2]</a></sup>) to do that for us.</p>
<h2 id="aspersion"><a href="#aspersion">Aspersion</a></h2>
<p>To this day, the word “asterisk” carries with it a few additional meanings derived from its history as a pointer to important additional content. It’s used in advertising, to indicate the presence of small print which you should probably read - but perhaps they hope you don’t. In American journalism, often dominated by sport and politics, the word “asterisk” has come to mean “no, you’d better read more about this before you decide what to think”. It was famously applied to George W Bush after his disputed “victory”* in the 2000 US presidential election, when the cartoonist Doonesbury started portraying Bush as a literal asterisk.</p>
<p>* Bush got fewer votes than Al Gore in Florida, but still won there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/doonesbury.jpeg" alt="gw bush in doonesbury"></p>
<p>In baseball, there's always talk of <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/06/27/roger-maris-and-the-myth-of-the-asterisk/">asterisks</a> set against players’ recorded achievements. According to the New York Times, the US Tennis Open this year (2020) should be called “The Asterisk Open”, because of the many players who couldn’t attend, and so the winner isn’t the best player.<sup id="fnref:tennis"><a href="#fndef:tennis">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another famous bearer of the insinuating asterisk is drug-peddler and bike-pedaller Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/nyt-lance-armstrong-asterisk.png" alt="lance armstrong"></p>
<p>So the word itself has picked up a bit of a smell.</p>
<h2 id="asterisk_assessment"><a href="#asterisk_assessment">Asterisk assessment</a></h2>
<p>So far, this is the history of the asterisk as told in books and web pages. Keith Hou­s­ton’s excellent book <em>Shady Characters</em> <sup id="fnref:shady"><a href="#fndef:shady">[4]</a></sup> covers the history of most of the punctuation marks in great detail. But his chapter on the asterisk concentrates entirely on the asterisk’s use as a footnote indicator, and ends more or less here.</p>
<p>Today we're used to seeing it used for many more things than footnotes, such as multiplication. In mathematics, various symbols have been used for multiplication, although the default operation is multiplication: for mathematicians, if you place two symbols in intimate contact, they’ll naturally multiply without needing any help from a third symbol.</p>
<p>The Julia language allows for implicit multiplication between numbers and variables:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt;

julia&gt; x = 2
2

julia&gt; 2x
4</code></pre>
<p>although Python doesn’t:</p>
<pre><code>% python
Python 3.8.1 (default, Mar  8 2020, 13:39:36)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2x
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
2x
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Most languages use <code>*</code> for multiplication. Mathematica* is more capable than most. Spaces denote multiplication, but you can also use a <code>*</code> for multiplication if you want to.</p>
<p>* probably renamed to the Wolfram Language since I last used it</p>
<p>Let's go back in time again, to see how the asterisk started this journey.</p>
<h2 id="galileo_galileo"><a href="#galileo_galileo">Galileo Galileo</a></h2>
<p>Up to the 1600s, the asterisk was used mainly for footnotes and decorative purposes in scientific books. For example, it finds its astronomical roots in the famous publication by Galileo, <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>, the Sidereal (Starry) Message, printed in 1610.</p>
<p>These asterisks show what Galileo called the Medicean Stars, which we now call the Galilean Moons, orbiting Jupiter.*</p>
<p>* It looks like the typesetter is using the same “O” to represent Jupiter here that was used on the title page for “GalileO GalileO” and “COsmO Medici”. The asterisk ‘plot markers’ do the job perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/sidereal-messenger.png" alt="Galileo sidereal message"></p>
<h2 id="symbols"><a href="#symbols">Symbols</a></h2>
<p>Science, and mathematics, the language of science, had gradually developed from medieval manuscripts written in elaborate Latin sentences to printed books embroidered with algebraic symbols. Mathematics moved away from the wordy descriptive approach to a more algebraic style.*</p>
<p>* This always wasn’t an unopposed process. It's been called “The struggle between symbolists and rhetoricians”. <sup id="fnref:Florian"><a href="#fndef:Florian">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the 1500s on, various authors enthusiastically promoted new syntax and probably hoped that their favourite symbols would take hold and become standard. No doubt the printers of mathematical books were happy to add the cost of designing, punch-cutting, and hot-lead-moulding all those extra new pieces of type to the final invoice.*</p>
<p>* Perhaps these days it’s not that much easier to add new symbols to a font.</p>
<p>In 1668, the Swiss author Johan Heinrich Rahn was the first to introduce the asterisk to indicate multiplication, in his algebraic treatise <em>Teutsche Algebra</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/rahn-multiply.png" alt="rahn"></p>
<p>That spiral character denotes ‘involution’ (an old word for exponentiation). His book also contains, on another page, the first printed use of the division symbol ÷.</p>
<p>Until recently, Rahn’s score had been: won 1, lost 1. The multiplying asterisk didn’t catch on at all at the time, although his division sign did.</p>
<h3 id="the_saltire"><a href="#the_saltire">The saltire</a></h3>
<p>Earlier, in 1631, William Oughtred<sup id="fnref:Oughtred"><a href="#fndef:Oughtred">[6]</a></sup>* had published the <em>Clavis Mathematicae, The Key to Mathematics</em>, and this famous textbook, with its profusion of new symbols, was very influential and studied by many, including the young Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>* 1574 – 1660 • He was a clergyman, mathematician, teacher, inventor - he taught Christopher Wren, among others. He invented the slide rule and introduced the abbreviations “sin” and “cos” for the sine and cosine functions.</p>
<p>Oughtred’s book popularized the saltire, a rotated plus sign, for use as the visible multiplication symbol. Here’s the first time it appeared in print:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/oughtred-clavis.png" alt="oughtred"></p>
<p>In the hands of this typesetter, it’s quite small compared with the other operators. It wouldn't easily be confused with the usually seriff-ed letter X.</p>
<p>Here's ×, the times sign (<code>\u00d7</code>), and the saltire:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-d7_2613-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* The saltire also goes by the name St Andrew’s Cross - who was crucified on a larger wooden version. In heraldry, it’s formed by ‘a bend and a bend sinister’.</p>
<p>Sadly, × doesn’t work as a multiplication sign in Julia, although it’s easy enough to make it work:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; const × = *
* (generic function with 385 methods)

julia&gt; x = 3 × 4
12

julia&gt; a = "hello" × "world" # ⁉
"helloworld"</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if there are any unexpected side effects when doing this.</p>
<h2 id="leibniz"><a href="#leibniz">Leibniz</a></h2>
<p>The influential mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz didn’t like Oughtred’s saltire symbol, and wrote to Bernoulli in 1698:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not like the <code>×</code> symbol as a symbol for multiplication, since it is easily confounded with <code>x</code>;&nbsp;… often I simply&nbsp;relate two quantities by an interposed dot and indicate multiplication with <code>ZC ⋅ LM</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The saltire probably found more favour in England than Germany. Newton adopted it, doubtless after seeing a need for it. Here’s the first edition of his Principia Mathematica<sup id="fnref:principia"><a href="#fndef:principia">[7]</a></sup>, published in 1687.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-first.png" alt="newton principia first edition"></p>
<p>I’d say Leibniz definitely has a ‘point’ here, because Newton's used a lowercase <code>x</code> as a surrogate saltire, although to be fair he doesn't often use <code>x</code> as a variable. But in the revised 1723 edition, Newton improves most of his font choices*:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-third.png" alt="newton principia third edition"></p>
<p>* That letter Q is eye-catching.</p>
<p>Now the saltire is much larger and, without the serifs used for most mathematical printing at the time, is less likely to be confused with an X of any size.</p>
<p>More so than Oughtred and Rahn, Leibniz was very influential: he popularized the dx/dy notation, the integration symbol, the multiplication dot, signs for congruence and similarity, and many more, and even used an asterisk for the occasional multiplication.</p>
<h3 id="too_useful"><a href="#too_useful">Too useful</a></h3>
<p>In general, though, the multiplying asterisk wasn’t often used in most mathematics (as opposed to arithmetical) texts, and was more likely to be used to indicate footnotes or for other more specialized uses. If multiplication was required, Leibniz’ dot was considered …</p></div></div>

          <h2>Status</h2>
          <p>The site is still under development. We believe we have most of the games written for the BBC Micro apart from a few very obscure ones which we are still trying to track down. If you know of a game we have missed, or even better if you own one, contact us in the forums and we will get it added to the database. We maintain a list of titles which we believe to be <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=14458">missing from the archive</a> in the forums. </p>
	  
          <h2>Ideology</h2>
          <p>We strive for ease of use rather than exact preservation of the original. Software has been transferred from tape to disc image, to speed loading. Changes have been made to enhance usability - see the <i>Who we are</i> section for more detail. Any major changes are noted on the game's page. </p>
	  
          <h2>Thanks</h2>
          <p>In addition to the people who worked on the archive and the website, we would like to give a big <strong>thank you</strong> to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattGodbolt">Matt Godbolt</a> for developing <a href="http://bbc.godbolt.org/">jsbeeb</a>, and sharing it with the world on <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb">github</a>. It makes the website come alive - anyone can play the BBC Micro games right in the browser!</p>
	  
          <h2>Source</h2>
          <p>This web site is open source. and the <a href="https://github.com/pau1ie/bbcmicro.co.uk">source is on github</a>. Please feel free to take it and use it for your own website. We would be interested to hear what you have done with it in the forums. </p>
       </div><div>
           <h2>Who we are</h2><p>
The games on this website, almost without exception, were originally curated by Mick Brown, who announced the "30th Anniversary BBC &amp; Electron Collection" in 2014 and started <a href="http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=8270">releasing disc images on the Stardot forum</a> in May of that year. 
</p><p>
The collection is made up of games that Mick had first copied to his own "unofficial" compilation discs thirty years before. 
</p><p>
Mick has enhanced the games by adding user-friendly instructions (taken from cassette inlays or other authentic sources) and ensuring that the games are compatible with a range of emulators as well as real Acorn hardware.
</p><p>
Our thanks go to Mick for the countless hours of work he has put into compiling, enhancing, testing, and re-testing the games in this collection.
</p><p>
Thanks also to Paul Houghton for developing the <a href="http://bbcmicro.co.uk//bbcmicro.co.uk">bbcmicro.co.uk</a> website, and to Gary for hosting it.
</p><p>
Lee "Eagle Eyes" Newsome proofread the game instructions, tested every game several times, and coordinated the work on the website project.
Huge thanks to Dave Moore (user Arcadian on Stardot) for his enduring commitment to preserving and promoting all things Acorn, online and off, including the creation of the invaluable <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/">Stairway To Hell</a> archive. 
</p><p>
We're grateful to the incredibly knowledgeable members of the Stardot forum for their generous help and support.

        <p>After having just dropped out of university, at 19-years-old; I received a line of advice that <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/books">changed my life</a>.</p>
<div><p>On one unforgettable evening, I got to attend a meal that sat some of the world’s leading experts on food health and safety. Each of them had flown in from different parts of the world, as they gathered for a board meeting for the scientific journal my father founded. During the dinner, one member of the board, <em>Dr. Joseph Jen</em> (who oversaw four agencies of the <em>U.S. Department of Agriculture</em> during the Bush administration) turned to me and asked what I was up to. Despite his self-assured nature and intimidating presence,  I took the opportunity to honestly inform him that I had just left university upon feeling unchallenged and that I was looking to satisfy my ambitions somehow. I then asked him for his advice as to what to do about the matter.</p><p>
&nbsp;
This is when he uttered the line. The line that would stick with me for years to come. The line that would help focus my efforts as I revisited it time and time again before contemplating a career shift or life decision.&nbsp;</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Think of your career as a toolbox: your job is to fill it with as many tools as possible.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years have gone by and <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/now">you can now find me</a> overseeing the product development, user experience design, and culture for an app company as their VP of Product. How did I end up here? Besides the usual variables outside of my control, like luck; it was in fact my adoption of the Toolbox Strategy that Dr. Jen gave me that one evening in 2016, that uniquely positioned me as a tremendously valuable asset for the job marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, I had worked from the preconceived notion that in order to be any good at something, and thus valuable to the job market, you would need to be a <strong>specialist</strong> at that very thing. This was a great cause of anxiety for me during my first few days at university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course I was about to begin studying was <em>Information and Interface Design (BA)</em>. What I had discovered early on, was that all of my coursemates had some classical, academic training in either graphic design or art. Some students had even completed an art foundation year beforehand on the recommendation of the course leader. Meanwhile, there I was, fresh out of school, with no relevant qualifications to hand, having previously studied philosophy, ethics, and English. And in my mind, my lack of a pertinent academic background marked me as <em>doomed</em>. From the very first moment, I felt completely behind. I feared that I would never become a great designer.</p>
<p>But by comparing myself with my coursemates with <em>specialism</em> in mind, I was starting on the wrong foot. I could only see the value that an individual brought to the table through a narrow lens. Over time, however, I began to look at my value in a different manner. With each project, there was a presentation. And with each presentation, I started to see that my mismatch of previous academic experience was giving me a slight edge: for all the research work I did to study different cultures and backgrounds in my ethics class, allowed me to better understand the needs of people I was designing for. All the deep thinking that I did in philosophy made me consider more options as I chose which creative solution I would design. And all the extensive writing I did in English essays, gave me the tools to tell more engaging stories and better explain my process for how I came to my design solutions. These skills didn’t make me a better designer, but the combination of such skills served me in a way that put me paces ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, by the end of the year, I was beginning to grasp the underpinnings of the very strategy that Dr Jen would later give me the words for. I was widening my lens. Readjusting my focus. Discovering how the combination of unrelated past experiences was actually serving me this entire time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was adopting the <strong>Toolbox Strategy</strong>. Where your career is a toolbox; and your life is a constant pursuit of various skills and areas of knowledge to fill it with. Then, in order to equip yourself with rare insights, you simply cross-reference your learnings from the pursuit of each tool. Thus making you: uniquely valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor of Brand Strategy at NYU, <a href="https://amzn.to/2S1cV6d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott Galloway</a>, advises that in order to be remarkable, you must <em>“develop not just one area of expertise, but two skills that don’t naturally go together.”</em> Galloway compares young careerists to Lindt Chocolate and their ability to bring dark chocolate and chilli peppers together to create something uniquely valuable, as he asks: “what two attributes are you going to bring together that differentiates you?</p>

<p>Likewise, after consulting with <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/thankful-list">a great mentor of mine</a> on a long afternoon walk; he advised me that if I were to be ambitious about anything in my career, it should be to develop what he called: <em>“4 pillars of understanding”</em>. That I should master the practices of four seemingly separate fields to build an amalgamation of ideas that no one else could possess. My mentor of course walked-the-walk before giving such advice as he built a successful business on the back of his specific knowledge in Maths, Computer Science, Economics, and Psychology.</p>
<p>For years, I believed being valuable required creating the largest possible <em>circle of competence</em>. But what I have realised, is that by adopting the Toolbox Strategy, each skill and area of knowledge that you acquire gives you another circle. The unique value that you can then offer the marketplace is clear. It is, in fact, derived not from the circles themselves, but rather from the Venn diagrams you create as the perimeters of your circles’ overlap.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So how do I best acquire my&nbsp;tools?</h2>
<p><strong>Work in a startup.</strong> This is as prescriptive as my advice can get. And whilst I’m sure there are other ways in which you can develop more than one skill at a time - there is simply no better place in the working world for someone who wants to acquire an abundance of tools for their toolbox. Join one early enough and wearing multiple hats will be the very nature of your job. One day you’ll be designing user flows, another day you’ll be managing product development, and in another, you’ll be figuring out how to better market your product. At a startup, not only will your range of skills acquired be large, but your rate of learning each skill will be rapid. You will learn things by the end of the week that you will wish you had known at the beginning of it.</p>
<p><strong>Seek out uncomfortable jobs.</strong> As a designer, it can be tempting to join a company that already has design rooted in their culture. Being the, even the eighth, junior experience designer at Airbnb does seem tremendously exciting and sexy. Thinking about having so many of your colleagues validating your seat at the table is delightful for any creative. In contrast, the thought of joining a company that has never recognised the ROI of design or simply considers it to be a process to make things ‘look nice’ may be completely uninspiring. Thinking about how much you’re going to have to fight for your existence can seem exhausting for prospective creatives.</p>
<p>But be warned. If you take the former job, whilst you’ll leave with an impressive company to flaunt on your CV, you will lack the skills to match the expectation that future employers will have of you. Since you didn’t do the work that made Airbnb known for design in the first place, you will struggle to create any of the impact required from you in the role to justify the pay or title.</p>
<p>For designers, the companies that seem least interested or knowledgable in your field are usually the very best to work for. <em>High risk, high reward.</em> And for anyone else, become the marketer that takes a company from zero-to-one, rather than the tenth marketer who optimises funnels for an already well-known brand and your job will grant you tremendous insight into the very skills that actually help build products, strategies, and companies.</p>
<p><strong>Be okay with not having a linear career.</strong> Your goal is to align yourself with learning a range of skills, not with having a slowly progressing series of job titles. As you acquire your range of skills you will find yourself doing different things for very different people. You will be an <em>Associate Customer Success Manager</em> in one company, <em>Junior Marketer</em> in the next, only to find yourself as <em>Head of Product</em> in following. Rather than seeking validation in climbing some invisible ladder that ultimately leads to the same work just with more responsibility and stress, find comfort in the fact that your odd-looking LinkedIn profile is an indicator that you’re likely developing an incredible range of skills.</p>
<p>The same goes for your salary too. To truly develop skills from multiple disciplines, you will be required to walk in and out of companies playing in different markets. Each company will, therefore, look at your CV with differing opinions of your value. This means that if your salary at each position you take in your early career were to be charted on a graph, your line should look less like the sensible, Apple stock price - and more like the volatile, Bitcoin price.</p>

<p>Even now, in my role as VP of Product, I’m very much still in pursuit of tools for my toolbox. I’m constantly studying different fields: including economics, psychology, and brand strategy.

<p><em>tldr: work has started to make <a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> work as a backend in curl for HTTP.</em></p>



<p>curl and its data transfer core, libcurl, is all written in C. The language C is known and infamous for not being memory safe and for being easy to mess up and as a result accidentally cause security problems.</p>



<p>At the same time, C compilers are very widely used and available and you can compile C programs for virtually every operating system and CPU out there. A C program can be made far more portable than code written in just about any other programming language.</p>



<p>curl is a piece of “insecure” C code installed in some ten billion installations world-wide. I’m saying insecure within quotes because I don’t think curl is insecure. We have our share of security vulnerabilities of course, even if I think the rate of them getting found has been drastically reduced over the last few years, but we have never had a critical one and with the help of busloads of tools and humans we find and fix most issues in the code before they ever land in the hands of users. (And “memory safety” is not the single explanation for getting security issues.)</p>



<p>I believe that curl and libcurl will remain in wide use for a long time ahead: curl is an established component and companion in scripts and setups everywhere. libcurl is almost a de facto standard in places for doing internet transfers.</p>



<p>A rewrite of curl to another language is not considered. Porting an old, established and well-used code base such as libcurl, which to a far degree has gained its popularity and spread due to a stable API, not breaking the ABI and not changing behavior of existing functionality, is a massive and daunting task. To the degree that so far it hasn’t been attempted seriously and even giant corporations who have considered it, have <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/" data-type="post" data-id="12576">backpedaled such ideas</a>.</p>



<h2>Change, but not change</h2>



<p>This preface above might make it seem like we’re stuck with exactly what we have for as long as curl and libcurl are used. But fear not: things are more complicated, or perhaps brighter, than it first seems.</p>



<p>What’s important to users of libcurl needs to be kept intact. We keep the API, the ABI, the behavior and all the documented options and features remain. We also need to continuously add stuff and keep up with the world going forward.</p>



<p>But we can change the internals! <em>Refactor</em> as the kids say.</p>



<h2>Backends, backends, backends</h2>



<p>Already today, you can build libcurl to use different “backends” for TLS, SSH, name resolving, LDAP, IDN, GSSAPI and HTTP/3.</p>



<p>A “backend” in this context is a piece of code in curl that lets you use a particular solution, often involving a specific third party library, for a certain libcurl functionality. Using this setup you can, for example, opt to build libcurl with one or more out of <em>thirteen</em> different TLS libraries. You simply pick the one(s) you prefer when you build it. The libcurl API remains the same to users, it’s just that some features and functionality might differ a bit. The number of TLS backends is of course also fluid over time as we add support for more libraries in the future, or even drop support for old ones as they fade away.</p>



<p>When building curl, you can right now make it use up to <strong>33</strong> different third party libraries for different functions. Many of them of course mutually exclusive, so no single build can use all 33.</p>



<p>Said differently: you can improve your curl and libcurl binaries without changing any code, by simply rebuilding it to use another backend combination.</p>

No Hyper in this map yet…</figcaption></figure>



<h2>libcurl as a glorified switch</h2>



<p>With an extensive set of backends that use third party libraries, the job of libcurl to a large extent becomes to act as a switch between the provided stable external API and the particular third party library that does the heavy lifting.</p>



<p><strong>API &lt;=&gt; glue code in C &lt;=&gt; backend library</strong></p>



<p>libcurl as the rock, with a door and the entry rules written in stone. The backends can come and go, change and improve, but the applications outside the entrance won’t notice that. They get a stable API and ABI that they know and trust.</p>



<h2>Safe backends</h2>



<p>This setup provides a foundation and infrastructure to offer backends written in other languages as part of the package. As long as those libraries have APIs that are accessible to libcurl, libraries used by the backends can be written in any language – but since we’re talking about memory safety in this blog post the most obvious choices would probably be one of the modern and safe languages. For example <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png" alt="" width="204" height="204" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png 500w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"></a></figure></div>



<p>With a backend library written in Rust , libcurl would lean on such a component to do low level protocol work and presumably, by doing this it increases the chances of the implementations to be safe and secure.</p>



<p>Two of the already supported third party libraries in the world map image above are written in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">quiche</a> and <a href="https://mesalink.io/">Mesalink</a>.</p>



<h2>Hyper as a backend for HTTP</h2>



<p><a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> is a HTTP library written in Rust. It is meant to be fast, accurate and safe, and it supports both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png 640w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></figure></div>



<p>As another step into this world of an ever-growing number of backends to libcurl, work has begun to make sure curl (<em>optionally</em>) can get built to use Hyper.</p>



<p>This work is gracefully funded by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">ISRG</a>, perhaps mostly known as the organization behind <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. Thanks!</p>



<h2>Many challenges remain</h2>



<p>I want to emphasize that this is early days. We know what we want to do, we know basically how to do it but from there to actually getting it done and providing it in source code to the world is <em>a little bit of work</em> that hasn’t been done. I’m set out to do it.</p>



<p>Hyper didn’t have a C API, they’re <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2278">working on making one</a> so that C based applications such as curl can actually use it. I do my best at providing feedback from my point of view, but as I’m not really into Rust much I can’t assist much with the implementation parts there.</p>



<p>Once there’s an early/alpha version of the API to try out, I will first make sure curl can get built to use Hyper, and then start poking on the code to start using it.</p>



<p>In that work I expect me to have to go back to the API with questions, feedback and perhaps documentation suggestions. I also anticipate challenges in switching libcurl internals to using this. Mostly small ones, but possibly also larger ones.</p>



<p>I have created a git branch and make my work on this public and accessible early on to let everyone who wants to, to keep up with the development. A first milestone will be the ability to run a single curl test case (any test case) successfully – unmodified. The branch is here: <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper">https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper</a> – beware that it will be rebased frequently.</p>



<p>There’s no deadline for this project and I don’t yet have any guesses as when there will be anything to test.</p>



<h2>Rust itself is not there yet</h2>



<p>This project is truly ground work for future developers to build upon as some of the issues dealt with in here should benefit others as well down the road. For example it immediately became obvious that Rust in general encourages to <em>abort</em> on out-of-memory issues, while this is a big <em>nono</em> when the code is used in a system library (such as curl).</p>



<p>I’m a bit vague on the details here because it’s not my expertise, but Rust itself <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2265#issuecomment-696915382">can’t even properly clean up its memory</a> and just returns error when it hits such a condition. Clearly something to fix before a libcurl with hyper could claim identical behavior and never to leak memory.</p>



<h2>By default?</h2>



<p>Will Hyper be used by default in a future curl build near you?</p>



<p>We’re going to work on the project to make that future <em>a possibility</em> with the mindset that it could benefit users.</p>



<p><strong>If</strong> it truly happens involve many different factors (for example maturity, feature set, memory footprint, performance, portability and on-disk footprint…) and in particular it will depend a lot on the people that build and ship the curl packages you use – which isn’t the curl project itself as we only ship source code. I’m thinking of Linux and operating system distributions etc.</p>



<p><strong>When </strong>it might happen we can’t tell yet as we’re still much too early in this process.</p>



<h2>Still a lot of C</h2>



<p>This is not converting curl to Rust.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t be fooled into believing that we are getting rid of C in curl by taking this step.</strong> With the introduction of a Hyper powered backend, we will certainly reduce the share of C code that is executed in a typical HTTP transfer by a measurable amount (for those builds), but curl is much more than that.</p>



<p>It’s not even a given that the Hyper backend will “win” the competition for users against the C implementation on the platforms you care about. The future is not set.</p>



<h2>More backends in safe languages?</h2>



<p>Sure, why not? There are efforts to provide more backends written in Rust. Gradually, we might move into a future where less and less of the final curl and libcurl executable code was compiled from C.</p>



<p>How and if that will happen will of course depend on a lot of factors – in particular funding of the necessary work.</p>



<p>Can we drive the development in this direction even further? I think it is much too early to speculate on that. Let’s first see how these first few episodes into the coming decades turn out.</p>

<h5>2018-02-15 - By Robert Elder</h5>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to discuss the works of computer programmer Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Specifically, his work related to the C/C++ programming languages will be emphasized. &nbsp;I became motivated to do this short write-up when I realized that a lot of his work on C/C++ programming was done in the 1990-1996 era, just after digital communication formats became popular, but just before 'blog' type documentation format became popular. &nbsp;As a result, a number of references to his works are becoming dead links, or are simply lacking any context somewhere in a decaying ftp site that nobody knows about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is unlikely to be interesting to anyone with a casual interest in C programming, but it is instead intended for individuals looking to develop an extremely intimate understanding of the C/C++ programming languages and their histories. &nbsp;My interest in reviewing Roskind's work has been to look for compiler test cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I'll discuss a bit about the man himself:  &nbsp;As far as I can tell in my Googling, and assuming that I haven't confused multiple people with the same name, he was an independent consultant around 1990[1], was a co-founder of Infoseek Corporation[2][3] in 1994, joined Netscape in 1995[2], appeared in the popular documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m52s">Project Code Rush</a> around 1998, joined Google in 2008 and designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> in 2012. &nbsp;He has a number of other technical accomplishments that I haven't listed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of contributions to C programming, here are a couple files from around 1990 that are particularly worth mentioning:</p>

<p><code><pre>c++grammar1.1.tar.Z
c++grammar2.0.tar.Z
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you're reading this in the future and various links to these files may no longer be working, below are various hashes of these files. &nbsp;If you are lucky, searching for them might hopefully lead you to a mirror somewhere (at the moment they don't). &nbsp;I also checked for different sources of these files, and although I can find lots of references, I could only find a single mirror where I could download them:</p>

<p><code><pre>md5     5c5e10f21f7f77dba73f2fff792eb5d4  c++grammar1.1.tar.Z

</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after checking the license of these files, I think it should be fine to mirror them myself too:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar1.1.tar.Z">c++grammar1.1.tar.Z</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar2.0.tar.Z">c++grammar2.0.tar.Z</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The c++grammar1.1.tar.Z document appears to simply be an earlier version of the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version. &nbsp;Inside the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version, you will find the following files (according to freegrm5.txt):</p>

<ul>
<li>FREEGRM5.TXT - This introductory file</li>
<li>GRAMMAR5.TXT - Parsing ambiguities in C++, and in my grammar</li>
<li>CPP5.Y - My YACC compatible C++ grammar</li>

<li>AUTODOC5.TXT - Documentationfor my machine generated analysis</li>
<li>Y.OUTPUT - Machine generated analysis of the C++ grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'my' as used in the above list should be interpreted to refer to Jim Roskind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might question what the purpose is of digging up ancient grammars for YACC now that gcc and clang have moved on from this paradigm, but for me this information is still useful. &nbsp;The detailed analysis provided by Roskind is a good source for developing compiler test cases and learning how the language evolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there were a few discussions made on comp.compilers in the early 90s by Roskind that, at first glance, might seem like any other un-noteworthy piece of commentary in technical discussion forum, but they are in fact widely cited because they are the only time anyone has ever discussed the issue. &nbsp;One that I found very useful was <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/l/c/roskind.html">Jim Roskind on C ambiguity</a>. &nbsp;The post was useful because of several very special corner cases involving typedefs that it illustrates. &nbsp;In case that link goes dead, here is another reference to the general email thread on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.compilers/gqeQy3mXqnA">Google Groups comp.compilers</a>. &nbsp;And to back up my claim about citations, that post by Roskind is cited in <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01633123/document">"A Simple, Possibly Correct LR Parser for C11", Jacques-Henri Jourdan, FranÃ§ois Pottier</a>, among a number of other places.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you end up browsing the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">The Lexer Hack</a>, you might notice that the first reference in the article is a source of Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Unfortunately, as of today, the reference is a dead link! &nbsp;But if you pay attention, you'll note that the link references a file called 'grammar5.txt' with a date of 1991-07-11, and this is exactly the date inside the 'grammar5.txt' that you can find in the tar file mentioned above!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure, but I believe the actual use of the term 'lexer hack' might actually be a reference specifically to <em>Jim Roskind's</em> lexer hack. &nbsp;Inside of grammar5.txt, there is a note: &nbsp;"I will refer to this feedback loop (from the parser that stores information in  a  symbol  table,  wherein  the lexer extracts the information) as the "lex hack"." &nbsp;That sounds to me like he came up with the term first!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've read up until this point, you should be sold on the value of this information, either for historical purposes, or for the investigation into grammar ambiguities into the C or C++ languages. &nbsp;There are a number of other useful posts made by Jim Roskind on the comp.compilers newsgroup back in the 90s, but I won't go to the effort of listing them here. &nbsp;You'll just have to hope that those pages don't go dead before you try to search for the content on them.</p>

<p>This week, we continue our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, IVa, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week, we looked at how a blacksmith reshapes our iron from a spongy mass called a bloom first into a more workable shape and then finally into some final useful object like a tool.  But as we noted last week, the blacksmith doesn’t just need to manage the shape of the iron, but also its hardness and ductility.</p>



<p>As we’ll see this week, those factors – hardness and ductility (and a bunch of other more complex characteristics of metals which we’re going to leave out for simplicity’s sake) – can be manipulated by changing the chemical composition of the metal itself by <em>alloying</em> the iron with another element, carbon.  And because writing this post has run long and time has run short, <em>next</em> week, we’ll finish up by looking at how those same factors also respond to mechanical effects (work hardening) and heat treatment.</p>

<h2>What Is Steel?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the absolute basics: <em>what is steel</em>?  Fundamentally, <strong>steel is an alloy of iron and carbon</strong>.  We can, for the most part, dispense with many modern varieties of steel that involve more complex alloys; things like stainless steel (which add chromium to the mix) were unknown to pre-modern smiths and produced only by accident.  Natural alloys of this sort (particularly with manganese) might have been produced by accident where local ores had trace amounts of other metals.  This may have led to the common belief among ancient and medieval writers that iron from certain areas was superior to others (steel from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum">Noricum </a>in the Roman period, for instance, had this reputation, note Buchwald, <em>op. cit.</em> for the evidence of this), though I have not seen this proved with chemical studies.</p>



<p>So we are going to limit ourselves here to just carbon and iron.  Now in video-game logic, that means you take one ‘unit’ of carbon and one ‘unit’ of iron and bash them together in a fire to make steel.  As we’ll see, the process is at least moderately more complicated than that.  But more to the point: <strong>those proportions are totally wrong</strong>.  Steel is a combination of iron and carbon, <em>but not equal parts or anything close to it</em>.  Instead, the general division goes this way (there are several classification systems but they all have the same general grades):</p>



<p>Below 0.05% carbon or so, we just refer to that as iron.  There is going to be some small amount of carbon in most iron objects, picked up in the smelting or forging process.<br>From 0.05% carbon to 0.25% carbon is mild or low carbon steel.<br>From about 0.3% to about 0.6%, we might call medium carbon steel, although I see this classification only infrequently.<br>From <strong>0.6% to around 1.25%</strong> carbon is <em>high-carbon steel</em>, also known as <strong>spring steel</strong>.  For most armor, weapons and tools, this is the ‘good stuff’ (but see below on pattern welding).<br>From <strong>1.25% to 2%</strong> are ‘ultra-high-carbon steels’ which, as far as I can tell didn’t see much use in the ancient or medieval world.<br><strong>Above 2%</strong>, you have <strong>cast iron</strong> or <strong>pig iron</strong>; excessive carbon makes the steel much too hard and brittle, making it unsuitable for most purposes.</p>

Cast iron production was discovered much earlier in China than in most of the rest of the world, but cast iron products were brittle and not generally suitable for demanding use.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don’t want to get too bogged down in the exact chemistry of how the introduction of carbon changes the metallic matrix of the iron; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Properties">you are welcome to read about it</a>.  <strong>As the carbon content of the iron increases, the iron’s basic characteristics – it’s ductility and hardness (among others) – changes</strong>.  Pure iron, when it takes a heavy impact, tends to deform (bend) to absorb that impact (it is ductile and soft).  Increasing the carbon-content makes the iron harder, causing it to both resist bending more and also to hold an edge better (hardness is the key characteristic for holding an edge through use).  In the right amount, the steel is springy, bending to absorb impacts but rapidly returning to its original shape.  But <em>too much</em> carbon and the steel becomes <em>too</em> hard and not ductile enough, causing it to become brittle.</p>



<p>Compared to the other materials available for tools and weapons, high carbon ‘spring steel’ was essentially the super-material of the pre-modern world.  High carbon steel is <em>dramatically</em> harder than iron, such that a good steel blade will bite – often surprisingly deeply – into an iron blade without much damage to itself.  Moreover, good steel can take fairly high energy impacts and simply bend to absorb the energy before springing back into its original shape (rather than, as with iron, having <em>plastic</em> deformation, where it bends, but doesn’t bend back – which is still better than <em>breaking</em>, but not much).  And for armor, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/">you may recall from our previous</a> look at arrow penetration, a steel plate’s ability to resist puncture is <em>much</em> higher than the same plate made of iron (bronze, by the by, performs about as well as iron, assuming both are work hardened).  of course, different applications still prefer different carbon contents; armor, for instance, tended to benefit from somewhat lower carbon content than a sword blade.</p>



<p>It is sometimes contended that the ancients did not know the difference between iron and steel.  This is mostly a philological argument based on the infrequency of a technical distinction between the two in ancient languages.  Latin authors will frequently use <em>ferrum</em> (iron) to mean both iron and steel; Greek will use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%2Fdhros&amp;highlight=iron">σίδηρος </a>(sideros, “iron”) much the same way.  The problem here is that high literature in the ancient world – which is almost all of the literature we have – has a strong aversion to technical terms <em>in general</em>; it would do no good for an elite writer to display knowledge more becoming to a tradesman than a senator.  That said in a handful of spots, Latin authors use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dchalybs1&amp;highlight=steel"><em>chalybs</em> </a>(from the Greek χάλυψ) to mean steel, as distinct from iron.</p>



<p>More to the point, while our elite authors – who are, at most dilettantish observers of metallurgy, never active participants – may or may not know the difference,<strong> ancient artisans clearly did</strong>.  As Tylecote (<em>op. cit.</em>) notes, we see surface carburization on tools as clearly as 1000 B.C. in the Levant and Egypt, although the extent of its use and intentionality is hard to gauge to due rust and damage. There is no such problem with Gallic metallurgy from at least the La Tène period (450 BCE – 50 B.C.) or Roman metallurgy from c. 200 B.C., because we see evidence of smiths quite deliberately varying carbon content over the different parts of sword-blades (more carbon in the edges, less in the core) through pattern welding, which itself can leave a tell-tale ‘streaky’ appearance to the blade (these streaks can be faked, but there’s little point in faking them if they are not already understood to signify a better weapon).  There can be little doubt that the smith who welds a steel edge to an iron core to make a sword blade understands that there is something <em>different</em> about that edge (especially since he cannot, as we can, precisely test the hardness of the two every time – he must know a method that <em>generally</em> produces harder metal and be working from that assumption; high carbon steel, properly produced, can be much harder than iron, as we’ll see).</p>

The sword itself has a mild steel core with high carbon steel edges and a thin coating of high-carbon steel along the flat.  Almost certainly the higher carbon edge was welded on to the mild steel core during manufacture, an example of a blacksmith quite intentionally using different grades of steel.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, our ancient – or even medieval – smiths do not understand the chemistry of all of this, of course.  Understanding the effects of carbuzation and how to harness that to make better tools must have been something learned through experience and experimentation, not from theoretical knowledge – a thing passed from master to apprentice, with only slight modification in each generation (though it is equally clear that techniques could move quite quickly over cultural boundaries, since smiths with an inferior technique need only imitate a superior one).</p>



<h2>Making Steel</h2>



<p>Now, in modern steel-making, the main problem is an excess of carbon.  Steel, when smelted in a blast furnace, tends to have far too much carbon.  Consequently a lot of modern iron-working is about walking the steel down to a usefully low amount of carbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking#Modern_processes">by getting excess carbon out of it</a>.  But ancient iron-working approaches the steeling problem from exactly the opposite direction, likely beginning with something close to a pure mass of iron and having to find ways to get more carbon into that iron to produce steel.</p>



<p><strong>So how do we take our carbon and get it into our iron?</strong>  Well, the good news is that the basic principle is actually very simple: <strong>when hot, iron will absorb carbon from the environment around it, although the process is quite slow</strong> if the iron is not molten (which it never is in these processes).  There are a few stages where that can happen and thus a few different ways of making steel out of our iron.</p>



<p>The popular assumption – in part because it was the working scholarly assumption for quite some time – is that iron can be at least partially …</p></div></div>

<p><abbr>oct 8</abbr></p>
<h2>Bye-bye, Apple</h2>
<p>The days of Apple products are behind me.
I had been developing on a Macbook for over
twelve years, but now, I’ve switched to an
ever trending setup: OpenBSD on a Thinkpad.</p>

<p>The new platform is a winner. Everything is
clean, quick, and configurable. When I 
<code>ps uaxww</code>, I’m not hogging ‘gigs’ of <abbr>RAM</abbr>
just to have things up and running. There’s
no black magic that derails me at every turn.
In short, my sanity has been long restored.</p>

<h3>What I miss</h3>


<p>Nothing is better than a fast web browser.
In Mac, this ‘<abbr>OS</abbr> within the <abbr>OS</abbr>’ was 
a mean beast. It certainly ran fast, but
the Chromium package for OpenBSD isn’t all
that bad.</p>

<p>That magnet power interface was a real win
with the Apple laptops. I miss that, in 
addition to speakers that could be maxed
out to their potential.</p>

<h3>On the other hand…</h3>


<p>There’s a healthy list of things I will
forever be glad to never have to deal 
with again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xcode</li>
<li>the omnipresent ‘Dock’ (never used it once)</li>
<li>the omnipresent ‘Finder’</li>
<li>‘.DS_Store’ files</li>
<li>black magic in the ‘Terminal.app’</li>
<li>Notifications (and its omnipresent menu hamburger icon)</li>
<li>App store</li>
<li>start-up chord</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve noticed that with every passing year, the
peripheral interface ports are dwindling. On
an older Macbook, I still had <em>some</em> options (<abbr>SD</abbr>
card reader, <abbr>USB2</abbr>, etc.). But lately, it’s out of
control.</p>

<p>On this middle-of-the-road Thinkpad, I have
an <abbr>SD</abbr> card reader,
<abbr>HDMI</abbr>, scads of <abbr>USB</abbr> ports, <abbr>RJ-45</abbr> —
I’m never going to need a dongle, or say the
word dongle, ever again now that Apple is 
out of my life.</p>

<h3>Home again</h3>


<p>My memory is pretty good. And I recall when
I got my first Mac product: it was because
there was no other decent option for
having a development laptop, but one
where Microsoft Windows wasn’t a requirement.</p>

<p>Many times I tried duct-taping a Linux
install on my various Macs, but things 
were ‘just not there.’ There was always
an issue with this or that, and it was
truly painful.</p>

<p>I think I lost the scent of the trail. 
OpenBSD works so well, I wonder how many
years I could have been using this great
<abbr>OS</abbr> outside of just the server world.</p>

<p>Of course, this setup isn’t for all. If
you’re green on the <abbr>UNIX</abbr> front, or
can’t read a manual, you’d be foolish 
to do it. For the others, it certainly
is a viable solution, to say the least.</p>

<p>I can honestly predict that I can see 
myself using this setup for twenty-five
more years. It’s like coming home to a
quiet, orderly house.</p>

<p>Open your heart to OpenBSD on Thinkpad
at your first opportunity.</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

The report states that, <em>“conditioning access to a product or service in which a firm has market power to the use of a separate product or service is anticompetitive.”</em></p><p>The report, which clocks in at a terrify 449 pages, investigates the issues of competition in the digital market. The report looks at companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and yes, Facebook. The report only mentions VR a small number of times, but it does go into detail about the large acquisitions of that each company has made. This includes Facebook’s purchase of Oculus in 2014.</p><p>The report states,</p><p><em>“Facebook has also maintained and expanded its dominance through a series of acquisitions of companies it viewed as competitive threats, and selectively excluded competitors from using its platform to insulate itself from competitive pressure.</em></p><p><em>Facebook has also maintained its monopoly through a series of anticompetitive business practices. The company used its data advantage to create superior market intelligence to identify nascent competitive threats and then acquire, copy, or kill these firms. Once dominant, Facebook selectively enforced its platform policies based on whether it perceived other companies as competitive threats. In doing so, it advantaged its own services while weakening other firms.”</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/Sidequest-New-Logo-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>This has major implications for the future of the Oculus and developers, we have seen Facebook flex their considerable power over smaller developers. We have previously reported on the issues that the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/unofficial-oculus-quest-appstore-receives-650-000-in-funding/">developer focused app store, Sidequest</a>, has had in gaining purchase in the Oculus ecosystem, not to mention the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/vr-developers-are-concerned-about-facebooks-walled-garden/">side-lining of the VR steaming service, Bigscreen</a>, by giving favourable terms to large companies like Fandango. With Facebook offering the most affordable headset on the market, we may see even more developers become disillusioned with the Oculus ecosystem and move on to greener pastures.</p>

<p><img src="https://stdw.github.io/cm-sdr/img/modem.jpg" alt="cable modem"></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I got curious about an old cable modem sitting in my closet,
a Motorola MB7220. Initially I was interested in what kind of hardware it had
and if it was running Linux. Some quick searching brought me to a thread on
a web forum where people were discussing the built in spectrum analyzer feature
used for diagnostics. Someone mentioned that they could see spikes
corresponding to FM radio stations. This sparked a thought: if a cable modem 
and a digital TV tuner dongle are fundamentally doing the same thing (receiving 
and demodulating QAM signals), could a modem be turned into an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio">SDR (software-defined radio)</a>
a la <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/">RTL-SDR</a>?</p>

<p>Going into this project, I knew next to nothing about RF and had no idea if
this goal was even feasible at all for the hardware. I found 
<a href="http://www.hermeslite.com/">an SDR project</a> based on an Analog Devices 
cable modem chip, as well as a <a href="https://forums.qrz.com/index.php?threads/cable-modem-to-software-defined-radio-modification-projects.512433/">forum thread</a>
where someone else was wondering about the same thing a few years ago.</p>

<p>The last post in the thread from user VK4HAT states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I say if you have the skills, time and desire, give it a go and see where you end up. If google shows nothing, then its likely not been tried. With so few firsts available in life, take those that present themselves and have a crack, even if failure is always an option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that is exactly what I did.</p>

<h2 id="gaining-access">Gaining Access</h2>
<p>My first goal was to look for an access vector or a way to communicate with the
device. I knew that there wasn’t much to see on the web interface and telnet
was disabled, so I skipped ahead to opening it up.</p>

<p>After removing a few screws from the plastic housing to get access to the
board, my first thought was to look for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> headers to take a peek at the serial console. 
After identifying two candidates consisting of four vias surrounded by a 
rectangle near the edge of the PCB, it was time to identify the pins. 
Using a multimeter, the ground pin can be easily identified by checking 
the continuity with one of the metal shields on board. The VCC pin can be 
identified by measuring the voltage of each pin when powering on the board. 
It should be a steady 3.3v, or in some cases 1.8v or 5v. This pin is not 
needed, but is still useful to identify the operating voltage and eliminate 
one candidate for the Tx and Rx pins.
While booting, the Tx pin will sit on average a little lower than the VCC pin
and drop much lower when a lot of data is being output. This leaves the last 
pin as Rx.</p>

<p>One of the UARTs identified earlier did not seem to be transmitting anything
while the other did. After soldering some wires to the active UART, I connected
the Tx to UART Rx GPIO pin on a Raspberry Pi, the Rx to the Pi’s Tx, and the 
ground to the ground pin. Note that this can only be done because both systems
are 3.3v. Had that not been the case, a USB TTL adapter with an adjustable 
voltage level could be used just as easily, and is probably a better idea most
of the time anyway.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why the Raspberry Pi is not the best serial interface
such as if you need parity or other features, but in this case I had it on hand
and it works. The serial console of the Pi must also be disabled so that it can 
be freed up for other purposes. There is another reason I chose to use the 
Raspberry Pi which I will get to later.</p>

<p>Finally, to actually see the data I used the <code>cu</code> utility:<br>
<code>cu -l /dev/serial0 -s 115200</code><br>
The baud rate was a lucky guess, but 115200 is very common on such devices.
If the baud rate is wrong you will quickly know when you see a bunch of garbage
on the screen. A logic analyzer could be used to definitively find the baud 
rate and other parameters, but guessing is sometimes quicker and always 
cheaper.</p>

<p>After powering on the device, the terminal filled with output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pi@raspberrypi:~/modem $ cu -l /dev/serial0 -s 115200

<p>This output contains a wealth of information. The device is 
running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECos">eCos</a> on a MIPS processor 
which is part of a Broadcom BCM3383 SoC. It turns out there are actually
two MIPS processors on this SoC although one of them is not used on this
modem, explaining the other UART. On some devices, the second processor
will run Linux for additional features.</p>

<p>Also, this seems like the end of the line for serial because shortly after 
booting the actual OS, it disables the serial console. Hitting “p” at the 
bootloader prompt does not lead to much except a way to download new OS 
images via tftp and a utility to read and write memory addresses. This could
be used to bypass the check, but a much greater understanding of the OS and
memory layout would be required.</p>

<h2 id="dumping-the-flash">Dumping the flash</h2>

<p>My goal now was to enable the serial console. Examination of the board reveals
a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a> flash
chip which likely contains the bootloader, OS, and configuration as it is the
only non-volatile storage visible on the board.</p>

<p>This is where the Raspberry Pi comes in handy once again. The GPIO header also
conveniently contains a SPI interface which can be used to read the data off
of the flash chip.</p>

<p>Searching the number on the chip, “winbond 25Q32JV”, yields the datasheet
containing the pinout. The important ones are VCC, Chip Select (CS), Clock
(CLK), Data Out (DO), Data In (DI), and ground.</p>

<p>One common issue with dumping a SPI chip on a board is that the chip requires
power, but this will also usually power the board and cause it to start booting
and using the chip. I chose to overcome this by heating the VCC pin with my
soldering iron and very carefully lifting it off the pad. This is a convenient,
but rather crude solution which may result in snapped off leads so use at your
own risk! I also soldered a jumper wire to the pad and another to the floating
leg so that I could easily connect and disconnect them and allow the device to
boot again.</p>

<p>Another note, on some boards the Chip Select pin is assumed to always be 
enabled so it is directly tied to VCC. This means when you power the CS 
pin, the board also starts booting. This can be solved in a similar way
to the VCC pin.</p>

<p>Now, wires can be soldered to the rest of the pins and the they can be
connected to the Raspberry Pi. The ground goes to ground (the UART ground
from earlier can also be used), the VCC to the Pi’s 3.3v pin. (Again, it is
critical to verify with the datasheet that this is a 3.3v chip because the Pi
only supports 3.3v). The DO pin is connected to the Pi’s SPI <code>MISO</code> (master in 
slave out) pin and DI to the <code>MOSI</code> pin (master out slave in). Lastly, the 
Clock is connected to the <code>SCLK</code> GPIO pin and the Chip Select to the <code>CE0</code> pin.</p>

<p>To actually read the chip, there is a fantastic tool called 
<a href="https://flashrom.org/Flashrom">flashrom</a> which supports an enormous number of
chips. <code>flashrom</code> is present in the repos of many distributions including that
of the Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian).</p>

<p>Luckily the W25Q32JV is supported, under the name “W25Q32.V”. A quick check on
the flashrom wiki shows the size and voltage match what is expected and that
the chip is fully supported.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, ensure that the SPI interface on the Pi is enabled by
using the <code>raspi-config</code> utility and checking under “Interfacing Options”.</p>

<p>At last we can read the chip. First verify that it is …</p></section></div></div>

Companies that deliver DL solutions (such as Amazon, Tesla, Salesforce) are at the forefront of stock markets and attract impressive investments. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/621468/worldwide-artificial-intelligence-startup-company-funding-by-year/">Statista</a>, the total funding of artificial intelligence startup companies worldwide in 2014–2019 is equal to more than $26 billion.

Deep learning is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20feature%20learning,or%20classification%20from%20raw%20data.">representation learning</a>. Instead of using task-specific algorithms, it learns from representative examples. For example, if you want to build a model that recognizes cats by species, you need to prepare a database that includes a lot of different cat images.</p><p>The main architectures of deep learning are:</p><ul>
<li>Convolutional neural networks</li>

</tbody></table><h2 id="advantages-of-deep-learning">Advantages of deep learning</h2><p>Now that you know what the difference between DL and ML is, let us look at some advantages of deep learning.</p><ul>
<li>In 2015, a group of Google engineers was conducting research about <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html">how NN carry out classification tasks</a>. By chance, they also noticed that neural networks can hallucinate and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUOdu_5MPc&amp;t=932s">produce rather interesting art</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to identify patterns and anomalies in large volumes of raw data enables deep learning to efficiently deliver accurate and reliable analysis results to professionals. For example, Amazon has more than <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/amazon-sales/">560 million items on the website and 300+ million users</a>. No human accountant or even a whole army of accountants would be able to track that many transactions without an AI tool.</li>
<li>Deep learning doesn’t rely on human expertise as much as traditional machine learning. DL allows us to make discoveries in data even when the developers are not sure what they are trying to find. For example, you want your algorithms to be able to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-deep-learning-model-to-predict-employee-retention-using-keras-and-tensorflow">predict customer retention</a>, but you’re not sure which characteristics of a customer will enable the system to make this prediction.</li>
</ul><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/b3/b37v6nzo.2_(24)_(1).jpg" alt="Deep learning advantages"></p><h2 id="problems-of-deep-learning">Problems of deep learning</h2><ul>
<li>Large amounts of quality data are resource-consuming to collect. For many years, the largest and best-prepared collection of samples was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/worlds-largest-image-database-to-help-computers-learn-to-see/#:~:text=To%20develop%20a%20system%20that,holds%2014%20million%20labeled%20images.">ImageNet with 14 million different images</a> and more than 20,000 categories. It was founded in 2012, and only last year, <a href="https://neurohive.io/en/datasets/tencent-dataset/">Tencent released a database</a> that is larger and more versatile.</li>
<li>Another difficulty with deep learning technology is that it cannot provide reasons for its conclusions. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the performance of the model if you are not aware of what the output is supposed to be. Unlike in traditional machine learning, you will not be able to test the algorithm and find out why your system decided that, for example, it is a cat in the picture and not a dog.</li>
<li>It is very costly to build deep learning algorithms. It is impossible without qualified staff who are trained to work with sophisticated maths. Moreover, deep learning is a resource-intensive technology. It requires powerful GPUs and a lot of memory to train the models. A lot of memory is needed to store input data, weight parameters, and activation functions as an input propagates through the network. Sometimes deep learning algorithms become so power-hungry that researchers prefer to use <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/how-to-choose-ml-technique">other algorithms</a>, even sacrificing the accuracy of predictions.</li>
</ul><p>However, in many cases, deep learning cannot be substituted.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VH1Lim8gL8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="how-can-you-apply-dl-to-real-life-problems%3F">How can you apply DL to real-life problems?</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/66/66a4xqmg.4_(18)_(1).jpg" alt="Deep learning applications"></p><p>Today, deep learning is applied across different industries for various use cases:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Speech recognition.</strong> All major commercial speech recognition systems (like Microsoft Cortana, Alexa, Google assistant, Apple Siri) are based on deep learning-based.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern recognition.</strong> Pattern recognition systems are already able to give more accurate results than the human eye in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50857759#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20is%20more%20accurate,images%20from%20nearly%2029%2C000%20women.">medical diagnosis</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Natural language processing.</strong> Neural networks have been used to implement language models since the early 2000s. The invention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">LSTM</a> helped improve machine translation and language modeling.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery of new drugs.</strong> For example, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02855">AtomNet neural network</a> has been used to predict new biomolecules that can potentially cure diseases such as Ebola and multiple sclerosis.</li>
<li><strong>Recommender systems.</strong> Today, deep learning is being used to study user preferences across many domains. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> is one of the brightest examples in this field.</li>
</ul><h2 id="what-are-artificial-neural-networks%3F">What are artificial neural networks?</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/vd/vd78l0x8.deviator-2_(1).jpg" alt="What are artificial neural networks"></p><p>“Artificial neural networks” and “deep learning” are often used interchangeably, which isn’t really correct. Not all neural networks are “deep”, meaning “with many hidden layers”, and not all deep learning architectures are neural networks. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_belief_network#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20a%20deep,between%20units%20within%20each%20layer.">deep belief networks</a>, for example.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/vk/vkpzrxrf.5_(12)_(1).jpg" alt="neural networks"></p><p>However, since neural networks are the most hyped algorithms right now and are, in fact, very useful for solving complex tasks, we are going to talk about them in this post.</p><h3 id="definition-of-an-ann">Definition of an ANN</h3><p>An artificial neural network is heavily inspired by the structure of a human brain. Simply put, an ANN represents a sequence of neurons connected by synapses. Those sequences are often organized into layers.</p><p>Having many (sometimes millions) of input neurons in the system, the machine learns to analyze and even memorize various information. Due to this structure, a neural network can process monstrous amounts of information very fast.</p><p>Here is a video for those who want to dive deeper into the technical details of how artificial neural networks work.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njKP3FqW3Sk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Artificial neural networs are incredibly valuable not only to analyze incoming information but also to reproduce it from their memory.</p><h2 id="components-of-neural-networks">Components of Neural Networks</h2><p>Every neural network consists of neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.</p><h3 id="neurons">Neurons</h3><p>A neuron or a node of a neural network is a computing unit that receives information, performs simple calculations with it, and passes it further.</p><p>All neurons in a net are divided into three groups:</p><ul>
<li>Input neurons that receive information from the outside world;</li>
<li>Hidden neurons that process that information;</li>
<li>Output neurons that produce a conclusion.</li>
</ul><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/yt/ytl4jey2.6_(8)_(1).jpg" alt="ML architecture"></p><p>In a large neural network with many neurons and connections between them, neurons are organized in layers. An input layer receives information, n hidden layers (at least 3+) process it, and an output layer provides some result.</p><p>Each of the neurons inputs and outputs some data. If this is the first layer, input = output. In other cases, the information that the neurons have received from the previous layer is passed to input. Then, it uses an activation function to get a new output, which is passed to the next layer of neurons in the system.</p><p>Neurons only operate numbers in the range [0,1] or [-1,1]. In order to turn data into something that a neuron can work with, we need normalization. We talked about what it is in the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/regression-analysis-overview">post about regression analysis</a>.</p><p>Wait, but how do neurons communicate? Through synapses.</p><h3 id="synapses-and-weights">Synapses and weights</h3><p>If we didn’t have synapses, we would be stuck with a bunch of inactive useless neurons. A synapse is a connection between two neurons. Every synapse has a weight. It is the weight that changes the input information while it is transmitted from one neuron to another. The neuron with the greater weight will be dominant in the next neuron. One can say that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_matrix">matrix of weights</a> is the brain of the whole neural system.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/b9/b92z8vod.7_(9)_(1).jpg" alt="Neuron weights"></p><p>It is thanks to these weights that the input information is processed and converted into a result. During the initialization (first launch of the NN), the weights are randomly assigned. Later on, they are optimized.</p><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>A bias neuron allows for more variations of weights to be stored. Biases add richer representation of the input space to the model’s weights.</p><p>In the case of neural networks, a bias neuron is added to every layer. It plays a vital role by making it possible to move the activation function to the left or right on the graph.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ey/eyarbo1y.8_(5)_(1).jpg" alt="bias neurons"></p><p>It is true that ANNs can work without bias neurons. However, they are almost always added and counted as an indispensable part of the overall model.</p><h2 id="how-anns-work">How ANNs work</h2><p>Every neuron processes input data to extract a feature. Let’s imagine that we have features x1, x2, x3, and three neurons, each of which is connected with all these features.</p><p>Each of the neurons has its own weights that are used to weight the features. During the training of the network, you need to select such weights for each of the neurons that the output provided by the whole network would be true-to-life.</p><p>To perform transformations and get an output, every neuron has an activation function. It allows us to get some new feature space. This combination of functions performs a transformation that is described by a common function F — this describes the formula behind the NN’s magic.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ly/ly9z5sh4.9_(3)_(1).jpg" alt="ANN: activation function"></p><p>There are a lot of activation functions, …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>October  8, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've linked to the <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/links/SingleUnixSpecification">Single Unix Specification</a> any number of times, for various versions
of it (when I first linked to it, it was at issue 6, in 2006; it's
now up to <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">a 2018 edition</a>). But I've never
been quite clear what it covered and didn't cover, and how it related
to POSIX and similar things. After <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/DiffOldArgumentsFeature">yesterday's entry</a> got me looking at the SuS site again, I
decided to try to sort this out once and for all.</p>

<p>My primary resources on this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">the Wikipedia page</a> (<a href="https://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/single_unix_faq.html">the
SuS FAQ</a>
claims to be updated recently but is clearly out of date in important
respects). Also useful is the page of <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/austin/">the Austin Commons Standards
Revision Group</a> (<a href="https://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/posix_faq.html">also</a>). The
Wikipedia page has a helpful rundown of the history of the 'Single
Unix Specification' and some things related to them.</p>

<p>As stated by various places, the core of the Single Unix Specification
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>, which is formally
an IEEE standard and also an international ISO/IEC standard (IEEE
1003 and ISO/IEC 9945 respectively). POSIX incorporates by reference
some vintage of ANSI C (I believe C99), since the Unix APIs it
specifies are specified in C. The POSIX standard covers both C
library APIs, commands that are executed through the shell (which
is also specified in POSIX), and I believe things like <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap10.html">some file
paths</a>.
As far as I can tell, the only other standard in the Single Unix
Specification is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">CURSES</a>, which
is not part of POSIX.</p>

<p>(See eg <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/unix">here Unix standards</a>, <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/austin/papers/single_unix_faq.html">the FAQ</a>, and
Wikipedia.)</p>

<p>This implies that if a Unix command or a non-Curses API is in the
Single Unix Specification, it's also in POSIX. This matches what
I've seen in the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">online Single Unix Specification</a> that I keep
linking to bits of; I've only ever noticed it talking about POSIX
(aka IEEE 1003.1). For most purposes, then, I can just talk about
'POSIX' or 'Single Unix Specification' interchangeably, which is
somewhat different than how I used to think it was.</p>

<p>(I originally thought that the SuS was a superset of POSIX that
added significant extra commands and requirements that were not in
POSIX. This appears to not be the case.)</p>

<h3>Sidebar: Where my misunderstanding of SuS came from</h3>

<p>How I thought the story went was that POSIX was a relatively minimal
standard for 'Unix' that did not go far enough in practice, for
various political reasons. This caused actual Unix vendors to get
together and agree on an additional layer of things on top of
POSIX that made up 'Unix in practice', creating the Single Unix
Specification. Systems that were in no way Unix derived could be
POSIX compliant if they tried (and so could be candidates for US
government contracts that required 'POSIX', per <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/POSIXOriginStory">the origins of
POSIX as I learned them</a>), but could not be Unixâ„¢,
which was something that was defined by the Single Unix Specification.</p>

<p>Obviously this is not actually the case, or at least is not the
case in modern versions of the SuS. This goes to show me, once
again, the power of folklore (especially since I fell for it).</p>

<pre><strong><a href="https://aboutintel.eu/automated-video-surveillance">Discussion Prompt</a><a href="https://aboutintel.eu/predictive-policing">:</a> </strong>Should we ban the use of automated 
video-surveillance?

<a href="https://aboutintel.eu/automated-video-surveillance">See all contributions to this question.</a></pre>







<p><em>Modern video surveillance is a far cry from its clumsy predecessor. As technology has improved, and camera prices plummeted, surveillance en masse is likely coming to a city near you. Belgrade is one such city, experiencing the roll-out of thousands of cameras as part of a so-called “Safe Society” project. Installed without any public debate, nor a strong legal framework protecting digital and civil rights, concern by local civil society is high. Facial recognition in public spaces is one tool to fight crime, but residents must ask themselves, should this highly intrusive measure trump the privacy of all citizens</em>?</p>



<hr>



<p>Mass biometric surveillance can adversely affect a society — especially if in the case of Serbia, it is one with an already weak democratic tradition — and can cause serious violations of human rights. This is why it should be banned.</p>



<p>The digital age has brought about the idea that technology can exclusively be a force for good, helping us achieve nearly crime-free societies and peace among nations. Whether it’s preventing terrorist attacks or combating organised crime, one answer has been more surveillance of communications and the movements of citizens – most of whom are law-abiding. Now, entering the 2020s, the next targets of surveillance are our <em>faces</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br><strong>Thousands of new eyes for Belgrade</strong></p>



<p>Citizens of the Serbian capital Belgrade learned in early 2019 that their city will be covered with a thousand<a href="https://www.sharefoundation.info/en/new-surveillance-cameras-in-belgrade-location-and-human-rights-impact-analysis-withheld/"> <span>cutting-edge surveillance cameras</span></a> in the following two years as part of the so-called “Safe Society” project. The project was unveiled without any prior public debate.<em> </em>What especially caught the public’s attention was the fact that these cameras — supplied by<a href="https://www.sharefoundation.info/en/huawei-knows-everything-about-cameras-in-belgrade-and-they-are-glad-to-share/"> <span>Chinese tech giant Huawei</span></a> — will have facial and vehicle license plate recognition capabilities. The news was declared by high-ranking officials in internal affairs, the Police Director of Serbia and the Minister of Interior. The latter is one of the key figures of the ruling party and a close associate of President Vučić, which gave the announcement particular ‘weight’ in public. Since then, a citizen initiative known as<a href="https://hiljade.kamera.rs/en/home/"> <span>“Thousands of Cameras” (“Hiljade kamera”)</span></a>, led by SHARE Foundation — a non-profit organisation dedicated to protecting digital rights, which I work for — has been actively challenging this surveillance system and demanding that such an intrusive technology be discussed in an open and inclusive setting before it is introduced.</p>



<p>Serbia does not have a long democratic tradition and features a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/serbia/kosovo"><span>problematic human rights record</span></a> to this day. As a remnant of socialist Yugoslavia, which prioritised safety and security, privacy awareness is very low for most of the population. The country’s recent democratic backslide is also quite alarming. Earlier this year,<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2020/dropping-democratic-facade"> <span>Freedom House</span></a> downgraded Serbia to a Transitional/Hybrid regime for the first time since 2003. On the<a href="https://rsf.org/en/serbia"> <span>World Press Freedom Index</span></a> for 2020, Serbia is ranked 93rd out of 180 countries – another 3 places down from the previous year. In its report, Reporters Without Borders <a href="https://rsf.org/en/serbia"><span>states</span></a> that “Serbia has become a country where it is often dangerous to be a journalist”. Data protection and privacy do not rest on a long political tradition. A data protection law has existed in Serbia for just over a decade and the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection (the national data protection authority) was established only 16 years ago, at first as a freedom of information complaints body. Furthermore, video surveillance in Serbia — a country currently negotiating EU membership — has seen its fair share of controversy, with camera footage often being abused, leaked in the pro-government media, or the cameras ‘conveniently’ not working at key moments (i.e. when powerful individuals could have been compromised by the footage).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the city administration’s infrastructure strategy is quite unpopular, the citizens of Belgrade, despite a general privacy lethargy, have paid attention to the new surveillance system; citizens and “Thousands of Cameras” activists<a href="https://hiljade.kamera.rs/map/"> <span>have mapped hundreds of locations</span></a> across Belgrade where cameras have been installed. This form of crowdsourcing provides more information about surveilled locations than the police itself has published. Photos of cameras from various Belgrade neighbourhoods are regularly posted on the<a href="https://twitter.com/hiljadekamera"> <span>“Thousands of Cameras” Twitter feed</span></a>. With this alarming spread of cameras, we have to ask what the deeper implications of such surveillance are? And can it cause or cement irreversible changes in a world of declining democratic values, particularly in a country like Serbia?</p>



<p><br><strong>The legal framework</strong></p>



<p>Serbia has modernised its data protection legal framework by adopting the new Law on Personal Data Protection (LPDP) in late 2018; its full application began in November 2019. Drafted from a confusing mix of translated GDPR regulations and the EU Law Enforcement Directive, the text of Serbia’s new LPDP was controversial from the start, but at least it provided a more modern approach to data protection. Among its main flaws however, is the fact that the new LPDP does not specifically regulate two important aspects of data processing: biometric data and video-surveillance. Despite this, the law’s general provisions and principles should still apply to any data processing, such as a massive video surveillance system across Belgrade.</p>



<p>Before deploying a public space surveillance system, the LPDP obliges the data controller to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and ask for the Commissioner’s opinion. However the Ministry of Interior of Serbia, which is the implementing body for the “Safe Society” project, failed to comply with the LPDP. It issued two DPIAs, both of which did not satisfy the Commissioner, who refused to approve. Despite this, the cameras were installed anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest information gathered from the second DPIA of the Ministry suggests that there will be<a href="https://www.sharefoundation.info/wp-content/uploads/Mini1000.png"> </a>more than 8000 different <a href="https://www.sharefoundation.info/wp-content/uploads/Mini1000.png"><span>cameras and other devices</span></a> in use, such as body cams, mobile cameras and vehicle-mounted cameras. Although facial recognition, i.e. automated detection of people’s faces from a video feed, is not yet rolled out by the Ministry, this feature is expected to be implemented by the end of the project. While little is known about the project’s timeline, this can be expected to be in the next two years.</p>



<p>Apart from the data protection issues related to facial recognition, we also need to ask whether these technologies are necessary and proportionate, particularly from the perspective of the European human rights framework and its underlying values. Is facial recognition in public spaces the only available measure that can be used to prevent serious crime and protect citizens? Can this highly intrusive measure trump the privacy of all citizens, effectively turning whole cities into mass surveillance zones?</p>



<p>All in all, the Belgrade surveillance camera system is of <a href="https://hiljade.kamera.rs/en/law-society/">dubious legality</a>, to say the least, because:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>the actual purpose of introducing this system has not been clearly defined;&nbsp;</li><li>it has not been confirmed that the use of this system is necessary for the operations of state bodies;&nbsp;</li><li>its positive influence on the reduction of criminal offences has been overrated and its use is not proportionate to the risks related to the rights and freedom of citizens;&nbsp;</li><li>there is no law to begin with that defines that the police have the right to use smart surveillance in public places; and&nbsp;</li><li>the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) of the Ministry of Interior does not meet formal and material conditions defined by the law and was not approved by the Commissioner.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p><br><strong>Point of no return for human rights</strong></p>



<p>Automated biometric video-surveillance may be the pinnacle of today’s<a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/the-folly-of-technological-solutionism-an-interview-with-evgeny-morozov/"> <span>techno-solutionism</span></a> – trying to solve deep and complex social problems with often non-critical use of technology. Sadly, decision makers are usually blind to issues of ethical and legal nature, and far-reaching consequences, if a society sets public safety as its ultimate value. It is all the more troubling if they believe it can be achieved with technology such as mass video-surveillance. Once governments get a hold of such powerful technology, it might be impossible to completely remove it from their arsenal, even after successful legal challenges. In that regard, we can draw a parallel to blanket communications metadata retention — a highly controversial measure in terms of proportionality which is<a href="https://edri.org/eu-member-states-willing-to-retain-illegal-data-retention/"> <span>still alive and kicking in the EU</span></a>, despite two CJEU judgements against it.<sup>1 </sup>Not to mention lucrative infrastructure deals required to install a massive video surveillance network, possibly in every larger city. This is particularly worrisome for countries such as Serbia, which are currently experiencing democratic backslides.</p>



<p>In addition to privacy, other associated human rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and the rights to protest and peaceful gathering, would<a href="https://edri.org/facial-recognition-and-fundamental-rights-101/"> <span>also be affected</span></a> in areas covered with automated video-surveillance. Imagine a scenario where a government keeps a biometric database of all citizens who attended anti-government protests; the ways in which this could affect their work, families, social relationships, and other aspects of everyday life are vast. Facial recognition also<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/"> <span>discriminates against minorities</span></a>, further entrenching bias against disadvantaged communities and making them more vulnerable.</p>



<p>With its high risks and numerous adverse effects, especially once reaching a “point-of-no-return”, automated biometric video surveillance does not uphold the values of respect for human rights, equality and social justice of the EU and the Council of Europe. Therefore, banning automated video surveillance is the right step forward, especially when we take into account other worrying trends, such as <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/2020/02/04/technopolice-resisting-the-total-surveillance-of-our-cities-and-of-our-lives/"><span>the total …</span></a></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The three main types of comments in Clojure are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters#_comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a></li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters#_discard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discard comment</a></li>
<li><a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment macro</a> (<code>Rich Comment</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one, the <code>Rich Comment</code>, is a pretty cool feature of Clojure.</p>

<p>The first type of comment is a literal <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters#_comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a></p>

<p>Anything that follows the <code>;</code> is ignored by Clojure until the end of the line.  A common use for the <code>comment</code> is to help future humans understand our code better<a href="#comments" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="comments-ref">.</a></p>

<p>The second type of comment is a <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/weird_characters#_discard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discard comment</a></p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span>     

<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> <span>inc</span> #_ <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span>  </code></pre></div>
<p>In the above code, the <code>#_</code> makes it as if the second <code>inc</code> doesn't exist<a href="#wonderful-life" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="wonderful-life-ref">.</a>  This is great for debugging because the <code>discard</code> comment doesn't return a value.  In addition to this, there are two additional usage notes about the <code>discard comment</code>.</p>
<p>The first is that they nest:</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_ <span>inc</span> #_ <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span> 
<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_ #_ <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here are some examples of where you might find the <code>discard comment</code> useful:</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>or</span> #_ <span>(</span>int? <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>nil?</span> <span>"Thomas"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>my-number <span>5</span>
      #_ #_ another-number <span>13</span><span>]</span>
  
  <span>)</span>

<span>{</span>#_ #_ <span>:name</span> <span>"Between Two Parens"</span> <span>:host</span> <span>"Thomas"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second take away is that you don't have to add spaces after the <code>discard comment</code>:</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code>
<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_ <span>inc</span> #_ <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span> 
<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_inc #_inc <span>inc</span><span>)</span>   

<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_ #_ <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span> 
<span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>5</span> #_#_inc <span>inc</span> <span>inc</span><span>)</span>   </code></pre></div>

<p>The difference between adding the space or removing the space is which one <em>you</em> find more readable<a href="#discard-comment-credit" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="discard-comment-credit-ref">.</a></p>

<p>Finally, we have the <code>comment macro</code> which is more affectionatley known as a <code>Rich Comment Block</code>:</p>

<p>The first time I heard of a <code>Rich Comment</code> was in Stuart Halloway's excellent talk <a href="https://youtu.be/Qx0-pViyIDU?t=1229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Running With Scissors</a> where he notes:</p>

<p>Yet, even after watching <code>Running With Scissors</code> the use of the <code>Rich Comment</code> hadn't started to click yet.  Two more things would need to happen:  The first, I would witness REPL Driven Development used in person by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/swannodette" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Nolen</a>.  The second, I would start to use REPL Driven Development in my own workflow.  When I did these things, I was able to better see the benefits of the <code>comment macro</code> as</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>a save point</li>
<li>code setup</li>
<li>improved code exploration</li>
<li>preservation of syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>With that, let's review a few examples of the <code>Rich Comment</code> from real life Clojure codebases<a href="#example-comments" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="example-comments-ref">.</a></p>
<p>The first example illusrates the <code>documentation</code> and <code>save point</code> ideas.</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span>

<span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span>sh <span>"ls"</span> <span>"-l"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span>sh <span>"ls"</span> <span>"-l"</span> <span>"/no-such-thing"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span>sh <span>"sed"</span> <span>"s/[aeiou]/oo/g"</span> <span>:in</span> <span>"hello there\n"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span>sh <span>"sed"</span> <span>"s/[aeiou]/oo/g"</span> <span>:in</span> <span>(</span>java.io.StringReader. <span>"hello there\n"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above comes from the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/4ef4b1ed7a2e8bb0aaaacfb0942729252c2c3091/src/clj/clojure/java/shell.clj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clojure codebase</a> itself and is a code example of how to use <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.java.shell/sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sh</a>.  For me, the value is that we have an example of how to use <code>sh</code> (<code>documentation</code>) and we have some code ready for us to run through our REPL (<code>a save point</code>). This idea of having a <code>save point</code> becomes more powerful in the next example:</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span>
  <span>(</span><span>do</span>
   <span>(</span>require '<span>[</span>my.app.<span>db</span> <span>:as</span> app.<span>db</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span>require '<span>[</span>my.app.cart <span>:as</span> cart<span>]</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>db</span> <span>(</span>app.<span>db</span>/connection!<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>(</span>cart/<span>add</span> <span>db</span> <span>{</span><span>:item-name</span> <span>"iPhone"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
  
  <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above builds on the idea of having a <code>save point</code> and layers on some <code>code setup</code> helpers.  What the above does is add in a few lines of code which, when run, will provide us with a <code>db connection</code>. Through this, I can quickly begin interacting with my app's database code and building out features.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other types of setup code that you may want.  For example, you might be working on a pure function which is just going to transform some data.  In this case, we might setup a <code>comment</code> like this:</p>
<div data-language="clojure"><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span>
<span>(</span><span>refer</span> <span>'set</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span> xs #<span>{</span><span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>11</span> <span>:b</span> <span>1</span> <span>:c</span> <span>1</span> <span>:d</span> <span>4</span><span>}</span>
         <span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>2</span> <span>:b</span> <span>12</span> <span>:c</span> <span>2</span> <span>:d</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>
         <span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>3</span> <span>:b</span> <span>3</span> <span>:c</span> <span>3</span> <span>:d</span> <span>8</span> <span>:f</span> <span>42</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>def</span> ys #<span>{</span><span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>11</span> <span>:b</span> <span>11</span> <span>:c</span> <span>11</span> <span>:e</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span>
         <span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>12</span> <span>:b</span> <span>11</span> <span>:c</span> <span>12</span> <span>:e</span> <span>3</span><span>}</span>
         <span>{</span><span>:a</span> <span>3</span> <span>:b</span> <span>3</span> <span>:c</span> <span>3</span> <span>:e</span> <span>7</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>join</span> xs ys<span>)</span>

<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above is the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/4ef4b1ed7a2e8bb0aaaacfb0942729252c2c3091/src/clj/clojure/set.clj#L158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example Stuart provided</a> in his talk which provides us with some sample data allowing us to immediately begin using our functions to transform said data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are just a few examples of how to use a <code>Rich Comment Block</code>.  The most interesting part of the <code>Rich Comment Block</code> for me is that it's a tangible example of the pragmatism of Clojure.  In this case, the <code>comment macro</code> provides an additional mechanism for speeding up my workflow and making our code more maintainable overall because of the improved documentation and context we get from these comments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; The feature store is a data warehouse of features for machine learning (ML). Architecturally, it differs from the traditional data warehouse in that it is a dual-database, with one database (row-oriented) serving features at low latency to online applications and the other database (column-oriented) storing large volumes of features, used by Data Scientists to create train/test datasets and by batch applications doing offline model scoring.</p><h2>Features Store: Data Warehouse Déjà Vu</h2><p>Data warehouses democratized access to Enterprise data by centralizing data in a single platform and then empowering business analysts with visual tools, such as Tableau and Power BI. No longer did they need to know what data resides where and how to query that data in that platform. They could derive historical insights into the business using BI tools.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Data scientists, in contrast, build predictive models to derive business insights. The feature store is the data warehouse for Data Science - it is a central vault for storing documented, curated, and access-controlled features that can be used across many different models. The feature store ingests data from the Enterprise’s many different sources after transforming, aggregating, and validating the data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Feature pipelines need to be written to ensure that data reliably flows from existing sources and is available in a format ready to be consumed by ML training pipelines and models.</p><p>Most Data Scientists currently do not have a feature store. They spend most of their time looking for, cleaning, and featurizing data. Hence, the (very real) cliché that 80% of data science is data wrangling. Data Scientists without a feature store work in an era akin to how business analysts worked before the advent of data warehouses, with low individual and organizational productivity.</p><h2>The Data Warehouse is an input <br>to the Feature Store&nbsp;</h2><p>Both platforms are a central store of curated data used to generate insights into the data. Both platforms have pipelines (ETL and feature pipelines, respectively) to ingest data from one or more disparate sources (operational databases, data lakes, etc).</p><p>Both benefit from metadata catalogs to organize data sets and access control to share data with only authorized actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Both platforms can be designed to scale-out on commodity hardware and store large volumes of data, although typically a data warehouse stores only relevant to analysis (modern <a href="#">data lakehouses</a> are designed to store large volumes of data more cost efficiently).<em>‍</em></p><figure id="w-node-d225d8bb42d9-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f7eed8f6ff9277909bd9c6e_visual_blog5.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Feature Store as a Dual Database</h2><p>The main architectural difference between a data warehouse and a feature store is that the data warehouse is typically a single columnar database, while the feature store is typically implemented as two databases:</p><ul role="list"><li>an <strong>offline feature store</strong> for serving large batches of features to (1) create train/test datasets and (2) batch applications scoring models using those batches of features, and</li><li>an <strong>online feature store</strong> for serving a single row of features (a <em>feature vector</em>) to be used as input features for an online model for an individual prediction.<br></li></ul><p><strong>The offline feature store</strong> is typically required to efficiently serve and store large amounts of feature data, <strong>while the online feature store</strong> is required to return feature vectors in very low latency (e.g., &lt; 10ms). Examples of databases used for the offline feature store are Apache Hive and BigQuery and examples of online feature stores include MySQL Cluster, Redis, and DynamoDB.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that if you want to reuse features in different train/test datasets for different models, your database or application will need to join features together. This is true for both the offline and online feature stores. If your feature store does not support joining features, that is, you do not reuse features across different models, you (or some system) will need to create a new ingestion pipeline for every new model you support in production.</p><figure id="w-node-fbcf667874fd-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f7eee044a3a1d737610fc25_visual_blog4.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Detailed Comparison</h2><p>In the table below, we see an overview of the main architectural differences between feature stores and data warehouses.<strong> Data warehouses</strong> are used primarily by business analysts for interactive querying and for generating historical reports/dashboards on the business.<strong> Feature stores</strong> are used by both data scientists and by the online/batch applications, and they are fed data by feature pipelines, typically written in Python or Scala/Java.&nbsp;</p><p>Data scientists typically use Python programs to create train/test datasets by joining existing features in the feature store together and materializing the train/test datasets in a <a href="#">file format best suited to the framework</a> they are going to train their model in (e.g., TFRecord for TensorFlow, NPY for PyTorch). Data warehouses and SQL currently lack this capability to create train/test datasets in ML file formats.</p><figure id="w-node-3cbc549719ba-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f7ef334aaaf9d602868fc36_table_comparison_04.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Feature Data should be Validated <br>before Ingestion</h2><p>The table also shows the differences in the types of data stored, as well as how the data is stored, validated, and queried. A data warehouse stores data in tables along with schemas for describing the type of data and constraints for columns. Similarly, the feature store stores typed data (typically in tables), but as features are typically stored as ready-to-consume numerical values or vectors (embeddings) or tensors, there is less need for a richer set of column types compared to a data warehouse.&nbsp; Foreign key constraints are typically not supported in feature stores, due to the difficulty in enforcing such constraints between online and offline stores.</p><p>As model training is very sensitive to bad data (null values, outliers cause numerical instability, missing values), feature data should be validated before ingestion. Data validation frameworks, such as <a href="#">Great Expectations</a> and <a href="#">Deequ</a>, have appeared to help implement feature pipelines that apply predicates (data validation rules) on all the features ingested into the feature store, ensuring high data quality in the feature store.&nbsp;</p><p>Domain specific languages (DSL) are sometimes used to define the feature transformations, aggregations, and data validation rules in feature pipelines, but general purpose languages (Python, Scala) are commonly used when non-trivial feature engineering is required.&nbsp;</p><h2>Using the feature store to create train/test data</h2><p>Data scientists are one of the main users of the feature store. They use a feature repository to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) - searching/browsing for available features and inspecting feature values/schemas/statistics. Data Scientists mainly use Python to select features to create train/test datasets. This typically involves joining features together to create a&nbsp; train/test dataset in their file format of choice (.tfrecord, .csv, .npy, .petastorm, etc). Sometimes feature stores support a DSL (domain specific language) to create train/test datasets or other languages such as Scala/Java.&nbsp;</p><h2>Online feature store</h2><p>Online applications use the online feature store to retrieve feature values with low latency to build feature vectors that are sent to models for predictions. In contrast to higher latency data warehouses, feature stores may be required to return feature vectors in single millisecond latency - only really achievable in row-oriented or key-value stores.&nbsp;</p><p>The typical access pattern for retrieving features is a key-value lookup, but if features are to be reused in the online feature store, then joins are again required (either in the database or in the application). In some databases (such as <a href="#">MySQL Cluster</a>), a small number of joins can be performed at very low latency.<br></p><h2>Feature statistics to monitor for feature <br>drift and data drift</h2><p>Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) for features are also useful when identifying data drift in online models. Your monitoring infrastructure can calculate statistics on live prediction traffic, and compare those statistics with the values in the feature store to <a href="#">identify data drift</a> for the live traffic, potentially required retraining of the model.</p><h2>Time-Travel&nbsp;</h2><p>Temporal databases support <em>time-travel</em>: the ability to query data as it was at a given point-in-time or data changes in a given time-interval. The “AS OF SYSTEM TIME” syntax was introduced to <a href="#">SQL 2011</a> to standardize point-in-time queries, while the “VERSIONS BETWEEN SYSTEM TIME ... AND ... “ syntax was introduced to identify the versioned changes to data in a time interval. Time-travel is supported in some data warehouses, but does not have universal support across all vendors.</p><p>For a feature store time-travel has several important uses: when creating train/test data (e.g., training data is data from the years 2010-2018, while test data is data from the range 2019-2020). Time-travel is also useful to make changes to a dataset (e.g., rollback a bad commit of data to the dataset) or to compare metadata (statistics) for features and how they change over time. We rarely require time-travel for features used in serving. Time-travel is also important when performing point-in-time joins, where we ensure that there is no data leakage from the future when we create train/test datasets from historical data.</p><h2>Feature Pipelines&nbsp;</h2><p>Data warehouses typically have timed triggers for running ETL jobs (or data pipelines) to ingest the latest data from operational databases, message queues, and data lakes. Similarly, feature pipelines can timed triggers to transform and aggregate the latest data from different sources before storing it in both the online and offline feature store for scoring by online and offline applications. However, additional pipelines can also feed features to the feature store.&nbsp;</p><p>Predictions made by models can be stored in the feature store along with the outcomes for those predictions. There can be long lags of even days or months or years before outcomes become available - e.g., a prediction on whether a loan will be repaid or not), but as they arrive new training data becomes available that can be used to trigger re-training of models.</p><figure id="w-node-74c5777df82a-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f7ef3219e6baa58c301c833_table_comparison_03.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Data …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will focus on discussing why the ancient text editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)">'ed'</a> works the way it does.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having its roots in the late 1960s, the 'ed' editor is still installed by default on most modern Linux distributions. &nbsp;Although there are few practical use cases for this editor today, it can still be meaningful to learn how 'ed' works since other Unix tools like vim, grep or sed have features that are significantly influenced from 'ed'.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try running the 'ed' command with or without a file argument, you'll see something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim_prompt-wait_811x349_q92.png" width="811" height="349"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're waiting for something to happen then you'll be waiting a long time. &nbsp;That's because 'ed' is waiting for you to do something! &nbsp;The 'ed' program doesn't work like other command-line text editors such as vim or nano. &nbsp;The luxury of being able to print the contents of the current file to the terminal is something that 'ed' takes very seriously. &nbsp;That's why you need to explicitly give 'ed' a command to tell it to do so!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you want to print out an individual line in the file, you can just type the line number and press enter. &nbsp;If you want to append text, use the single-letter command 'a' on a line by itself to enter 'append' mode. &nbsp;Once you're done adding text, write a '.' character on a line by itself and press enter to stop adding text to the file. &nbsp;To review all the lines in the file, you can use the command '1,$p'. &nbsp;Finally, once you're done editing the file, you can use 'wq' to exit:</p>

<p><code><pre>1
Hello World.
a
Here is some more text.
.
1,$p
Hello World.
Here is some more text.
wq
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sense of why this editor is so hard to use, it make sense to think about the way in which people interacted with computers in the early days of computing. &nbsp;Around the time when 'ed' was created, it was still common for computers to print their output on <em>paper</em> instead of electronic screens! &nbsp;These early output devices were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter">'teleprinters'</a>, often abbreviated as TTY. &nbsp;The term TTY is still used on most *nix systems to this day, and if you run this command, you can probably see some of the virtual TTY devices on your system:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>ls</span> /dev/tty*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient model of sending an infinite stream of characters (sent serially) to a 'terminal' or 'teleprinter' device that 'prints' or 'renders' them is still used today. &nbsp;It is even used by more modern terminal programs like vim or nano! &nbsp;You might not believe that vim works this way because it displays all kinds of information at the top and bottom of the terminal. &nbsp;Vim also lets you scroll up and down or open up screen splits etc. &nbsp;You can't possibly send the output of vim to a printer, right? &nbsp;Yes, you can and that's exactly what we're about to try.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'script' command lets you capture all output during a terminal session and save it to a file. &nbsp;This is a great way to log the output when you're running through a sequences of commands that you need to keep track of, but you can also use it to capture everything that gets output to the terminal during a vim session:</p>

<p><code><pre>script
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running the 'script' command try opening a vim session. &nbsp;After doing a few things in vim, quit and then run the 'exit' command in the shell to exit the 'script' session to finish logging:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>exit</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the output from the terminal session is now saved in a file called 'typescript'. &nbsp;Here's an image of what some of the output in the script looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim_vim-script-output_718x292_q92.png" width="718" height="292"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these seemingly gibberish symbols are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI Escape codes</a>. &nbsp;These are the secret to how vim (and all other terminal applications) can use a serial output to print all sorts of interesting user interfaces. &nbsp;Most importantly, some of these escape sequences allow you to move the printing cursor around to arbitrary positions. &nbsp;That's how vim can keep some text pinned at the bottom or top of the terminal while also giving the illusion that you're scrolling 'up' or 'down' in the file. &nbsp;Some escape codes also control the foreground and background colours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, these escape codes were not actually processed by the CPU. &nbsp;The were instead interpreted by the 'terminal' monitor device itself. &nbsp;In other words, the oldest 'terminals' can be thought of as physically separate devices that received a serial stream of text, cursor movement instructions, and color changing instructions.  &nbsp;On a 'modern' computer, every 'terminal' window that you open is basically a software emulation of an ancient physical device that you can imagine to look like a small and bulky CRT monitor. &nbsp;Today, these escape codes are processed by the CPU of your laptop or desktop computer inside these software emulated 'terminals' in your graphical desktop environment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what's stopping us from trying to render the output of vim on a piece of paper to pretend that we're in the year 1969? &nbsp;Nothing! &nbsp;Here's is what the output of vim looks like when I try to render it using my laser printer:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim_vim-page_1920x1080_q30.jpeg" width="1920" height="1080"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that this output doesn't look very useful is because my printer isn't expecting to be used as a display terminal for vim. &nbsp;It doesn't know how to deal with all the ANSI escape sequences and we end up with this weird looking mess.  &nbsp;Do you see the '?2004h' part near the start of the output? &nbsp;You can look that up and see that it's an ANSI escape sequence to 'Turn on bracketed paste mode'. &nbsp;It is an exercise left to the reader to look up the rest of the ANSI escape sequences shown on the page above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, my printer seemed to choke when I printed this and got stuck saying 'data remaining' until I printed a blank test page.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim_printer-stuck_1920x894_q50.jpeg" width="1920" height="894"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't bother investigating, but I assume one of the control sequences confused the printer and made it think it was still waiting on data from the computer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is what using ed would look like if you were only able to render its output on a piece of paper:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim_ed-page_1920x1080_q30.jpeg" width="1920" height="1080"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 'ed' doesn't print any ANSI escape sequences, my printer prints this with no problems!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the two experiences described above, which editor do you think you'd prefer if you had to print all the output on paper?</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you decide to try and learn 'ed', you'll find that the man pages and the '-h' flag are not very helpful. &nbsp;Instead, you should check out the 'info' pages since that's where you'll find out all the details of different editor modes and single-letter commands are:</p>

<p><code><pre>info ed
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you play around with 'ed' for a while, you'll realize that it acts almost like a command-line shell in itself. &nbsp;The only difference is that the environment in which you're working is a file instead of the user space of your operating system. &nbsp;Every little i/o operation on the file is implemented as a command that requires as little information as possible. &nbsp;This makes complete sense when you have to print everything to paper!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine working on a file with modern Vim where your output always goes to a printer. &nbsp;You now decide to open a log file to check what's on the last line and immediately, your printer starts churning a full page of material. &nbsp;Oops, you opened the wrong file. &nbsp;Try another file, and again, oops! &nbsp;Wrong file again! &nbsp;That's a lot of wasted paper. &nbsp;What is it with these millennials and their fancy text editors that just print every line automatically! &nbsp;I remember the good old days when the users had control over their systems, and programs wouldn't just do whatever they want without asking!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the reason why the 'ed' command works the way it does was due to the higher resources constraints that existed at the time. &nbsp;Features like electronic display terminals and ANSI escape sequences were not in common enough use at the time when 'ed' was created, so there was no reason to consider using them. &nbsp;Instead, a shell-like command-line interface for editing files made way more sense.</p>

And since COVID-19, it's gotten worse.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Last year, Canada announced it was working on a ban of single-use plastics, which was initally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/single-use-plastics-covid-1.5683617">sidelined by the pandemic</a>. Recently, the government announced that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/single-use-plastics-1.5753327">many single-use plastics will be banned</a> by the end of 2021. At the same time, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/single-use-plastics-covid-1.5683617">CBC News reports</a> our single-use plastic use increased by 250 to 300 per cent as people tossed their personal protective equipment and stopped using reusable bags and containers over fears they would spread the virus.</p>  <p>What makes our lives convenient is also burying us. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><strong><em>Plastic Wars</em></strong></a>, presented by <em>The Passionate Eye</em>, looks at the mounting crisis and how the industry has spent millions promoting recycling — just to sell more plastic.</p>  <h2>Less than 10% of the plastics we've used have been recycled</h2>  <p>Although activists sounded the alarm about plastic waste in the 1970s, the documentary claims from 1990 to 2010, plastic production more than doubled. We've been sorting our trash for decades, believing it would be recycled. But the truth is the vast majority of the plastic we use won't be. Over the last seven decades, <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/waste/policy-highlights-improving-plastics-management.pdf">less than 10 per cent of plastic waste has been recycled</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That's because, says David Allaway, from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the conversation has been almost exclusively about recycling and not reducing and reusing.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Plastic Wars: Recycling"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1002/935/PlasticWars_Recycling_2500kbps_620x350_1755680835594.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Even as the plastic crisis worsens, the demand for plastic grows and plastic production is rapidly expanding. One issue? Only focusing on recycling, and not reducing the amount of plastic that we use.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:06</span></span></span></p>  <h2>Recycling logo was used as a green marketing tool, says industry expert</h2>  <p>In the '80s, the industry was at the centre of an environmental backlash. Fearing an outright ban on plastics, manufacturers looked for ways to get ahead of the problem. They looked at recycling as a way to improve the image of their product and started labeling plastics with the now ubiquitous chasing-arrows symbol with a number inside.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to Ronald Liesemer, an industry veteran who was tasked with overseeing the new initiative, "Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Most consumers might have assumed the symbol meant the product was recyclable. But according to experts in the film, there was no economically viable way to recycle most plastics, and they have ultimately ended up in a landfill. This included plastic films, bags and the wrapping around packaged goods, as well as containers like margarine tubs.<br> "Our own customers … they would flat out say, 'It says it's recyclable right on it,'" says Coy Smith, former board member of the National Recycling Coalition. "And I'd be like, 'I can tell you, I can't give this away. There's no one that would even take it if I paid them to take it.'" He believes manufacturers used the symbol as a green marketing tool.</p>  <p>"If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they're not going to be as concerned about the environment," says Larry Thomas, another top industry official interviewed in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a>.</p>  <p>According to Lewis Freeman, a former vice-president with the Society of the Plastics Industry, many in the industry had doubts about recycling from the start. "There was never an enthusiastic belief that recycling was ultimately going to work in a significant way," he says.</p>  <p>Yet the plastic industry spent millions on ads selling plastics and recycling to consumers.</p>  <h2>Lots of our plastic was shipped to China, then Southeast Asia, for 'recycling'</h2>  <p>To solve the plastic waste problem, many recyclers started selling their product to China in the 1990s. According to recycling broker Sunil Bagaria, China took waste that North American recyclers couldn't use. "As long as it remotely resembled plastic, they wanted it," he says.</p>  <p>But they used the good stuff and disposed of the rest. And because of a growing plastic waste problem in that country, China finally stopped taking most imported plastic waste in 2018.</p>  <p>"We never asked the question, 'Are they doing it the right way? Are we damaging the environment more in the name of recycling?'" says Bagaria.</p>  <p>Now, Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia have picked up the plastic waste market. And although some North American plastics recyclers are following up to ensure their products are in fact being recycled, plastic waste is now a growing problem there, too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a>, local activist Yuyan Ismawati visits a rural community where locals scour through a huge field of plastic waste for items of value and burn the rest. This creates health problems for the residents in addition to destroying the surrounding environment. "We are struggling to clean up the modern debris and modern litter in Indonesia, the additional burden of waste from overseas — I don't know how we are going to handle it," says Ismawati. "Americans need to know that your waste ended up here."</p>  <h2>Production of plastics expected to triple by 2050</h2>  <p>In 2020, roughly 60 years after concerns about plastic waste were first raised, the focus is still on the consumer to recycle, says Allaway, and not on the environmental impact of the product and overproduction by the industry.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Plastic Wars: Full Impact"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1004/887/PlasticWars_FullImpact_2500kbps_620x350_1755684419745.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Consumers are constantly told that they should do their part to reduce plastic waste, but in reality, consumers have the lowest amount of leverage in reducing waste - it's plastic producers that should be reporting their full environmental impacts.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:56</span></span></span></p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a> the problem is only going to get worse. By 2050, it's estimated the global production of plastic will triple. As the oil and gas industry — which provides the source materials for plastics — &nbsp;faces a future of declining demand for fuel, it has turned to other markets.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The stakes are high, says Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. "This is their lifeline," she says. "They are going to double down on single-use plastic like we have never seen. So we're heading towards a real battle.... This is the big war."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a> on <em>The Passionate Eye</em>.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
