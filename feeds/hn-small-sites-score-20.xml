    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2020</time>
    </p>
    

<p>I quit my job in January 2020 to build a privacy friendly photo organizer.</p>

<p>As a 30 year old whose friends are either getting married or planning
off-springs, what I had underestimated was the difficulty involved in finding a co-founder and how that would compound the difficulty involved in
finding an investor.</p>

<p>Once I accepted the loneliness and the lack of a financial cushion I had to figure out a way to keep building without burning myself out.</p>

<p>It took me a while, but I have found a rhythm that works, and with it, a steady
source of endorphins. Here are some changes that helped me to keep things
moving.</p>

<h2 id="being-patient">Being patient</h2>

<p>Life is no longer as comfortable as it used to be and things are not always
going the way I want them to. Preseverance has been key and indirectly patience
too. Naval’s <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289" target="_blank">take on
meditation</a> (60 minutes x
60 days), was an eye opener. I’ve stuck with it since, and I now have an easier
time identifying negative thought patterns and sitting out situations that would
otherwise overwhelm me.</p>

<p>On some level, spending the last few months locked indoors with my parents, who
are not the most rational people in the world has also helped. But I wouldn’t
recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-procrastination">Reducing procrastination</h2>

<p>Over time I’ve realized that action precedes motivation and procrastination precedes guilt.</p>

<p>Breaking down tasks into chunks that seem trivial to accomplish has helped reduce the friction in getting started on unexciting grunt work.</p>

<p>Then there are tasks which I loathe from my core, like writing out applications
to VCs explaining why what I’m doing will matter. To those I attach reinforcing
personal reasons, like, “I need the $50k to hire that college junior who I love
working with, and that will give me spare bandwidth to focus on traction channels”.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-clearer">Thinking clearer</h2>

<p>It is sub-optimal to not have a coworker to bounce ideas off and rant about problems to. A lot of times it’s these conversations that help you gain clarity.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury I do not have so every time I feel stuck, I type/scribble my thoughts out, and then question everything that was written, and then document my realizations.</p>

<p>Task tracking has also helped in clearing the path. I write down unstructured
thoughts into a diary, and once I’ve clarity, I promote them to a Notion board
(that’s divided into <em>Thinking</em>, <em>Building</em>, <em>Reading</em>, <em>Writing</em> and
<em>Adulting</em>) and every Monday within an Excel sheet I track what was done, and
what is left to be done.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-distractions">Reducing distractions</h2>

<p>I’ve reduced my information consumption to free up brain cycles. I’ve disabled all notifications on my phone barring a few contacts, and I’ve more or less stopped browsing on it. As an added bonus, this has reduced the negativity with which I perceived the world.</p>

<p>To minimize the overhead of context switches, I split tasks into a tree of checkpoints. Before taking a break I note down the next simplest checkpoint so that when I get back to work there’s little friction to resume.</p>

<p>To help me zone out I keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A" target="_blank">lofi
beats</a> or
<a href="http://github.audio/" target="_blank">github.audio</a> playing in the background. Listening to the
latter gives me a strange sense of motivation and makes me feel less alone.</p>

<h2 id="staying-grounded">Staying grounded</h2>

<p>I’m lucky to have some friends who call/text every other week. I look at them as my accountability partners and I talk to them about what I’m doing on a high level. While not all of them genuinely care, some do, and these conversations force me to reflect on how well I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley wisdom suggests that if I’m not sleeping I should be
working, failing because of a burn out would be stupid. An advantage of not
having a VC onboard so far has been the freedom to dictate my pace. So I spend
days thinking, reading, fiddling with my violin or just doing nothing when I
feel like writing code is not what I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s been 7 months of building alone, and while this is not how I pictured things to be on my last day at work, this is the happiest I have ever been. There’s a long way to go, and the grind seems inviting.</p>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, for I’m still learning. If you’ve

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are in a hurry to update U-Boot and the SPL on your PinePhone, then please proceed directly to <a href="#write-u-boot-plus-spl-to-bootable-storage">Write U-Boot+SPL to bootable storage</a>.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to explain what U-Boot, SoC and the SPL are. After that, I will describe the sunxi bootable storage layout as well as the PinePhone boot procedure, so you will understand what you will be updating and why. Then, I will teach you how to determine if an upgrade is required, and I will explain two different ways of upgrading U-Boot. As a special treat for the curious, I will show you the first steps to reverse engineer the U-Boot+SPL firmware blob. I hope this article peeks your curiosity and encourages you to learn more.</p>

<p>Discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244407">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=11099">Pine64</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-u-boot">What is U-Boot?</h2>

<p>U-Boot, or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das%5FU-Boot">Das U-Boot</a> a.k.a <em>the Universal Boot Loader</em>, is a small program that is loaded into <em>read-only memory</em> (ROM) and is ultimately responsible for loading the Linux kernel. Designed with flexibility in mind, U-Boot now supports <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tree/master/arch">a wide variety of architectures</a> for <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tree/master/board">embedded boards</a>, each of which may support multiple boot methods. This article is only concerned with U-Boot as it is configured for the <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/board/sunxi/README.sunxi64">Allwinner 64-bit boards</a>, specifically the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64">Allwinner A64 SoC</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-soc">What is a SoC?</h2>

<p>No, it does not refer to the stinky fabric covering your feet. <em>SoC</em> stands for <em>System on a Chip</em>. The PinePhone contains the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64">Allwinner A64 SoC</a>, featuring a Quad-Core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM%5FCortex-A53">ARM Cortex-A53 ARMv8-A CPU</a> and an <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/Mali400">ARM Mali400 MP2 GPU</a>. See the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64#Documentation">Allwinner A64 documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-spl">What is the SPL?</h2>

<p>The <em>Secondary Program Loader’s</em> (SPL) primary function is to load U-Boot proper, the <em>flattened device tree</em> (<a href="https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flattened-format.html">FDT</a>) and the <em>Arm Trusted Firmware</em> (<a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/about/">ATF</a>), ultimately passing execution to the ATF. In particular, execution is passed to <em>Trusted Firmware-A</em> (<a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">TF-A</a>), which is <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">the official reference implementation</a> used by SoCs with armv8- cores, such as <a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plat/allwinner.html">Allwinner Armv8-A SoCs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-installs-the-spl">What installs the SPL?</h2>

<p>The SPL is installed via the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package from the <a href="http://postmarketos1.brixit.nl/postmarketos/master/aarch64/">postmarketOS aarch64 APK repository</a>. The package is built from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/">pine64 u-boot fork</a> in which they added a <a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci-pine64.yml">pine64 specific GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration</a>. By listing the contents of the package using the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine%5FLinux%5Fpackage%5Fmanagement#apk%5Finfo">apk info</a> command we can see where the SPL binary is actually installed to the root file system.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~$ apk info -L u-boot-pinephone</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">u-boot-pinephone-2020.04_git20200421-r1 contains:
usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div>
<p>However, this is just a convenient location to deliver the binary. The SPL must be deployed to a specific location on disk so that the BootROM can load it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-bytes">A bit about bytes</h2>

<p>I suspect that not all of those reading this article are familiar with the various standards when it comes to measuring information. Allow me to digress with a brief introduction to these standards with respect to how they both measure and represent a <em>kilobyte</em>. Many of the articles that I have linked herein use the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC%5Fmemory%5Fstandards#Unit%5Fprefixes%5Ffor%5Fsemiconductor%5Fstorage%5Fcapacity">Joint Electron Device Engineering Council</a></em> (JEDEC) memory standards in which the unit for <em>kilobyte</em> is denoted by (<code>KB</code>), in upper case letters and represents <code>1024B</code>. This is not to be confused with the kilobyte from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric%5Fprefix/">International System of Quantities</a></em> (SI) in which <em>kilo</em> is denoted with a lower case <code>k</code>, such that <code>kB</code> means <code>1000B</code>. My preference is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">kibibyte</a> (pron. KI-BEE-BYTE), which was established by the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%5FElectrotechnical%5FCommission">International Electrotechnical commission</a></em> (IEC) and is recognized by all major standards organizations, including those aforementioned.</p>

</table>

<p>The reasoning behind my preference is two fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>The JEDEC <a href="https://www.jedec.org/document%5Fsearch?search%5Fapi%5Fviews%5Ffulltext=JESD100B01">Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits</a> only defines the first three higher order prefixes: <em>kilo</em> (K), <em>mega</em> (M), <em>giga</em> (G), referring to them for common usage. The prefix <em>tera</em> was later added to the JEDEC terms dictionary to reflect <a href="https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/dictionary/terms/mega-m-prefix-units-semiconductor-storage-capacity">common prefix usage for modern semiconductor storage capacity</a>.</li>
<li>IEC prefixes cannot be confused with Metric prefixes.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make matters more confusing, sometimes lowercase <code>k</code> is used to mean 1024, e.g. see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html#OPTIONS">tar(1) OPTIONS</a> sub section <code>Size Suffixes</code> located <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html#RETURN%5FVALUE">above the RETURN VALUE section</a>. Understanding which system of measurement is being used is essential when calculating offsets.</p>

<h2 id="layout-of-sunxi-bootable-storage">Layout of sunxi bootable storage</h2>

<p>The first 40 plus <code>KiB</code> of bootable storage for an Allwinner based board has the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable%5FSD%5Fcard#SD%5FCard%5FLayout">following default layout</a>:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Start</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0KiB</td>
<td>8KiB</td>
<td>Reserved for optional MBR or GPT</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8KiB</td>
<td>32KiB</td>
<td>Initial SPL</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>40KiB</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>U-Boot Proper</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>From the layout, one can conclude that upgrading the SPL and U-Boot for the PinePhone must involve writing the <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code> to bootable storage starting at <code>8192B</code>.</p>

<h2 id="pinephone-boot-procedure">PinePhone boot procedure</h2>

<p>Bootstrapping is complicated by initial memory address space limitations. The <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/BROM#U-Boot%5FSPL%5Flimitations">SPL is limited to 32 KiB</a>, most likely because the BootROM, or BROM, loads the SPL into <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory%5Fmap">SRAM A1</a>, which is a <code>32 KiB</code> subsection. If the SPL is larger than <code>32 KiB</code> the BROM will refuse to load it. After the SPL loads U-Boot proper and passes execution to the ATF, U-Boot proper in turn runs <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/blob/master/device/community/device-pine64-pinephone/uboot-script.cmd">the Pine Phone’s u-boot command script</a>. The command script sets the default bootargs for init and calls the <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/cmd/booti.c">booti command</a>, which boots the Linux Kernel Image from memory given the <em>flattend device tree</em> (<a href="https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flattened-format.html">FDT</a>) and the <em>initial ramdisk</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd</a>), ultimately passing execution to Linux init.</p>

</div>

<p>You might have noticed that <code>/usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code> is much larger than <code>32KiB</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">second-chance:~$ ls -lh /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      486.0K Jun 20 12:41 /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div>
<p>That is because the SPL binary image includes a <em>Flattened uImage Tree</em> (<a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/-/blob/master/doc/uImage.FIT/source%5Ffile%5Fformat.txt">FIT image</a>) named <code>u-boot.itb</code> that contains the rest of the firmware.</p>

<h2 id="determine-which-bootable-storage-device-is-relevant">Determine which bootable storage device is relevant</h2>

<p>Before you can <a href="#how-to-determine-if-u-boot-needs-to-be-upgraded">determine if U-Boot needs to be upgraded</a>, you need to know which storage device your PinePhone is booting from. This can be easily determined by using the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk(8)</a> command to list the running operating system’s current mount points. Below is the output of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk(8)</a> run on my PinePhone booted from an <code>SD</code> card:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~$ lsblk --output NAME,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">NAME         TYPE MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0      disk
├─mmcblk0p1  part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2  part
mmcblk2      disk
├─mmcblk2p1  part
├─mmcblk2p2  part
├─mmcblk2p1  part
└─mmcblk2p2  part
mmcblk2boot0 disk
mmcblk2boot1 disk</code></pre></div>
<p>The disk corresponding to the <code>/boot</code> mountpoint is the name of the block special device that postmarketOS is currently running form. The device path to the relevant boot storage device is therefore <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>. We will be using this device name in the next two sections to determine if an upgrade is needed and again to perform the actual upgrade if warranted. You must be careful to use the device name that is relevant to your own running environment if you are following along.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-determine-if-u-boot-needs-to-be-upgraded">How to determine if U-Boot needs to be upgraded?</h2>

<p>You can determine if an upgrade is necessary simply by comparing the version of U-Boot installed by the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package with the version of U-Boot that is written to <a href="#determine-which-bootable-storage-device-is-relevant">the bootable storage device which is relevant to your running environment</a>.</p>

<p>To see which version of <code>U-Boot</code> was installed by the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package, simply run the <code>apk policy</code> sub command as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~/$ apk policy u-boot-pinephone</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">u-boot-pinephone policy:
  2020.04_git20200421-r1:
    lib/apk/db/installed
    etc/apk/cache
    http://postmarketos1.brixit.nl/postmarketos/master</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>strings</code> command to search the binary’s printable strings for the regex pattern <code>U-Boot [[:digit:]]</code> by piping the output through a <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>grep</code> filter. As a side note, the PinePhone uses busybox, so when you find yourself looking up command line documentation with the intention of running the command from a PinePhone shell, always check the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> man pages first.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~/packages$ strings /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin | grep -E <span>'U-Boot [[:digit:]]'</span></code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">U-Boot 2020.04 (Jun 20 2020 - 12:41:48 +0000)</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to determine the version of U-Boot that is currently written to bootable storage, you can search for the same regex pattern in the printable strings of the boot disk after the first <code>8 KiB</code>. However, since the bootable storage is significantly larger than <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>, it would not be efficient to use the <code>strings</code> command as we did previously. Instead, we will use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>dd</code> command, which will allow us to control where to begin and end the search. Since we can’t easily know the exact offset of the version string, which can very from build to build, my strategy has been to simply skip the first <code>8 KiB</code> and then read the same number of <code>KiB</code> as the size of the currently installed <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>. If my search turns up nothing, then that means that the previously installed version was larger, and I can simply increase the <code>count</code> to some reasonable number of <code>KiB</code> until I find what I am looking for.</p>

<p>First, let’s determine the size of <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">ls -lh /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      543.3K Jul 18  2020 /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div>
<p>The binary installed to disk is about <code>5…</code></p></div></div>

        <p><em>This March, I spent a couple of days traveling through western Iceland.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/iceland.jpg" alt="Iceland, part 1"></p>
<p>While I was there, I thought a lot about tools – mechanical tools, software tools, tools that last, and tools that are fragile. The somber snow-covered scenery made me think about how quickly most of the tools we use today get outdated or replaced, and I thought about the kinds of tools that I’ve been building for myself for the last few years to help organize my life.</p>
<p>I took a walk around <em>Smábátahöfnin í Keflavík</em> (a small marina nearby) that night, unraveled myself into my hotel room, and started writing this post.</p>
<p>I want to share why I build my own tools and how I think we should think about building tools for life. It’s long, so here’s a roadmap. Feel free to jump around.</p>

<p>For the last few years, I’ve been on a journey to replace all of the essential digital tools I use for organizing my life with tools I develop, maintain, and deploy myself.</p>
<p>What started with a single-page notes app I made in high school has grown into a constellation of home-grown productivity tools I now rely on for my day-to-day work and learning. Here’s a sample.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#ligature">Ligature</a>, for long-term notes and tasks, goals, brainstorming, project planning, and other important writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/ligature.jpg" alt="Ligature"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/pico">Pico</a>, for more ephemeral notes and tasks that change on a daily basis. I split up my notes into two apps (Ligature and Pico) because it works better for my workflow. (More on this later.)</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/pico.jpg" alt="Pico"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/mira">Mira</a> for keeping track of people I know, why they’re interesting, and what we’ve talked about.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/mira.png" alt="Mira"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lovecroft">Lovecroft</a> for managing and sending emails to my <a href="https://thesephist.com/#newsletter">mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lovecroft.jpg" alt="Lovecroft"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#noct">Noct</a> for backing up and syncing all my files across computers and the cloud. Noct doesn’t have a graphical UI, just a command-line tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/frieden/">Frieden</a> as a public availability calendar, showing when I’m free or busy.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/frieden.png" alt="Frieden"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/thingboard">Thingboard</a> for more free-form Post-its-on-the-wall style brainstorming.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/thingboard.jpg" alt="Thingboard"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://codeframe.co/">Codeframe</a> for spinning off simple JavaScript experiments like <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/word-experiments/#word-plotter">the word plotter</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these apps do almost everything I need to do on my computer to keep myself organized. I don’t use any third-party notes, task management, or contacts apps, though I used to be a big fan of Simplenote and Todoist. I’ve used Notion, Dropbox Paper, Google Docs, and Airtable, but only for working in teams that centralized on them. These days, besides email and calendar, I live within a system of my own tools, and it works well for me.</p>
<p>I don’t want to imply that my tools are objectively better than the professional tools on the market like Notion and Dropbox. Those latter services have more features, and might even be more reliable today. But I think my tools fit me better for a different reason.</p>

<p>Each person’s mind works a little differently, and each person remembers and processes information a little differently. I think we all work at our best when we work with tools that fit how our minds work.</p>
<p>The Eureka moment that some of us feel when we finally find a notes app or todo system that fits our brains – that epiphany happens when the tools we use mirror the way our minds work, and how we want to move information through our lives. Good tools fit perfectly around our workflows, bad tools don’t.</p>
<p>When we resort to having other people build tools for us, the tools they build might never quite perfectly fit our workflows, because they’re not built for our individual minds. When other people build tools for us to use, they either design tools after their own workflows and mental models, or worse, they design it for a mass market of millions of people who all sort-of-but-not-really work and think in similar ways. The result is that mass-market productivity tools don’t fit the way our individual minds are predisposed to work. Instead, to use these tools, we need to bend our workflows to fit around the tools.</p>
<p>My biggest benefit from writing my own tool set is that <strong>I can build the tools that exactly conform to my workflows, rather than constructing my workflows around the tools available to me.</strong> This means the tools can truly be an extension of the way my brain thinks and organizes information about the world around me. My tools aren’t perfect yet, but as they grow and evolve, they’ll only become better reflections of my personal mental models.</p>
<p>For example, one place where my mind works differently than the tools on the market is the task/notes distinction.</p>
<h3 id="tasks-and-notes-a-false-dichotomy">Tasks and notes, a false dichotomy</h3>
<p>My workflow used to differentiate between tasks and notes. Tasks were action items that I could reference, take action on, and complete, and then erase from my list. Notes were things that were indefinitely relevant. I would take notes and then come back to reference them many times. A note by itself isn’t actionable.</p>
<p>But once I started building my own tools, I realized this distinction isn’t really the way my brain worked. For me, a huge grey area exists between actionable, completable tasks and purely encyclopedic notes. Here are some things that fall in the grey area for me, pulled from my real, actual notes I took this week.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently learned some really useful tips about how to grow leaders within a community from the book <em><a href="https://gettogetherbook.com/">Get Together</a></em>. I definitely want to act on these learnings at some point in the communities I lead, but I don’t want them cluttering up my todo list because they’re not things I can just complete and check off quickly. I also want to remember these tips forever, even after the first time I act on them.</li>
<li>I’ve been brainstorming an idea for a side project related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra">symbolic mathematics</a>. I’ve been writing down my inspirations related to this project. I don’t want to tuck it away in my notes, because this is something I want to build soon, but I also don’t want to shove paragraphs of notes into a todo list item.</li>
<li>I keep a running list of ideas I have for future blog posts, but I don’t really have a “write the next blog post” task item under which I’d normally put these ideas, because I don’t write on schedule – I just write when I can. Where should these ideas go? They’re sort-of notes and sort-of tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that these are either very clearly todo items or very clearly notes, and that’s ok. But I certainly felt differently, and I realized I was only separating things into these two buckets because my tools forced me to. Before I wrote my own tools, I had a todo app (Todoist) and I had a notes app (Simplenote), and there was nothing in between.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered a better mental model for my working style: I ask myself <em>how immediately</em> I need to take action on something.</p>
<p>The way that I see it, everything I learn and jot down is something for me to act on at some point in my life. If I read something that I never thought would influence the way I lived, it wouldn’t have value to me, and I simply wouldn’t write it down. Armed with this insight, these days, I have two different notes apps, and I don’t use a todo list app. These two apps are Ligature and Pico, mentioned above.</p>
<p>One is for notes that are changing often. Day-to-day tasks, things to remember for the next week, even long notes and links related to what I’m working on <em>now</em>. The other app is for notes that grow over time, like notes I take while reading books or watching talks, my annual goals, financial planning, reading list, and project outlines. <strong>My two notes apps mirror the way my brain works best – one is my short-term, working memory, the other is my long-term memory.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had this system for a few months now, and haven’t felt any need for something better. It doesn’t have the crazy features of some notes services on the market today, but it just works the way my brain does.</p>
<p>But what if I need something different later on in life?</p>
<h3 id="tools-that-grow-with-your-workflows">Tools that grow with your workflows</h3>
<p>The other benefit of building homebrew tools is that <strong>tools you build yourself can grow and change as your workflow changes over time</strong>. So if my needs do change over time, my tools can grow to accommodate exactly what I need.</p>
<p>When I first started keeping more organized notes on the interesting people I met, I started with a document in my notes app. Over time, I noticed that these notes followed a pattern: I wrote down their name and primary contact info, how I first met them, what school they went to, and what we talked about the last time we spoke.</p>
<p>So when I built Mira, my own people-manager app, I designed it around that exact workflow I had developed. When I later realized I was also recording people’s Twitter usernames in the description field, I just added a Twitter username field to each contact.</p>
<p>This is typical of the way I <em>discover</em> my workflows. <strong>I start with a minimal, bare-bones solution, and try to pick up on patterns and tricks I create for myself. And then I encode those patterns and tricks into the tools over time.</strong></p>
<p>This way, my tools can grow organically as my workflows evolve. Neither of them gets in the way of each other most of the time, and I think that was hard to appreciate before I started relying wholly on my own tools.</p>

<p>My productivity tools, especially my notes and contacts, are the load-bearing tools of my life. If they break or disappear, it’ll take a long time and a lot of effort for me to rebuild those same workflows and tools, so it’s important that they’re reliable, and that I can depend on them working for me for a long time (measured in years and decades, not quarters).</p>
<p>I’ve written at length about <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ownership/">the importance of ownership</a> before. I want to own the pieces of my life that are most critical, and I want agency over how these tools change over time.</p>
<p>I want these notes and ideas and workflows to stick with me as I grow as a person through the next decades. If I had to …</p></article></div>

      <p><strong>AngelCAD - script based 3D solid modeller</strong></p>

<p>AngelCAD is a powerful open source 3D solid modeller based on the Constructive Solid Geometry (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">CSG</a>) modelling technique, expressed in the <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_script.html">AngelScript</a> language. The software creates 3D models in STL or other file formats.</p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong> - AngelCAD uses <a href="https://github.com/arnholm/xcsg" target="_blank">xcsg</a> for 3d computations. xcsg is based on the <a href="https://github.com/arnholm/carve" target="_blank">carve library</a> by Tobias Sargeant. Also used is <a href="http://angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php">Clipper</a> by Angus Johnson, qhull by C.B. Barber and libtess2 by Mikko Mononen.</p>

<p>The AngelCAD language interpreter - as_csg - is based on the <a href="http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/" target="_blank">AngelScript language</a> by Andreas Jönsson, as_csg extends the language with 3d modelling primitives and operations for constructive solid geometry.</p>

<p>The AngelCAD IDE and Viewer applications use the <a href="https://wxwidgets.org/" target="_blank">wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library</a> to create native GUI for Windows and Linux.</p>

            </section>
            <p>The <a href="https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html">Debian Janitor</a> is an automated
system that commits fixes for (minor) issues in Debian packages that can be
fixed by software. It gradually started proposing merges in early
December. The first set of changes sent out ran <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush">lintian-brush</a> on sid packages maintained in
Git. This post is part of <a href="https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html">a series</a> about the progress of the
Janitor.</p>
<div id="scheduling-lintian-fixes">
<h2>Scheduling Lintian Fixes</h2>
<p>To determine which packages to process, the  <a href="https://janitor.debian.net/">Janitor</a>  looks at the import of  <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a>  output across the archive that is available
in  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a> <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>. It
will prioritize those packages with the most and more severe issues that it has
fixers for.</p>
<p>Once a package is selected, it will clone the packaging repository and run
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/lintian-brush/lintian-brush.1.en.html">lintian-brush</a>
on it.  Lintian-brush provides a framework for applying a set of “fixers” to a
package. It will run each of a set of “fixers” in a pristine version of the
repository, and handles most of the heavy lifting.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-inner-workings-of-a-fixer">
<h2>The Inner Workings of a Fixer</h2>
<p>Each fixer is just an executable which gets run in a clean
checkout of the package, and can make changes there. Most
of the fixers are written in Python or shell, but they
can be in any language.</p>
<p>The contract for fixers is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the fixer exits with non-zero, the changes are reverted and fixer is
considered to have failed</li>
<li>If exits with zero and made changes, then it should write a summary of its
changes to standard out</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fixer is uncertain about the changes it has made, it should report so on
standard output using a pseudo-header.  By default, lintian-brush will discard
any changes with uncertainty but if you are running it locally you can still
apply them by specifying <tt><span>--uncertain</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The summary message on standard out will be used for the commit message and
(possibly) the changelog message, if the package doesn’t use gbp dch.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-fixer">
<h2>Example Fixer</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example. The package priority “extra” is deprecated since
Debian Policy 4.0.1 (released August 2 017) – see
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#priorities">Policy 2.5 "Priorities"</a>.
Instead, most packages should use the “optional” priority.</p>
<p>Lintian will warn when a package uses the deprecated “extra” value for the
“Priority”  - the associated tag is
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/tags/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.html">priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional</a>.
Lintian-brush has a fixer script that can automatically replace “extra” with
“optional”.</p>
<p>On systems that have lintian-brush installed, the source for the fixer lives in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush/-/blob/master/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py">/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py</a>,

August 21, 2020 | https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>We covered a lot of ground in our post about <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/"><em>How Tailscale
Works</em></a>.  However, we glossed over how we can get through NATs
(Network Address Translators) and connect your devices directly to
each other, no matter what’s standing between them. Let’s talk about
that now!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-intro.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a simple problem: establishing a peer-to-peer
connection between two machines. In Tailscale’s case, we want to set
up a WireGuard® tunnel, but that doesn’t really matter. The
techniques we use are widely applicable and the work of many people
over decades. For example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> uses this bag of tricks to
send peer-to-peer audio, video and data between web browsers. VoIP
phones and some video games use similar techniques, though not always
successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll be discussing these techniques generically, using Tailscale and
others for examples where appropriate. Let’s say you’re making your
own protocol and that you want NAT traversal. You need two things.</p>
<p>First, the protocol should be based on UDP. You <em>can</em> do NAT traversal
with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite
complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending
on how deep you want to go. We’re going to focus on UDP for the rest
of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re reaching for TCP because you want a stream-oriented
connection when the NAT traversal is done, consider using QUIC
instead. It builds on top of UDP, so we can focus on UDP for NAT
traversal and still have a nice stream protocol at the end.</p>
<p>Second, you need direct control over the network socket that’s sending
and receiving network packets. As a rule, you can’t take an existing
network library and make it traverse NATs, because you have to send
and receive extra packets that aren’t part of the “main” protocol
you’re trying to speak. Some protocols tightly integrate the NAT
traversal with the rest (e.g. WebRTC). But if you’re building your
own, it’s helpful to think of NAT traversal as a separate entity that
shares a socket with your main protocol. Both run in parallel, one
enabling the other.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-deep-integration.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Direct socket access may be tough depending on your situation. One
workaround is to run a local proxy. Your protocol speaks to this
proxy, and the proxy does both NAT traversal and relaying of your
packets to the peer. This layer of indirection lets you benefit from
NAT traversal without altering your original program.</p>
<p>With prerequisites out of the way, let’s go through NAT traversal from
first principles. Our goal is to get UDP packets flowing
bidirectionally between two devices, so that our other protocol
(WireGuard, QUIC, WebRTC, …) can do something cool. There are two
obstacles to having this Just Work: stateful firewalls and NAT
devices.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-firewalls">Figuring out firewalls</h3>
<p>Stateful firewalls are the simpler of our two problems. In fact, most
NAT devices include a stateful firewall, so we need to solve this
subset before we can tackle NATs.</p>
<p>There are many incarnations to consider. Some you might recognize are
the Windows Defender firewall, Ubuntu’s ufw (using iptables/nftables),
BSD’s pf (also used by macOS) and AWS’s Security Groups. They’re all
very configurable, but the most common configuration allows all
“outbound” connections and blocks all “inbound” connections. There
might be a few handpicked exceptions, such as allowing inbound SSH.</p>
<p>But connections and “direction” are a figment of the protocol
designer’s imagination. On the wire, every connection ends up being
bidirectional; it’s all individual packets flying back and forth. How
does the firewall know what’s inbound and what’s outbound?</p>
<p>That’s where the stateful part comes in. Stateful firewalls remember
what packets they’ve seen in the past and can use that knowledge when
deciding what to do with new packets that show up.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-1a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>For UDP, the rule is very simple: the firewall allows an inbound UDP
packet if it previously saw a matching outbound packet. For example,
if our laptop firewall sees a UDP packet leaving the laptop from
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, it’ll make a note that incoming
packets from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> are also fine. The
trusted side of the world clearly intended to communicate with
<code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, so we should let them talk back.</p>
<p>(As an aside, some <em>very</em> relaxed firewalls might allow traffic from
anywhere back to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> once <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> has communicated
with anyone. Such firewalls make our traversal job easier, but are
increasingly rare.)</p>
<h4 id="firewall-face-off">Firewall face-off</h4>
<p>This rule for UDP traffic is only a minor problem for us, as long as
all the firewalls on the path are “facing” the same way. That’s
usually the case when you’re communicating with a server on the
internet. Our only constraint is that the machine that’s <em>behind</em> the
firewall(s) must be the one initiating all connections. Nothing can
talk to it, unless it talks first.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-2.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>This is fine, but not very interesting: we’ve reinvented client/server
communication, where the server makes itself easily reachable to
clients. In the VPN world, this leads to a hub-and-spoke topology: the
hub has no firewalls blocking access to it and the firewalled spokes
connect to the hub.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-3.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The problems start when two of our “clients” want to talk
directly. Now the firewalls are facing each other. According to the
rule we established above, this means both sides must go first, but
also that neither can go first, because the other side has to go
first!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-4.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>How do we get around this? One way would be to require users to
reconfigure one or both of the firewalls to “open a port” and allow
the other machine’s traffic. This is not very user friendly. It also
doesn’t scale to mesh networks like Tailscale, in which we expect the
peers to be moving around the internet with some regularity. And, of
course, in many cases you don’t have control over the firewalls: you
can’t reconfigure the router in your favorite coffee shop, or at the
airport. (At least, hopefully not!)</p>
<p>We need another option. One that doesn’t involve reconfiguring
firewalls.</p>
<h4 id="finessing-finicky-firewalls">Finessing finicky firewalls</h4>
<p>The trick is to carefully read the rule we established for our
stateful firewalls. For UDP, the rule is: <strong>packets must flow out
before packets can flow back in.</strong></p>
<p>However, nothing says the packets must be <em>related</em> to each other
beyond the IPs and ports lining up correctly. As long as <em>some</em> packet
flowed outwards with the right source and destination, any packet that
<em>looks like</em> a response will be allowed back in, even if the other
side never received your packet!</p>
<p>So, to traverse these multiple stateful firewalls, we need to share
some information to get underway: the peers have to know in advance
the <code>ip:port</code> their counterpart is using. One approach is to
statically configure each peer by hand, but this approach doesn’t
scale very far. To move beyond that, we built a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">coordination
server</a> to keep the <code>ip:port</code> information synchronized in a
flexible, secure manner.</p>
<p>Then, the peers start sending UDP packets to each other. They must
expect some of these packets to get lost, so they can’t carry any
precious information unless you’re prepared to retransmit them. This
is generally true of UDP, but especially true here. We’re <em>going</em> to
lose some packets in this process.</p>
<p>Our laptop and workstation are now listening on fixed ports, so that
they both know exactly what <code>ip:port</code> to talk to. Let’s take a look at
what happens.</p>

<p>The laptop’s first packet, from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, goes
through the Windows Defender firewall and out to the internet. The
corporate firewall on the other end blocks the packet, since it has no
record of <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> ever talking to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>. However,
Windows Defender now remembers that it should expect and allow
responses from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>.</p>

        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5b.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Next, the workstation’s first packet from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> goes through the corporate firewall and across the
internet. When it arrives at the laptop, Windows Defender thinks “ah,
a response to that outbound request I saw”, and lets the packet
through! Additionally, the corporate firewall now remembers that it
should expect responses from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, and
that those packets are also okay.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the receipt of a packet from the workstation, the laptop
sends another packet back. It goes through the Windows Defender
firewall, through the corporate firewall (because it’s a “response” to
a previously sent packet), and arrives at the workstation.</p>

<p>Success! We’ve established two-way communication through a pair of
firewalls that, at first glance, would have prevented it.</p>
<h4 id="creative-connectivity-caveats">Creative connectivity caveats</h4>
<p>It’s not always so easy. We’re relying on some indirect influence over
third-party systems, which requires careful handling. What do we need
to keep in mind when managing firewall-traversing connections?</p>
<p>Both endpoints must attempt communication at roughly the same time, so
that all the intermediate firewalls open up while both peers are still
around. One approach is to have the peers retry continuously, but this
is wasteful. Wouldn’t it be better if both peers knew to start
establishing a connection at the same time?</p>
<p>This may sound a little recursive: to communicate, first you need to
be able to communicate. However, this preexisting “side channel”
doesn’t need to be very fancy: it can have a few seconds of latency,
and only needs to deliver a few thousand bytes in total, so a tiny VM
can easily be a matchmaker for thousands of machines.</p>
<p>In the distant past, I used XMPP chat messages as the side channel,
with great results. As another example, WebRTC requires you to come up
with your own “signalling channel” (a name that reveals WebRTC’s IP
telephony ancestry), and plug it into the WebRTC APIs. In Tailscale,
our coordination server and fleet of DERP (Detour Encrypted Routing
Protocol) servers act as …</p></div></div>

<p>As the fourth and final part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>) of our look at the basic structure of food production in the pre-modern world (particularly farming grain to make bread), this week we’re going to look at how at least some of the delicious food we made in the last post might make its way into the hands of people who are <em>not</em> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">farmers </a>or even<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/"> farm owners</a>.</p>



<p>In the previous three posts, I have mostly just used the magic word ‘markets’ to describe how the food produced in the countryside gets to the cities and people who are not farmers.  As we’ll see in this post, that is a bit of an oversimplifying fib, both in that the phrase ‘markets’ covers a <em>lot </em>of complexity, but also (as we’ll see) some of the major drivers of moving that food from the countryside into towns doesn’t involve money <em>or</em> market interactions.  That said, we’re going to <em>start</em> with market transactions, because while they are actually the minority-type in many of these societies, they are more readily familiar and understandable, I suspect, to modern readers.  Then we’ll move to <em>extraction</em> as the other category.</p>

And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click the button below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts, as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or pop-culture thoughts.</p>






<h2>Point of Sale</h2>



<p>I want to start by leaning on (with small modifications for clarity) Paul Erdkamp’s taxonomy of the various options by which food might get into the stream of commerce.  A small farmer might sell their grain (I) directly to city-dwellers, (II) indirectly, via urban middlemen and grain merchants, either in the market or (III) ‘at the gate’ (meaning selling to merchants who come out to the farm in order to buy; the difference being who transports the food to the city), (IV) to itinerant traders at periodic rural markets or (V) to other local small farmers.  As we’ll see, <em>large </em>landholders have a <em>somewhat</em> larger range of options within this taxonomy, but the fundamentals are the same.</p>



<p>While all of these sale methods certainly happened, in every society I have looked at, Option I – selling directly to city-dwellers – is fairly rare for grains and other bulk agricultural goods.  Market <em>gardeners</em>, selling fruits, vegetables (and sometimes flowers) often do sell this way, maintaining a high-intensity garden near town and a shop or stall in the town market.  Likewise, while Option V – small-scale trade between farmers – absolutely happens, it is typically non-monetary: the banqueting of neighbors discussed in the first post.  Where it is monetary, it is typically quite small scale and very short distance.  By and large, small and mid-sized farmers hadn’t the time, expertise or infrastructure to sell their goods directly.  They needed to be farming, not manning a market stall or trying to figure out how to store their goods close to the point of sale.  And of course large landowners, being rich, aren’t going to stand in the market square either (and in many cases don’t want their obvious representative doing so either,  see below).  So while I and V happen, they’re not too common or too large a portion of total trade and we may lay them aside for this discussion.</p>



<p>That leaves Options II, III and IV, all of which involve selling grain to a middle-man merchant of some sort.  The main difference is the location of sale (in town, at the gate, or at periodic rural markets).  Outside of large cities and major ports, markets were likely to be <em>periodic</em>, occurring only on certain days (typically around once per week).  In Roman Italy, these were the <em>nundinae</em> (‘ninth days,’ although it was an 8-day cycle as the Romans count inclusively); the <em>nundinae</em> were minor festivals, days of rest and merrymaking, but they were also the days when the rural markets would be open – the rest-day from agricultural labor enabled farmers to head into local towns to buy or sell whatever they needed (interestingly, at Rome, the <em>nundinae</em> were <em>dies nefasti</em> – state business couldn’t generally be conducted on them – so poor farmers hoping to use their day off to participate politically were out of luck).  Similar periodic markets are common in the Middle Ages (and even today; most ‘farmer’s markets’ in the United States are periodic, <a href="http://www.carrborofarmersmarket.com/">including my town’s</a>).  The periodic nature of these markets is an adaptation to agricultural rhythms; for a market to function there need to be a lot of people together all at once and the small towns that dotted the countryside simply didn’t have the density to do that all of the time.</p>

Please note: the importance of pottery in modern archaeology has given many students and the general public the idea that the ancients were always shipping pots around for sale, as if there was a vast market in pottery.  <strong>Generally, people were buying what was in the pot, not the pot itself</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as noted, our farmers are unlikely to be selling their grain directly to customers.  Instead, they are likely to be using some sort of middle-man merchant, which brings us to:</p>



<h2>Merchants!</h2>



<p>Merchants are a bit of a break from the people we have so far discussed in that they, by definition, live in the realm of the <em>market</em> (in the economic sense, although often also in a physical sense).  As we’ve seen so much of the world of our farmers and even our millers and bakers was governed by <em>non-market</em> interactions: horizontal and vertical social ties that carried expectations that weren’t quite transactional and certainly not monetized.  By contrast, merchants work with transactions and tend to be the <em>first</em> group in any society to attempt to monetize their operations once money becomes available.  I find students are often quick to feel identity with the merchant class, because these folks are more likely to travel, more likely to use money, more likely to employ or be employed in wage-labor; they feel more like modern people.</p>



<p>It thus tends to come as something of a surprise that with <em>stunning</em> consistency, <strong>the merchant class tended to be at best cordially disliked and at worst <em>despised</em> by the broader community</strong> (although not typically to the point of suffering legal disability, as did some other jobs; see S. Bond, <em>Trade and Taboo: Disreputable Professions in the Roman Mediterranean</em> (2016) for this in Rome).  This often strikes students as strange, both because we tend to think rather better of our own modern merchants but also because the image they have of the merchant class certainly looks elite.</p>

<p>For the farmers who need to sell their crops (for reasons we will get to in a moment) and purchase the things they need that they cannot produce, the merchant feels like an adversary: always pushing his prices to his best advantage.  We expect this, but remember that our pre-modern farmers are just <em>not that exposed to market interactions</em>; most of their relationships are reciprocal, not transactional – the horizontal relationships we discussed before.  The merchant’s ‘money-grubbing’ feels like a betrayal of trust in a society where you banquet your neighbors in the good years so they’ll help you in the bad years.  <strong>The necessary function of a merchant is to transgress the ‘rules’ of village interactions which – and this <em>resounds</em> from the sources – the farmers tend to understand as being ‘cheated.’</strong></p>



<p>At the same time, <strong>while most merchant types are humble, the high-risk and potentially high-reward involved in trade meant that <em>some</em> merchants </strong>(again, a small number) <strong>could become <em>very</em> rich</strong>.  That, as you might imagine, <strong>did not go over well for the traditionally wealthy in these societies</strong>, the large landholders.  Again, the values here often strike modern readers as topsy-turvy compared to our own, but to the elite large landholders (who dominate the literary and political culture of their societies), the <em>morally correct</em> way to earn great wealth is to inherit it (or capture it in war).  The <em>morally correct</em> way to hold that wealth is with large landed estates.  Anything else is <em>morally</em> suspect, and so the idea that a successful merchant could – by a process that again, strikes the large landholder, just like the small farmer, as ‘cheating’ – leap-frog the social pyramid and skip to the top, without putting in the work at either having distinguished wealthy ancestors <em>or</em> tremendous military success was an open insult to elite values.  Often laws were put in place to limit the ability of wealthy non-aristocrats (likely merchants or successful artisans) from displaying their wealth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law">sumptuary laws</a>) so as to keep them from competing with the aristocrats; at Rome, senators were forbidden from owning ships with much the same logic (Roman senators being clever, they still invested in trade through proxies while at the same time disapproving of the activity in public politics).</p>



<p>Such disdain appears, with varying justification, in the sources of every pre-modern agrarian society I’ve studied, to one degree or another.  One commonplace of Greek and Roman thinking – despite these being very active, maritime societies – was that the first production of ships and the first sailing was in some essential way a profanation of the divine realm of the sea, a space humans ought not have ever ventured into – and certainly not for anything as mean as profit (e.g. Euripides, <em>Medea</em> 1-6; Catullus. 64.1-20; Valerius Flaccus, <em>Argonautica</em> 627-632; Seneca, <em>Medea</em> 1-12; 301-379, <em>inter alia</em> – thanks to my old grad school pals <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/world-languages/about-us/hedrick.aspx">Buddy Hedrick</a> and <a href="http://gdrsd.org/gdrhs/faculty/michael-hoffman/">Michael Hoffman </a>for …</p></div></div>
