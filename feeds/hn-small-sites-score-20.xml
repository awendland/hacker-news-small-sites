<p>On a recent project we gained the ability to specify environment variables but not the process that was executed.
We were also unable to control the contents of a file on disk, and bruteforcing process identifiers (PIDs) and file descriptors found no interesting results, eliminating <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/goahead/">remote LD_PRELOAD exploitation</a>.
Fortunately, a scripting language interpreter was executed which enabled us to execute arbitrary commands by specifying particular environment variables.
This blog post discusses how arbitrary commands can be executed by a range of scripting language interpreters when supplied with malicious environment variables.</p>



<p>A quick read of the <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> section of the <code>perlrun(1)</code> man page reveals plenty of environment variables worth investigating.
The <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable allows specifying command-line options, but is restricted to only accepting the options <code>CDIMTUWdmtw</code>.
This unfortunately means that <code>-e</code>, which allows supplying perl code to run, is out.</p>

<p>All is not lost though, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HackerFantastic/exploits/blob/master/cve-2016-1531.sh">exploit</a> for CVE-2016-1531 by <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic">Hacker Fantastic</a>.
The exploit writes a malicious perl module to <code>/tmp/root.pm</code> and supplies the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-Mroot</code> and <code>PERL5LIB=/tmp</code> to achieve arbitrary code execution.
However this was an exploit for a local privilege escalation vulnerability and a generic technique should ideally not require access to the file system. Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty">blasty</a>’s <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-exim.sh">exploit</a> for the same CVE, the exploit did not require creating a file and used the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-d</code> and <code>PERL5DB=system("sh");exit;</code>.
The same environment variables were also used to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1dm8fv/hack_this_website_and_win_bitcoins_the_first/c9tm6j4/">solve a CTF challenge</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>One final nicety of a generic technique would be to use a single environment variable instead of two.
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">@justinsteven</a> found this was possible by leveraging <code>PERL5OPT=-M</code>.
While either <code>-m</code> or <code>-M</code> can be used to load a perl module, the <code>-M</code> option allows adding extra code after the module name.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-0: arbitrary code execution achieved using an environment variable against perl running an empty script (/dev/null)</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>--env</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`)'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl /dev/null
<span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>



<p>Reading the <code>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</code> section of the <code>python(1)</code> man page, <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> initially appears like it may be a piece of a straightforward solution.
It allows specifying a path to a Python script that will be executed prior to displaying the prompt in interactive mode.
The interactive mode requirement didn’t seem like it would be an issue as the <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> environment variable can be used to enter interactive mode, the same as specifying <code>-i</code> on the command line.
However, the documentation for the <code>-i</code> option explains that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> will not be used when python is started with a script to execute.
This means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> and <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> cannot be combined and <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> only has an effect when the python REPL is immediately launched.
This ultimately means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> is not viable as it has no effect when executing a regular Python script.</p>

<p>Other environment variables which looked promising were <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Both of these will let you gain arbitrary code execution but require you to also be able to create directories and files on the filesystem. It may be possible to loosen those requirements through the use of the proc filesystem and/or ZIP files.</p>

<p>The majority of the remaining environment variables are simply checked if they contain a non-empty string, and if so, toggle a generally benign setting. One of the rare exceptions to this is <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code>.</p>

<h2 id="making-progress-with-pythonwarnings">Making progress with PYTHONWARNINGS</h2>
<p>The documentation for <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> states <code>it is equivalent to specifying the -W option</code>. The <code>-W</code> option is used for warning control to specify which warnings and how often they are printed. The full form of argument is <code>action:message:category:module:line</code>. While warning control didn’t seem like a promising lead, that quickly changed after checking the implementation.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-1: Python-3.8.2/Lib/warnings.py</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[...]</span>

<span>[...]</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>The above code shows that as long as our specified category contains a dot, we can trigger the import an arbitrary Python module.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the vast majority of modules from Python’s standard library run very little code when imported. They tend to just define classes to be used later, and even when they provide code to run, the code is typically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">guarded with a check of the <code>__main__</code> variable</a> (to detect if the file has been imported or run directly).</p>

<p>An unexpected exception to this is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">antigravity module</a>. The Python developers included an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/206e3074d34aeb5a4d0c1e24d970b6569f7ad702">2008</a> which can be triggered by running <code>import antigravity</code>. This import will immediately open your browser to the xkcd comic that joked that <code>import antigravity</code> in Python would grant you the ability to fly.</p>

<p>As for how the <code>antigravity</code> module opens your browser, it uses another module from the standard library called <code>webbrowser</code>. This module checks your PATH for a large variety of browsers, including mosaic, opera, skipstone, konqueror, chrome, chromium, firefox, links, elinks and lynx. It also accepts an environment variable <code>BROWSER</code> that lets you specify which process should be executed. It is not possible to supply arguments to the process in the environment variable and the xkcd comic URL is the one hard-coded argument for the command.</p>

<p>The ability to turn this into arbitrary code execution depends on what other executables are available on the system.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-perl-for-arbitrary-code-execution">Leveraging Perl for Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>

<p>One approach is to leverage Perl which is commonly installed on systems and is even available in the standard Python docker image. However, the <code>perl</code> binary cannot itself be used. This is because the first and only argument is the xkcd comic URL. The comic URL argument will cause an error and the process to exit without the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable being used.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-2: PERL5OPT having no effect when a URL is passed to perl</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>-e</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`);exit'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl https://xkcd.com/353/
<span>Can't open perl script "https://xkcd.com/353/": No such file or directory</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>Fortunately, when Perl is available it also common to have the default Perl scripts available, such as perldoc and perlthanks. These scripts will also error and exit with an invalid argument, but the error in this case happens later than the processing of the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable. This means you can leverage the Perl environment variable payload detailed earlier in this blog post.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-3: PERL5OPT working as intended with perldoc and perlthanks</figcaption>

<p>A <a href="https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/securitymb">Michał Bentkowski</a> provided a payload for exploiting Kibana (CVE-2019-7609). A prototype pollution vulnerability was used to set arbitrary environment variables which resulted in arbitrary command execution. Michał’s payload used the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc filesystem</a>, specifically <code>/proc/self/environ</code>.</p>

<p>Although Michał’s technique was creative and worked perfectly for their vulnerability, the technique is not always guaranteed to work and has some constraints that would be nice to remove.</p>

<p>The first constraint is that it using <code>/proc/self/environ</code> is only viable if the contents can be made to be syntactically valid JavaScript. This requires being able to create an environment variable and have it appear first in the contents of <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, or knowing/bruteforcing the environment variable’s name that will appear first and overwriting it’s value.</p>

<p>Another constraint, as the first environment variable’s value finishes with a single line comment (<code>//</code>). Therefore, any newline character in other environment variables will likely cause a syntax error and prevent the payload from executing. The use of multi-line comments (<code>/*</code>) will not fix this issue as they must be closed to be syntactically valid. Therefore, in the rare case that an environment variable contains a newline character, it is required to know/bruteforce the environment variable’s name and overwrite it’s value to a new value that does not contain a newline.</p>

<p>Removing these contraints is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

                        <p>The vast majority of serious malware&nbsp;<a href="https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsource_raid16.pdf">over the past 30 years</a>&nbsp;has been written in Assembly or compiled languages such as C, C++, and Delphi. However, ever-increasing over the past decade, a large amount of malware has been written in interpreted languages, such as Python. The low barrier to entry, ease of use, rapid development process, and massive library collection has made Python attractive for millions of developers- including malware authors. Python has quickly become a standard language in which threat actors create Remote Access Trojans (RATs), information stealers, and vulnerability exploit tools. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-one-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-planet/">Python continues to grow radically in popularity</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/malware-against-the-c-monoculture/">C malware monoculture</a>&nbsp;continues to be challenged, it would seem only certain that Python will be increasingly utilized as malware in cyber attacks.</p>

<p>In comparison to a standard compiled language like C, writing malware in Python comes with a whole host of difficulties. The first being that Python is required to be installed on the operating system in order to interpret and execute Python code. However, as we’ll see in the next section, a Python program can easily be converted into a native executable using a variety of different methods.</p>
<p>Malware written in Python will also have adverse effects on file size, memory footprint, and processing power. Serious malware is often designed to be small, stealthy, have low memory footprint, and use limited processing power. A compiled malware sample written in C might be 200 KB, while a comparable malware sample written in Python might be 20 MB after converted into an executable. Both the CPU &amp; RAM usage will also be significantly higher when using an interpreted language.</p>
<p>However, it’s 2020 and the digital landscape isn’t what it once was. The internet is faster than it’s ever been, our computers have more memory &amp; storage capacity than ever, and CPUs get faster every year. Python is also more ubiquitous than ever, coming pre-installed on macOS and most all Linux distributions by default.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows is still the primary target for most malicious campaigns, and it does not come with Python installed by default. Therefore, for threat actors to distribute their malware effectively they must convert their Python code into an executable format. There are many methods to “compile Python” into a native executable. Let’s take a look at the few most popular methods…</p>
<h3>PyInstaller</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png" alt="" width="500" height="100" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png 500w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>&nbsp;is capable of building Python applications into stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux, macOS and more by “freezing” Python code. It is one of the most popular methods to convert Python code into executable format and has been used widely for both legitimate and malicious purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple “Hello, world!” program in Python and freeze it into a stand-alone executable using PyInstaller:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
...

$ ./dist/hello 
Hello, world!

$ file dist/hello 
dist/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=294d1f19a085a730da19a6c55788ec08c2187039, stripped

$ du -sh dist/hello 
7.0M    dist/hello
</code></pre>
<p>This process created a portable, stand-alone Linux ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) which is the equivalent to an EXE on Windows. Now let’s create and compile a “Hello, world!” program in C on Linux for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
}

$ gcc hello.c -o hello

$ ./hello 
Hello, world!

$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=480c7c75e09c169ab25d1b81bd28f66fde08da7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

$ du -sh hello
20K hello
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how much larger the file size is: 7 MB (Python) vs 20 KB (C)! This demonstrates the major drawback we discussed previously about file size and memory usage. The Python executable is so much larger due to the fact it must bundle the Python interpreter (as a shared object file on Linux) inside the executable itself in order to run.</p>
<h3>py2exe</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">Py2exe</a>&nbsp;is another popular method to convert Python code into Windows EXE (executable) format that can be run natively. Similar to PyInstaller, it bundles the Python interpreter with your Python code to make a portable executable. Py2exe is likely to fall out of style with time as it has not been supported past Python 3.4, this is due to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#cpython-bytecode-changes">the bytecode in CPython being heavily changed in Python 3.6 and beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Py2exe utilizes distutils and requires a small&nbsp;<code>setup.py</code>&nbsp;script to be created to produce an executable. Let’s create an example “Hello, world!” executable using py2exe:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; type hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

&gt; type setup.py
import py2exe
from distutils.core import setup
setup(
    console=['hello.py'],
    options={'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1, 'compressed': True}},
    zipfile=None
)

&gt; python setup.py py2exe
...

&gt; dist\hello.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>hello.exe</code>&nbsp;created by py2exe is similar in size to PyInstaller coming in at 6.83 MB.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png" alt="" width="369" height="508" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png 369w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe-218x300.png 218w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></p>
<h3>Nuitka</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nuitka.png" alt="" width="120" height="24"></p>
<p><a href="https://nuitka.net/">Nuitka</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the most underutilized, and yet more advanced method of compiling Python code to an executable. It translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute code the same as CPython. Nuitka can use a variety of C compilers including gcc, clang, MinGW64, Visual Studio 2019+, and clang-cl to convert your Python code to C.</p>
<p>Let’s create a “Hello, world!” Python program on Linux and compile it using Nuitka:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ nuitka3 hello.py
...

$ ./hello.bin
Hello, world!

$ file hello.bin 
hello.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=eb6a504e8922f8983b23ce6e82c45a907c6ebadf, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

$ du -sh hello.bin
432K    hello.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced a portable binary very simply, and at 432 KB is a fraction of the size of what PyInstaller or py2exe can produce! How is Nuitka able to do this? Let’s take a look at the build folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ cloc hello.build/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C                               11           2263            709           8109
C/C++ Header                     1              1              0              7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUM:                            12           2264            709           8116
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced over 8,000 lines of C code from our 1 line Python program. The way Nuitka works is it actually translates the Python modules into C code and then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in the same way as CPython does.</p>
<p>This is very impressive, and it seems highly likely the Nuitka “Python compiler” will see further adoption as time goes on. As we’ll see later, Nuitka might have a further, built-in advantage in protection against Reverse Engineering (RE). There already exist several tools to easily analyze binaries produced by PyInstaller and py2exe to recover Python source code. However, by Nuitka translating the Python code to C it is much more difficult to reverse engineer.</p>

<p>Python malware can take advantage of a massive ecosystem of open-source Python packages and repositories. Almost anything you could think of, someone has already built it using Python. This is a huge advantage to malware authors as simplistic capabilities can be cherry-picked from the open web and more complex capabilities likely don’t need to be written from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three simple, yet powerful tool examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code Obfuscation</li>
<li>Taking Screenshots</li>
<li>Performing Web Requests</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tool Example 1 – Obfuscation</h3>
<p>Malware authors using Python have many libraries they could use to obfuscate their Python code to make code readability much more difficult, such as:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier">pyminifier</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor">pyarmor</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how&nbsp;<code>pyarmor</code>&nbsp;can obfuscate Python code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py 
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyarmor obfuscate hello.py
...

$ cat dist/hello.py
from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime
pyarmor_runtime()
__pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x50\x59\x41\x52\x4d\x4f\x52\x00\x00\x03\x08\x00\x55\x0d\x0d\x0a\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x40\x00\x00\x00\xd5\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x18\xf4\x63\x79\xf6\xaa\xd7\xbd\xc8\x85\x25\x4e\x4f\xa6\x80\x72\x9f\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xec\x50\x8c\x64\x26\x42\xd6\x01\x10\x54\xca\x9c\xb6\x30\x82\x05\xb8\x63\x3f\xb0\x96\xb1\x97\x0b\xc1\x49\xc9\x47\x86\x55\x61\x93\x75\xa2\xc2\x8c\xb7\x13\x87\xff\x31\x46\xa5\x29\x41\x9d\xdf\x32\xed\x7a\xb9\xa0\xe1\x9a\x50\x4a\x65\x25\xdb\xbe\x1b\xb6\xcd\xd4\xe7\xc2\x97\x35\xd3\x3e\xd3\xd0\x74\xb8\xd5\xab\x48\xd3\x05\x29\x5e\x31\xcf\x3f\xd3\x51\x78\x13\xbc\xb3\x3e\x63\x62\xca\x05\xfb\xac\xed\xfa\xc1\xe3\xb8\xa2\xaa\xfb\xaa\xbb\xb5\x92\x19\x73\xf0\x78\xe4\x9f\xb0\x1c\x7a\x1c\x0c\x6a\xa7\x8b\x19\x38\x37\x7f\x16\xe8\x61\x41\x68\xef\x6a\x96\x3f\x68\x2b\xb7\xec\x60\x39\x51\xa3\xfc\xbd\x65\xdb\xb8\xff\x39\xfe\xc0\x3d\x16\x51\x7f\xc9\x7f\x8b\xbd\x88\x80\x92\xfe\xe1\x23\x61\xd0\xf1\xd3\xf8\xfa\xce\x86\x92\x6d\x4d\xd7\x69\x50\x8b\xf1\x09\x31\xcc\x19\x15\xef\x37\x12\xd4\xbd\x3d\x0d\x6e\xbb\x28\x3e\xac\xbb\xc4\xdb\x98\xb5\x85\xa6\x19\x11\x74\xe9\xab\xdf', 1)

  <article>
  
  <p>Jul 13, 2020</p>
  <p>As many web platform developer and Firefox users, I believe <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla’s mission</a> is instrumental for a better Internet. In a recent <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/ecosystem-health">Igalia’s chat about the Web Ecosystem Health</a>, participants made the usual observation regarding this important role played by Mozilla on the one hand and the limited development resources and small Firefox’s usage share on the other hand. In this blog post, I’d like to explain an experimental idea we are launching at Igalia to try and make browser development better match the interest of the web developer and user community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">
    <img src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/open-prioritization.png" width="750" height="255" alt="Open Prioritization by Igalia. An experiment in crowd-funding prioritization.">
  </a>
</p>

<h2 id="igalias-contribution-to-browser-repositories">Igalia’s contribution to browser repositories</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the past in this blog, Igalia has contributed to different part of Firefox such as multimedia (e.g. &lt;video&gt; support), layout (e.g. Stylo, WebRender, CSS, MathML), scripts (e.g. BigInt, WebAssembly) or accessibility (e.g. ARIA). But is it enough?</p>

<p>Although commit count is an imperfect metric it is also one of the easiest to obtain. Let’s take a look at how Igalia’s commits repositories of the Chromium (chromium, v8), Mozilla (mozilla-central, servo, servo-web-render) and WebKit projects were distributed last year:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="374" height="305" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/distribution-of-igalia-commits-2019.png" alt="pie chart">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, the distribution of Igalia's contributions to browser repositories in 2019 (~5200 commits). Chromium (~73%), Mozilla (~4%) and WebKit (~23%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, in absolute value Igalia contributed roughly 3/4 to Chromium, 1/4 to WebKit, with a small remaining amount to Mozilla. This is not surprising since Igalia is a consulting company and our work depends on the importance of browsers in the market where Chromium dominates and WebKit is also quite good for iOS devices and embedded systems.</p>

<p>This suggests a different way to measure our contribution by considering, for each project, the percentage relative to the total amount of commits:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="436" height="339" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/igalia-commit-percentage-per-project-2019.png" alt="Bar graph">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, for each project, the percentage of Igalia's commits in 2019 relative to the total amount of the project. From left to right:
  Chromium (~3.96%), Mozilla (~0.43%) and WebKit (~10.92%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the WebKit project, where ~80% of the contributions were made by Apple, Igalia was second with ~10% of the total. In the Chromium project, the huge Google team made more than 90% of the contributions and many more companies are involved, but Igalia was second with about 4% of the total. In the Mozilla project, Mozilla is also doing ~90% of the contributions but Igalia only had ~0.5% of the total. Interestingly, the second contributing organization was… the community of unindentified gmail.com addresses! Of course, this shows the importance of volunteers in the Mozilla project where a great effort is done to encourage participation.</p>

<h2 id="open-prioritization">Open Prioritization</h2>

<p>From the commit count, it’s clear Igalia is not contributing as much to the Mozilla project as to Chromium or WebKit projects. But this is expected and is just reflecting the priority set by large companies. The solid base of Firefox users as well as the large amount of volunteer contributors show that the Mozilla project is nevertheless still attractive for many people. Could we turn this into browser development that is not funded by advertising or selling devices?</p>

<p>Another related question is whether the internet can really be shaped by the global community as defended by the Mozilla’s mission? Is the web doomed to be controlled by big corporations doing technology’s “evangelism” or lobbying at standardization committees? Are there prioritization issues that can be addressed by moving to a more collective decision process?</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.igalia.com/about/">Igalia</a>, we internally try and follow <a href="https://wingolog.org/tags/cooperatives">a more democratic organization</a> and, at our level, intend to make the world a better place. Today, we are launching a new <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">Open Prioritization</a> experiment to verify whether crowdfunding could be a way to influence how browser development is prioritized. Below is a short (5 min) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk">introductory video</a>:</p>

<iframe width="850" height="508" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I strongly recommend you to take a look at the proposed projects and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/#faq">read the FAQ</a> to understand how this is going to work. But remember <em>this is an experiment</em> so we are starting with a few ideas that we selected and tasks that are relatively small. We know there are tons of user reports in bug trackers and suggestions of standards, but we are not going to solve everything in one day !</p>

<p>If the process is successful, we can consider generalizing this approach, but we need to test it first, check what works and what doesn’t, consider whether it is worth pursuing, analyze how it can be improved, etc</p>

<h2 id="two-crowdfunding-tasks-for-firefox">Two Crowdfunding Tasks for Firefox</h2>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As explained in the previous paragraph, we are starting with small tasks. For Firefox, we selected the following ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CSS <code>lab()</code> colors. This is about giving web developers a way to express colors using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB color space</a> which approximates better the human perception. My colleague Brian Kardell wrote a <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Unlocking-Colors.html">blog with more details</a>. Some investigations have been made by <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205675">Apple</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1026287">Google</a>. Let’s see what we can do for Firefox !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SVG path <code>d</code> attribute. This is about expressing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571119">SVG path using the corresponding CSS syntax</a> for example <code>&lt;path style="d: path('M0,0 L10,10,...')"&gt;</code>. This will likely involve a refactoring to use the same parser for both SVG and CSS paths. It’s a small feature but part of a more general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--S_wgAJA">convergence effort between SVG and CSS</a> that Igalia has been involved in.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is this crowd-funded experiment going to work? Can this approach solve the prioritization problems or at least help a bit? How can we improve that idea in the future?…</p>

<p>There are many open questions but we will only be able to answer them if we have enough people participating. I’ll personally pledge for the two Firefox projects and I invite you to at least take a look and decide whether there is something there that is interesting for you. Let’s try and see!</p>

						Introduction</p><p>
						
						
						&nbsp;
						
						I owe my interest in public education to Everett Reimer. Until we first met in Puerto Rico in 1958, I had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people. Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.</p><p>
						
						
						Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos, not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."</p><p>
						
						
						Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.</p><p>
						
						
						On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, I submitted the various parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and Jos? Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner, Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have appeared in The New York Review of Books.</p><p>
						
						
						Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp; Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.</p><p>
						
						
						I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries. </p><p>

						&nbsp;
						
						
						Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value. Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.</p><p>
						
						
						In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.</p><p>
						
						
						I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the nature of modern institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so, I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life, politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.</p><p>
						
						
						I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent chapters.</p><p>
						
						
						Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil. Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."</p><p>
						
						
						Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be born and to die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken care of by the institutional church. Now to begin andend life at home become signs either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the institutional management of doctors and undertakers.</p><p>
						
						
						Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.</p><p>
						
						
						The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<center><em>TypeScript — ARM  — August 2020</em></center>

<p><big><em>So, you’ve been trying to learn how compilers and programming languages work?</em> </big></p>

<p>Perhaps, you’ve learned about compiling to JavaScript,
or about building an interpreter? Or, maybe, about
compiling to bytecode? All good steps.</p>

<p><em>But there’s a tension building up.</em></p>

<p>Because it feels a bit like cheating.
Because you know that somewhere, somehow, the code you write
is translated to assembly instructions. To the machine language.
That’s where the rubber hits the road. That’s where it gets hot.
And, oh-so-many resources are hesitant to cover this part.
But not this book.</p>

<p>This ebook will show you in detail
how you can build a compiler from scratch
that goes all the way from <em>source</em> to <em>assembly</em>.</p>

<p>The example code is written in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, a dialect of <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
The book describes the design and implementation of a compiler that emits
32-bit <strong>ARM</strong> assembly instructions.</p>

<h2>Why ARM?</h2>

<p>In many ways, the ARM instruction set is what makes this book possible.</p>

<p>Compared to Intel x86-64, the ARM instruction set is a work of art.</p>

<p>Intel x86-64 is the result of evolution from an 8-bit processor,
to a 16-bit one, then to a 32-bit one, and finally to a 64-bit one.
At each step of the evolution, it accumulated complexity and cruft.
At each step, it tried to satisfy conflicting requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel x86-64 is based on <em>Complex Instruction Set Architecture</em> (CISC),
which was initially optimized for writing assembly by hand.</li>
<li>ARM, on the other hand, is based on <em>Reduced Instruction Set Architecture</em> (RISC),
which is optimized for writing compilers.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Guess which one is an easier target for a compiler?</em></p>

<p>If this book targeted Intel x86-64 instead of ARM, it would have been two times as long
and — more likely — never written.
Also, with 160 <em>billion</em> devices shipped, we better get used to the fact
that ARM is the dominant instruction set architecture today.</p>

<p>In other words… ARM is a good start.
After learning it, you will be better equipped
for moving to x86-64 or the new ARM64.</p>

<p><em>Will you be able to run the code your compiler produces?</em></p>

<p>I bet you will! The Appendix will contain a bazillion ways
to execute ARM code, starting from Raspberry Pi,
cloud VM, to various ways to emulate ARM on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>

<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

<p>First of all, you will be able to follow this book in any reasonable programming language.
For me, it was tough to pick one for this job, and I’m pleased I’ve chosen TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is probably nobody’s favorite, but it’s a good compromise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you coming from a dynamic language like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby?
Then if you close your eyes at the
type annotations, TypeScript is just modern-day JavaScript.</li>
<li>If you’re coming from Java or C#, then you will feel right at home,
since TypeScript
is brought to you by the same people who brought you C# <em>(and Turbo Pascal!)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if you’ve never seen TypeScript code before.
If you can read the following, you will most likely be able to pick it up,
as the book goes <em>(real code from the book here!)</em>:</p>

<pre><b>class </b>Label {
  <b>static </b>counter = 0;
  value: number; <em>// Type annotation
</em>
  <b>constructor</b>() {
    <b>this</b>.value = Label.counter++;
  }

  toString() {
    <b>return </b>'.L' + <b>this</b>.value;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I avoided using any TypeScript- or JavaScript-specific
language features in the code.</p>

<p>If you’re into statically-typed functional programming
languages (Haskell, OCaml, or Reason ML),
you will find that the class structure I used
has a nice translation to an algebraic data type.
It is, in fact, how I wrote it first.</p>



<h2>Book Contents</h2>

<p>The book consists of two parts. Part I
presents a <em>detailed</em>, <em>step-by-step</em> guide on how
to develop a small “baseline” compiler that can compile simple
programs to ARM assembly.</p>

<p>By the end of Part I, you will have a working compiler that can
compile simple functions like this one:</p>

<!--table>
<tr>
<td>


md5-73395652867122248e3299aa94c98c61


</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table-->

<pre><b>function </b>factorial(n) {
  <b>if </b>(n == 0) {
    <b>return </b>1;
  } <b>else </b>{
    <b>return </b>n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Into ARM assembly code like this:</p>

<pre>.global factorial
factorial:
  <b>push </b>{fp, lr}
  <b>mov </b>fp, sp
  <b>push </b>{r0, r1}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =0
  <b>push </b>{r0, ip}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>pop </b>{r1, ip}
  <b>cmp </b>r0, r1
  <b>moveq </b>r0, #1
  <b>movne </b>r0, #0
  <b>cmp </b>r0, #0
  <b>beq </b>.L1
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>b </b>.L2
.L1:
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>sub </b>r0, r0, r1
  <b>bl </b>factorial
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>mul </b>r0, r0, r1
.L2:
  <b>mov </b>sp, fp
  <b>pop </b>{fp, pc}
</pre>

<p>This code won’t win any awards, and an optimizing compiler
could do much better, but it’s a start!</p>

<p>Part II talks about <em>more advanced</em> topics in <em>less details</em>.
It explores several different (often mutually exclusive)
directions in which you can take your compiler.</p>

When I write blog posts I usually spent the first half
of the time writing the code and develoing the idea, and
the second half on the prose.
This book will be no exception.

At the moment I have finished writing
the code, and I am very happy with the results.
I expect the book to be ready early summer 2020, and a draft to
be available even sooner.

Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - George Bernard Shaw</blockquote><p>I grew up in a family where I was taught to be likable. To please, to impress, and to make others happy. Seems like a pretty good idea, right?</p><p>While likeability is a good trait if you want to be popular it isn't ideal if you want to achieve. Let me explain.</p><p>Popularity feels good. Being liked feels good. Humans evolved as social creatures and we crave attention from each other. This pattern plays out over and over in schoolyards, bars, and workplaces, or anywhere humans meet. And the cooperation needed for our survival can only happen if you're accepted by your tribe.</p><p>However, praise by the masses won't make you successful, let alone fulfilled. Actually it's more likely that <em>popularity will prevent you from being successful.</em></p><p>Movie stars, professional athletes, and a business visionaries–we all want to be them. We grow up trying to be them. Personally, I've long idolized Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. But most of our heroes got to where they are by being unlikeable, not likable.</p><p>We love these men and women for being unique yet we internally berate ourselves for being different. These heroes have been described as annoying, difficult, stubborn, and unreasonable. Not exactly what we strive to read about ourselves in peer reviews. Sure, they have some popularity, but it's not all rainbows. Was Gandhi liked? Yes, but he also had millions of people who were against him, and ultimately murdered him. So if it's the oddballs that we look up to, why do we try to be so likable?</p><p>This aversion to difference starts early. Bullies throughout life pick on the kid who is different, on the easy target. Additionally modern culture has decided that the best path in life is to do as you're told; follow the rules, stay in line, and smile. Follow the leader and be a good girl/boy. The scripture of conformity is pervasive.</p><p>And there is true merit to fitting in. Society can't exist without collectively agreed upon rules. Early on we learn that being a three year old hellion is unacceptable has consequences. If I spit out my Cheerios one more time mom will be angry mom, so I'm going to be nice.</p><p>So we're taught to fit in. Be likable and hide your "flaws". Like the only white fish in a school of black fish you don't want to be the different one when a shark is on the prowl. Blend in and don't stand out. Seek group acceptance.</p><p>While conformity has its place in keeping society running, too much conformity stunts progress.</p><p>Differences are what make you, you and me, me. They're what make change possible. Change comes from differences, not from more of the same. After all, a species evolves based on small aberrations, on "flaws", that turn into strengths and a better way of being.</p><p>All progress comes from those who see the world differently. First they act differently and then they convince others to see differently as well. They don't accept the status quo and they don't assimilate.</p><p>Generally speaking this results in being unpopular. Many of the people who helped change the world aren't liked even in the height of their success. But they kept pushing their indomitable will against the world, and eventually, the world shifted ever so slightly.</p><p>Practice being unreasonable this week. Don't "yes" your way through life, following someone else's path for you. Be a bit more of a jerk. Be more demanding. Piss a few people off.</p><p>And be okay with it. Be okay with people being angry or mad or annoyed with you. Cultivate your ability to keep pushing towards your goals despite what others say.</p><p>And who knows, maybe you'll see the world shift ever so slightly.</p>

    <p>The human brain is a marvel of biological engineering. It allowed us to accumulate and pass on the knowledge of many prior generations throughout millennia, resulting in a civilization that went into space, taught computers to see and speak, and that continually discovers and investigates the laws of the Universe.</p>
<p>Its complexity is astounding, and we do not fully understand it yet. And because of that, occasionally, myths about the functioning of the brain pop out. Among the most prominent such legends is the one that claims we are dormant geniuses. But before analyzing and debunking that, let’s discuss some brain facts.</p>
<h2 id="size-does-not-matter">Size Does Not Matter</h2>
<p>For instance, did you know that the brain weighs around 1300-1400 grams? It represents only 2% of the total body weight of a 150 pound or 70kg human. However, it requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% of total cardiac output (the blood that flows in our body);</li>
<li>20% of total body oxygen;</li>
<li>25% of total body glucose utilization</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/brain-energy-consumption.png" alt="Human brain weight vs. energy consumption"></p>
<p>That is quite an energy-hungry organ inside our skull! But even that fades away when comparing to children: at around five years old, the human brain takes up as much as 50% of oxygen consumption<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the brain’s level of oxygen consumption does not significantly vary when you are resting vs. when you do some cognitively intense work. Overall, measures of the whole brain changes in blood flow during intense mental activity have failed to demonstrate any change. Even <em>local changes</em> in blood flow of the regions involved most in a cognitive task are often 5% or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, it is well known and demonstrated that glucose is the brain’s “fuel,” therefore increases in blood glucose levels can positively impact cognitive performance in some tasks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-mystical-brain-myth">The Mystical Brain Myth</h2>
<p>There is a popular myth that we use our brains at only 10% of its capacity, thus boldly affirming that we have a whopping 90% of dormant potential that we can awaken and become geniuses.</p>
<p>Unlike other widespread myths that started from a single event, or unscientific claims from poorly designed research studies (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> and his fraudulent study than falsely claimed a link between vaccines and autism), the myth that humans use only 10% of their brains started at the end of the nineteenth century and was gradually strengthened by many people since then. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#Origin">Wikipedia</a> article on the subject has a lengthy explanation of the potential origin and evolution of the myth throughout the years.</p>
<h3 id="a-small-confession">A Small Confession</h3>
<p>Before moving on, I have a revelation to make. Occasionally, I might buy a cloth item and wear it once or twice. If I recall correctly, there might have been one or two items in my experience that I have not worn at all. Do you know anyone with similar oddities?</p>
<p>This makes my wardrobe much like the brain described in the myth: I am using around 10% of it, and I can “tap into” the rest of my wardrobe should such need arise.</p>
<h3 id="your-brain-is-not-a-wardrobe">Your Brain Is Not A Wardrobe</h3>
<p>But our brain is not a collection of cloth items. Though there are still unanswered questions regarding some brain functions, brain mapping physiology demonstrates that all its areas have a purpose. And you do not have to be a neuroscientist to prove that, simply recall from your anatomy classes that the brain has different regions, such as the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and the fact that each of those lobes has its role.</p>
<h2 id="debunking-the-myth">Debunking The Myth</h2>
<p>Let’s address that myth in a more scientific manner.</p>
<p>If we are using only 10% of our brains, that means a person would be fine if the other 90% of the brain got removed. 10% of the 1400g average brain is 140g—that’s the size of a sheep’s brain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Since I doubt sheep have their own 90% hidden potential myth, it makes no sense that humans have advanced so far as a civilization by using only part of their brains equivalent in size to a sheep’s brain.</p>
<p>There are instances in history when people were injured and got parts of their brain removed (although not as close as even 10%), the most prominent (and among the first recorded ones) being the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>, who survived an accident where a large iron rod was driven through his left part of the head, from the bottom of the cheek, through his left eye and frontal lobe all the way to the top of his head. He lived 12 years more after that accident. There are varying opinions on his recovery, but it took him ~10 years to recover from the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Another example is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Zasetsky">Lev Zasetsky</a>. A bullet entered his left parieto-occipital area and resulted in a long coma. Following this, he became unable to perceive the right side of things. Objects he did see often appeared as fragmented pieces rather than whole objects. He did not recover in the 50 years he lived after the injury.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn—The Brain Basics</a>, our brains can rewire through a process called <em>neuroplasticity,</em> which can help regain some of the lost functions as a result of an accident. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Researchers have found that only 27% of people recover from a <em><strong>concussion.</strong></em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> That means almost 3 out of 4 people do not fully recover! And this is “just” a concussion—your brain does not lose any of its parts.</p>
<p>If 90% of the brain were unnecessary, it is highly unlikely that we would not have evolved such big brains with irrelevant matter in the first place. There are several factors for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical risk of childbirth deaths due to the big skull size would stress out the selection of offspring with smaller brain sizes.</li>
<li>Natural selection favors characteristics that offer an advantage of some sort over the other. There is no way such a big brain would have formed in the first place if it wouldn’t be necessary for survival.</li>
<li>As already mentioned, the brain requires an enormous amount of energy. Even if we had 90% of the brain unused and suddenly were to “wake” it, we couldn’t provide our brains with enough power, as it already consumes 20%-25% of the entire body resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this scientific evidence works against this myth. We indeed use only some areas of the brain at any given time, but throughout the day, we use all of it, not just 10%. And next time you hear about this myth, recall the sheep brain weight.</p>

<h4><a href="https://petsymposium.org/2020/files/papers/issue1/popets-2020-0003.pdf"><strong>Discontinued Privacy: Personal Data Leaks in Apple Bluetooth-Low-Energy Continuity Protocols</strong></a></h4>

<p>We found that Apple devices are leaking sensitive information in the BLE wireless signals they emit. Those issues are associated with the Apple Continuity services and are affecting all Apple devices as well as devices compatible with the Continuity framework. Based on a reverse engineering of Continuity, we identified that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) messages emitted by Apple devices include unencrypted data that can expose sensitive information. We discovered that those data can be easily collected by an eavesdropper and processed in order to: track users, monitor activities in a smarthome, obtain phone number, email addresses and Apple Voice Assistant, Siri, commands, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png" alt="" width="822" height="385" srcset="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png 822w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-300x141.png 300w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>

<h2>BLE advertising</h2>
<p>In BLE, devices broadcast short messages, called Advertising Packets, to announce their presence and feature to nearby devices (those messages can be observed from an Android device using an application like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner&amp;hl=en">Ramble</a>). Advertising Packets can include the name of the device, its type, but can also include custom data in a field called Manufacturer specific. This field is typically used by vendors to transmit data for application. Apple make use of this field to include data for its Continuity Protocols.</p>
<h2>Apple Continuity Protocols</h2>
<p>Apple has developed a number of features, called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681"><i>Continuity</i></a>, that are designed to increase the usability of its products. Those features include: activity transfert, file transfert (airDrop), Wi-Fi password sharing, etc. The communication between nearby devices, required by Continuity services, is done by using BLE. Continuity data are embedded in BLE advertising packets and are broadcast to be picked up by nearby devices.</p>

<h2>Data exposed in cleartext</h2>
<p>We found that, even though some elements are encrypted, most of the data included in Continuity messages is sent in plain text. The exposed data can thus be passively collected by an eavesdropper and exploited to mount one of the attack presented below.</p>
<h2>Tracking users (iPhones, iPad, airpods …)</h2>
<p>We found that the content of <i>Apple Continuity </i>BLE messages can be used to track the device despite the use address randomization. We have identified several elements that remain constant over time or that can undermine the anti-tracking feature mechanism (i.e. address randomization). For instance, we found that messages emitted by earpods include information (battery levels and lid open counter) that can be exploited to track the earpod set. We also discovered a novel attack that would allow tracking by actively replaying BLE messages. An passive attacker could exploit this information to track the the location of individuals in spite of address randomization, the anti-tracking feature of BLE.</p>
<h2>Linking device belonging to the same iCloud account</h2>
<p>We discovered that it is possible to link together devices associated to the same iCloud account. This attack relies on the replay of messages that will trigger a response only from devices associated to the same <i>iCloud</i> account. An attacker could exploit this to identify all the device belonging to a person, and could narrow down its home if some device are left there.</p>
<h2>Monitoring activities in a smart home (Homekit)</h2>
<p>We found that messages emitted by <i>Homekit</i>-compatible devices can betray the activity in a smart-home. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"><i>Homekit</i></a> is a smart-home framework developed by <i>Apple</i> and found in <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit">devices</a> of <i>Apple</i> and other vendors (…). <i>Homekit</i> devices using BLE continuously emit messages that include an indicator reflecting the device state. For instance, in the case of a lightbulb, this indicator changes only when it is either turned on or turned off. Similarly, in an infrared movement detector, the indicator changes only when a person crosses the detection field. In-lab experiments showed that a passive attacker can leverage Homekit BLE messages to track the evolution of devices in a household and thus monitor the activities of the occupants.</p>
<h2>Device model, software version and more</h2>
<p>We found that a number of messages expose a wide variety of information on the emitting device characteristics and state: device model, OS version, device color, cellular connectivity, battery level, current activity etc.</p>
<h2>E-mail address and Phone numbers (Airdrop &amp; Nearby)</h2>
<p>We found that when using features such as Airdop and Nearby, devices emit messages from which email addresses and phone numbers can be extracted. Continuity services allow to seamlessly share resources with nearby devices: Airdrop to share files, Nearby to share Wi-Fi network credential. Prior exchange of information, the devices establish their identity by exchange identifiers over BLE: email addresses and/or phone numbers. Those identifiers are not sent in clear but are rather hashed using a cryptographic hash-function. This obfuscation can be bypassed in most cases and the identifiers recovered.</p>
<h2>Voice assistant commands (Siri)</h2>
<p>We found that when activated via voice, the Siri voice assistant will generate a message including a digital fingerprint of the command. Although the raw audio signal cannot be reconstructed from it, the fingerprint could be leveraged to infer the command.</p>

<p>The vulnerabilities identified were reported to Apple, Osram and Eve on May 29 th , 2019.</p>

<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

July 13, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One of the strangest phenomena in academia is the reliance on publishing
companies. In this article, I want to outline some of the issues that
arise when working with publishers. I shall also endeavour to provide
some solutions to improve this collaboration.</p>
<p>Before we start, a brief <strong>disclaimer</strong>: this article will use an
amalgamation of different incidents that involved either myself, my
colleagues, or my friends.  Names&nbsp;(of the publishing companies)
have been withheld because I do not think it fair to use my ‘soapbox’
without giving the <em>other</em> side a chance to respond. Moreover,
everything I write here pertains to publishing your research in
a journal. Conference publishing—at least in machine learning—is
a joy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Plus, there <em>are</em> good examples of journals for machine
learning papers, foremost of them the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of Machine Learning
Research</a>. The ‘adversaries’ in this article are
rather the ‘big’ publishing companies and their practices. With that out
of the way, let us take a look at the state of the art!</p>

<p>If you are new to science, at some point, you will probably have to deal
with an established publishing company to get your article published.
The deal usually works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You look for a journal you want to publish in and submit your article
to the journal. This already often involves jumping through some
hoops. Without knowing the eventual fate of your article, you often
already have to abide by certain arbitrary formatting guidelines or
completely ‘butcher’ your article for the submission<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> by shifting
content around. However, this can be all accepted and endured because
of course, you want something from <em>them</em>, i.e. a published,
citable publication!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journal then receives your submission—often through a web
interface that was developed with all the UX/UI knowledge of the
1980s<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and has <em>never</em> been updated since—and this is where it gets
slightly <em>murky</em>. Another person—typically the editor of the
journal—now decides whether to accept the paper for reviewing, or
whether to provide you with a desk reject. A desk reject usually cannot
be appealed. It just shows you the door and leaves you to try again
with another journal&nbsp;(more murkiness here). For early-career
researchers like Ph.D. students submitting their first paper,
this can be highly discouraging. I see the reason for reducing the
workload on reviewers, of course, but I also heard of academic feuds
that were carried out on the backs of Ph.D. students and their
publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming your paper ‘survived’ the desk reject, it will now be sent
to reviewers or referees. Their job is to review your paper
thoroughly, provide feedback, and in general give this whole business
a formal veneer. Setting aside problems in the reviewing
process—which I discussed <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/reviewing/">in another blog post</a>—this again opens up a portal into
a strange dimension: working as a reviewer for a journal is usually
a job that is provided for free&nbsp;(same goes for editorial
duties). Notice that this is <em>despite</em> the fact that those journals
are charging money to readers and universities. ETH Zurich, my
current employer, describes their experiences of the <a href="https://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Services/Using-ordering-resources/National-negotiations-with-publishers-Read-publish-reorganised">negotiations
with
publishers</a>
and mentions an expenditure of 6.4 million EUR&nbsp;(roughly 7.25
million USD) per year for being allowed to access journal articles.
That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>Setting aside the actual numbers here, let me just point out how
strange it is that companies are relying on <em>unpaid labour</em>, and this
reliance is <em>crucial</em> to their business model. They often do not
employ people that are qualified to judge the content that they want
to publish! But of course, reviewers and editors get the benefit of
<em>exposure</em>—that wonderful currency that is supposed to help your
career along! Even stranger: journals often charge hefty sums for
accessing your own research articles. To me, it is super weird that
research that is often <em>funded</em> by the taxpayer cannot be <em>accessed</em>
by the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supposing your article got sufficiently good reviews to be published,
the next stage of the process starts. This is where the <em>meddling</em>
begins in earnest. After a little back and forth, you article will be
changed according to some arbitrary rules: the last period of every
sentence in an image caption will be removed, footnotes will be put
into the text—because for some reason, footnotes are permitted in
virtually every template and publishing medium, but deemed somewhat
uncouth by certain publishers—and you might have to redo certain
parts of your paper because of subtle font changes or what have you.</p>
<p>Again, lest you think of me as a particularly cranky person prone to
grumbling and finding faults, you are getting the wrong idea here.
I do not object to these changes, but I <em>do</em> object to the fact that
these meddlesome changes often decrease the quality of your paper.
Here are some irksome changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Footnotes will be inserted willy-nilly into the text, regardless of
whether they make sense or not. That might break the flow of your
paper, but that is <em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ‘publisher house rules’ conflict with proper nomenclature in
a field. For example, the journal might have the ‘rule’ that all
fields in a table have to be capitalised. If this clashes with
nomenclature in your field, it is—you guessed it—<em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your equations will typically be typeset yet
another time for you<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which might introduce subtle changes: symbols
will change and you have to be go through your own paper once again
line-by-line to see whether anything untoward happened. Again, I am
primarily objecting to the substandard quality of this meddling:
the work that you put into writing your equations is completely
ignored, and now you have to chase—often very subtle—changes in
your own text. For mathematical typesetting, precision is crucial,
and it is unbecoming when people who do not <em>care</em> about this
precision create more work for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a last example, your figures might be meddled with: you might be
forced to convert them into obsolete file formats&nbsp;(because
apparently, EPS is still the best format available), or, more
appallingly, vector graphics might be converted to raster
images&nbsp;(judging from the experiences of my friends and myself,
this is unfortunately relatively common!). This might sound like a tiny
problem again, but it decreases readability and accessibility for
some readers, and, more to the point of this post, it is somewhat
unnecessary meddling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me re-iterate my main point: I do not object to changing my
paper, I merely object to meddlesome changes that are just generating
useless work. For example, there is no need whatsoever to typeset
your equations again—this is quite literally the definition of
negative work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you survived this ordeal intact, you now must <em>pay</em>. To be fair,
not all journals charge you for normal articles, but <em>most</em> of them
charge you for open access publishing. In other words: if I want my
research, which is generously funded<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by the Swiss taxpayers, to
be available to those selfsame taxpayers, I have to pay. The amounts
vary a little bit, of course, but we are talking upwards of a few
hundred USD at least. Luckily, this is <em>not</em> a problem for my
research group; my postdoctoral adviser, <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Prof. Karsten
Borgwardt</a> ensures that
sufficient funds for open access publications are available.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sometimes the cost is fielded by a conference; this
happens when the conference has a contract that ensures that its
publications will be available as special issue of some journal.
This might seem nice because it <em>shifts</em> the costs away from authors,
but it is also somewhat non-transparent; conference costs being high
already, I find it strange that some of the money goes into the
pockets of another party.</p>
<p>After all this negativity, it is time for a <em>positive example</em>:
NeurIPS, one of the flagship machine learning conferences, is
partnered with a publisher and makes <em>all</em> papers available for free
online. I <em>gladly</em> pay the conference fee for this!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How can this process be improved? I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: publishers should make it clear <em>where</em> the funds are
going. Are we increasing shareholder value by working for free? How
are profits split and used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giving back</strong>: it is generally understood that everyone needs to eat
and no one should have to work for free. Why is then that this
completely different in publishing? Almost all the profits are
essentially generated because editors and reviewers work for free.
I know that being remunerated for your reviewing work might raise
some questions about impartiality etc., so I think <em>paying</em> people to
write reviews might be somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>However, closely related to my point about transparency, publishers
could be more upfront about how they user their funds and <em>give back</em>
to the community. For example, publishers could sponsor students so
that they can visit a conference for free, or publishers could
sponsor the conferences themselves.</p>
<p>If you, as a publisher, engage the community and give back a little,
the community will be all the more happy to work with you. We need
you, but you also need us. Without the scientists, you cannot be
a scientific publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to excellence</strong>: publishers should commit to the highest
quality and the highest standards. Employ people that are capable of
working <em>with</em> the scientists, not <em>for</em> the scientists. Train your
employees to be experts in typography, typesetting, and pair them
with domain experts so that they do not create more work for the
authors by inadvertently destroying equations, figures, and so on.</p>
<p>This goal is not necessarily orthogonal to maximising your profits,
by the way: if you lower your standards, your reputation as
a publisher will suffer, meaning that scientists in the long
run&nbsp;(!) might not be willing to publish with you any more. If
you commit to excellence, by contrast, we will flock to you.</p>
<p>I know that working with a publisher that <em>cares</em> about the end
product as much as I do is a heavenly match! So we should endeavour
to make such …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]

<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p><span>
    Outline has great UI
</span>
<img src="https://www.getoutline.com/images/screenshot.png"></p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>
<img src="http://chsasank.github.io/assets/images/outline/make_install.png"></p>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.
