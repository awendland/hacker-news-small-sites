</p>


<h2><span id="Bill_Gates_is_my_hero">Bill Gates is my hero</span></h2>
<p>Bill Gates was an early guiding light and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">our</a> inspiration. When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Krzysztof_Biedalak" title="Krzysztof Biedalak">Krzysztof Biedalak</a> and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates's software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_saved_over_100_million_children" title="Bill Gates saved over 100 million children">30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill's foundation</a>. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_You_can_improve_education_by_throwing_more_money_in_it" title="Myth: You can improve education by throwing more money in it">investing in education will produce better outcomes</a>? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end" title="Compulsory schooling must end">Compulsory schooling must end</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Grand_Education_Reform" title="Grand Education Reform">Grand Education Reform</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Could_Bill.27s_great_mind_be_wrong.3F">Could Bill's great mind be wrong?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about "the system" only in 2016 when getting ready to write this <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">book</a>. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_perspective">Bill Gates's perspective</span></h2>
<p>Could this just be that Gates's perspective is so much different than mine?
</p><p>He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.
</p><p>He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">standardized testing</a> approach.
</p><p>He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Modern_schooling_is_like_Soviet_economy#Schooling_is_like_Soviet_Economy" title="Modern schooling is like Soviet economy">With an industrial goal in mind?</a>
</p><p>Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?
</p><p>There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.
</p><p>He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.
</p><p>He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.
</p><p>Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds "<i>you can't run a society on top 5%</i>". He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.
</p><p>Gates's approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.
</p><p>My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.
</p><p>His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.  
</p><p>Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.
</p><p>Last but not least, could Gates's approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Thiel_on_competition_for_degrees" title="Thiel on competition for degrees">the opposite of Peter Thiel</a> who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.
</p>
<h2><span id="Bill_Gates.27s_formula_for_success">Bill Gates's formula for success</span></h2>
<p>I see Gates's own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:
</p>
<ul><li> healthy childhood of few concerns (preferably without the relegation to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>)</li>
<li> healthy approach to schooling with pranks, rebellions, disobedience, and freedom </li>
<li> minor trajectory nudges within the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone" title="Push zone">push zone</a> by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</li>
<li> breakthrough passion, e.g. for tinkering with computers or software</li>
<li> healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g. <i>Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world</i>)</li>
<li> relentless lifelong pursuit of goals born from that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">youthful passion</a></li>
<li> voracious reading (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bill_Gates_and_his_non-incremental_reading" title="Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading">Bill Gates and his non-incremental reading</a>)</li></ul>
<p>Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.
</p>

<p>When <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/First_steps_of_SuperMemo" title="First steps of SuperMemo">I got my first computer in 1986</a>, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer's obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">program for planning my day</a> on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disk</a> drive only <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_1.0_for_DOS_(1987)" title="SuperMemo 1.0 for DOS (1987)">in 1987</a></p>
<p>The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill's success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.
</p>
<h2><span id="My_attempt_at_employing_Gates.27s_formula">My attempt at employing Gates's formula</span></h2>

<p>I am happy with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Exponential_adoption_of_spaced_repetition" title="Exponential adoption of spaced repetition">my achievements in life</a>. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Daycare_misery" title="Daycare misery">daycare</a>, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_World" title="SuperMemo World">own business</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Reconciling_Gates_and_Woz">Reconciling Gates and Woz</span></h2>
<p>Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Testing" title="Testing">testing</a>, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning" title="Fundamental law of learning">rebel</a>!
</p><p>Gates believes that the key to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform" title="Reform">great future education system</a> is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn't ever need to write <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_Schooling" title="Problem of Schooling">this book</a>. The problem is that <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Progressive_education" title="Progressive education">a great teacher is simply a truly great man</a>. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands …</p></div></div>

November 27, 2020 | https://htmx.org/posts/2020-11-24-htmx-1.0.0-is-released/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://htmx.org/posts/2020-11-24-htmx-1.0.0-is-released/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type="text"><p>If someone had told me a decade ago that I was going to produce the first (and, so far, only) published reconstruction of Chopin's posthumous Mazurka in F Minor that includes every uncanceled measure of the composer's sketch, I would have laughed. But apparently when a performance opportunity inspires a research obsession, unexpected things can happen.</p><p>I'm no piano virtuoso, but for some years I've performed chamber music and solo programs on a church recital series. As a student I learned Fauré's B-Minor Nocturne; Scriabin's Preludes, Op. 74; and Scott Joplin's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Magnetic Rag</em>—each of which is its respective composer's last completed composition for solo piano (and in the case of the latter two, the composer's last completed composition). Eventually I had the idea of performing an entire recital of such works, adding Schubert's Sonata in B-flat, D. 960; Schumann's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Ghost Variations</em>; Brahms's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Klavierstücke</em>, Op. 119; and the piece that is generally considered Chopin's last: the Mazurka in F Minor, Op. 68, No. 4.<br></p><p>Of these last completed piano works, the mazurka was the least finished. Chopin customarily composed at the piano, then notated a sketch, and lastly wrote a fair copy. But for the work published posthumously as Op. 68, No. 4, he only got as far as the sketch, a confusing one-page document that was discovered after his death in 1849.<br></p><p>Virtually all editions of the complete Chopin mazurkas include the same sixty-two-bar A–B–A version published in 1855 by former Chopin copyist Julian Fontana, based on a fair copy by cellist Auguste Franchomme, a close friend of the composer and dedicatee of his Cello Sonata. (The Henle edition exactly follows Franchomme's copy, which is more accurate in several respects than Fontana's published version.) But I was aware of a longer version from pianist Arthur Rubinstein's 1967 RCA recording of the complete Chopin mazurkas—a 1965 reconstruction by Polish pianist-musicologist Jan Ekier that adds a C section in F major. I purchased a copy of this A–B–A–C–A version and assumed I'd play it on my recital.<br></p><p>Looking up the work in Maurice Hinson's <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Guide to the Pianist's Repertoire,</em> however, I learned of a more complete 1975 reconstruction by British pianist Ronald Smith as published by Hansen House. It turned out to be out of print, but I tracked down a copy via interlibrary loan. The C section in Smith's A–B–A–C–A version is thirtytwo bars, versus sixteen in Ekier's; in his foreword, Smith specifically criticizes Ekier's version, saying that it "takes a disastrous short-cut in the F major episode."<br></p><p>Wondering whether there had been any other published reconstructions, I of course did a Google search, which led me to "Chopin's Last Style," an article by the eminent Chopin authority Jeffrey Kallberg that appeared in the Summer 1985 issue of the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> and was republished with slight emendations as a chapter in his 1996 book <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and Musical Genre</em>. Kallberg contends that the piece's form is actually A–B–A–C–A–B–A, which struck me as the solution to one riddle in the sketch— the two different versions of the left hand of the B section's last measure (the second version is printed as an ossia passage in the Ekier and Smith editions). It seems likely that one version of that measure is intended for the first B section, the other for the second B.<br></p><p>Kallberg also provides a detailed summary of the various attempts to reconstruct the piece, which in turn led me to two other versions: an edition by Polish composer-pianist Milosz Magin, published in 1983 by Editions Concertino of Paris, and British pianist John Vallier's 1986 edition (now out of print) of a reconstruction by British musicologist Arthur Hedley, who as the first modern scholar to view the sketch in 1951 had discovered the long-missing C section. The thirty-two-bar C section in Magin's A–B–A–C–A version is structurally identical to Smith's. The form of the Hedley-Vallier version is (as Kallberg proposed) A–B– A–C–A–B–A, with the aforementioned slight variation at the end of the second B; but its final A section is oddly truncated, and the thirty-two-bar C section includes material that is clearly crossed out in the sketch.<br></p><p>In "Chopin's Last Style," Kallberg states that "numerous attempts have been made to decipher the document, none entirely successful." Playing through the four published versions, I couldn't help drawing the same conclusion; I could not see performing any of the four verbatim. So I thought I'd put together a composite version, just for my own personal use, incorporating the most convincing readings from the various editions.<br></p><p>But how does one make those decisions? My own sense of musical style, and of Chopin's style in particular, provided a general basis. Ultimately, though, I had to study the sketch itself, a facsimile of which was printed in several of the published editions.</p><p>One of the first spots I examined was a segment that Kallberg cites as having been omitted in previous reconstructions (Ekier, Magin, and Smith all fail to include it): the bass-clef passage that Chopin labeled 3ci (an abbreviation for <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">trzeci</em>, Polish for "third"). Kallberg's article interprets this segment as the left hand for the transition to the second B section, and the Hedley- Vallier edition adopts that interpretation as well. I took one look at this passage in the sketch and—to my great surprise—drew a completely different conclusion.</p><p>The passage consists of a quarter note and four eighth notes, connected by an ascending slur (the only slur in the entire sketch) that continues up and to the right of the last note; the beam over the eighth notes also continues up and to the right of the last note. To me, this looked like shorthand for an ascending tonic arpeggio that continues upwards (despite the fact that the last notated pitch is a D-flat, which sounds wrong even if the passage is used as a transition to the second A; Kallberg now conjectures that Chopin intended this note to be a C). And the function of the passage seemed clear to me as well: a little extra flourish to distinguish the final iteration of A as the end of the piece. Indeed, the A section ends three different ways—first leading to B, later leading to C, and finally ending the piece—and Chopin specifically labels this ending the "third." (I find it highly unlikely that the passage represents the second A-to-B transition. My examination of all the Chopin sectional dances—the mazurkas, polonaises, and waltzes—reveals that in A–B– A–C–A–B–A rondos where the first and second B sections are in the same key, the second transition from A to B is always identical to the first.)<br></p><p>But the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">3ci </em>passage isn't the only sketch segment that is typically omitted. At the end of the C section, Chopin wrote one measure above the staff in (presumably) treble clef and one measure plus a quarter note below the staff in bass clef. Ekier, Smith, and Magin include the former but omit the latter; Hedley-Vallier includes the latter but omits the former. No previous reconstruction had included every measure of the sketch that Chopin had not crossed out. So I made up my mind that my version would be the first—and this required figuring how to incorporate both these segments at the end of the C section. Thinking more as a composer than as a musicologist, I came up with a solution that seemed to make musical sense.<br></p><p>Barely had I drawn these conclusions than I began to question how I could have solved riddles that had stumped a whole series of eminent Chopin specialists. So first I sent my reconstruction to an esteemed scholar who has dealt extensively with another composer's manuscripts. She was quite encouraging, as were the other editors and teachers I then asked to review my work. Eventually I got up the nerve to send my version to Jeffrey Kallberg himself, who responded, "You've solved a number of puzzling passages that have eluded other researchers, including myself (I'm thinking especially of your very sensible rendition of measure 95 [the end of the C section])." He also generously provided a great deal of critical feedback that led to numerous improvements in both my reconstruction and the accompanying editorial notes.<br></p><p>By this time, I realized that my version might well be of interest to other pianists and scholars, so I began submitting it for publication, and fortunately Richard Walters of Hal Leonard decided to issue it as part of that company's Schirmer Performance Editions series. It appeared in print in 2012—the year after I gave its premiere performance on my last-completed-pianoworks recital.<br></p><p>All music schools try to link performance and scholarship. But sometimes, by pure serendipity, one leads seamlessly to the other—and then back again.<br></p></div></div>]]>

I would summarize it for you or offer pull-quotes but honestly you just have to read it yourself because it's mind-blowing. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">The original article</a> is now deleted from the Johns Hopkins website ... for some reason. Luckily the internet is forever and it's available via<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19"> the Wayback Machine</a>. Here is the article in its entirety:</p><p>* * *</p><p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/21/covid-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths">new data</a>, the U.S. currently ranks first in total COVID-19 cases, new cases per day and deaths. Genevieve Briand, assistant program director of the Applied Economics master's degree program at Hopkins, critically analyzed the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in her webinar titled "COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data."</p><p>From mid-March to mid-September, U.S. total deaths have reached 1.7 million, of which 200,000, or 12% of total deaths, are COVID-19-related. Instead of looking directly at COVID-19 deaths, Briand focused on total deaths per age group and per cause of death in the U.S. and used this information to shed light on the effects of COVID-19.</p><p>She explained that the significance of COVID-19 on U.S. deaths can be fully understood only through comparison to the number of total deaths in the United States.</p><p>After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared.</p><p>Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.</p><p>"The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals," Briand said.</p><p>Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p><p>These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.</p><p>This comes as a shock to many people. How is it that the data lie so far from our perception?</p><p>To answer that question, Briand shifted her focus to the deaths per causes ranging from 2014 to 2020. There is a sudden increase in deaths in 2020 due to COVID-19. This is no surprise because COVID-19 emerged in the U.S. in early 2020, and thus COVID-19-related deaths increased drastically afterward.</p><p>Analysis of deaths per cause in 2018 revealed that the pattern of seasonal increase in the total number of deaths is a result of the rise in deaths by all causes, with the top three being heart disease, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia.</p><p>"This is true every year. Every year in the U.S. when we observe the seasonal ups and downs, we have an increase of deaths due to all causes," Briand pointed out.</p><p>When Briand looked at the 2020 data during that seasonal period, COVID-19-related deaths exceeded deaths from heart diseases. This was highly unusual since heart disease has always prevailed as the leading cause of deaths. However, when taking a closer look at the death numbers, she noted something strange. As Briand compared the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018, she noticed that instead of the expected drastic increase across all causes, there was a significant decrease in deaths due to heart disease. Even more surprising, as seen in the graph below, this sudden decline in deaths is observed for all other causes.</p><mediatag id="57319"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the number of deaths per cause during that period in 2020 to 2018.</i></p><p>This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</p><mediatag id="57320"></mediatag><p><i>Graph depicts the total decrease in deaths by various causes, including COVID-19.</i></p><p>The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease.</p><p>"All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary," Briand concluded.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The News-Letter</i>, Briand addressed the question of whether COVID-19 deaths can be called misleading since the infection might have exacerbated and even led to deaths by other underlying diseases.</p><p>"If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification," Briand replied.</p><p>In other words, the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the U.S. is considered problematic only when it increases the total number of deaths or the true death burden by a significant amount in addition to the expected deaths by other causes. Since the crude number of total deaths by all causes before and after COVID-19 has stayed the same, one can hardly say, in Briand's view, that COVID-19 deaths are concerning.</p><p>Briand also mentioned that more research and data are needed to truly decipher the effect of COVID-19 on deaths in the United States.</p><p>Throughout the talk, Briand constantly emphasized that although COVID-19 is a serious national and global problem, she also stressed that society should never lose focus of the bigger picture — death in general.</p><p>The death of a loved one, from COVID-19 or from other causes, is always tragic, Briand explained. Each life is equally important and we should be reminded that even during a global pandemic we should not forget about the tragic loss of lives from other causes.</p><p>According to Briand, the over-exaggeration of the COVID-19 death number may be due to the constant emphasis on COVID-19-related deaths and the habitual overlooking of deaths by other natural causes in society.</p><p>During an interview with <i>The</i> <i>News-Letter </i>after the event, Poorna Dharmasena, a master's candidate in Applied Economics, expressed his opinion about Briand's concluding remarks.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still a deadly virus. And over-exaggeration or not, to a certain degree, is irrelevant," Dharmasena said.</p><p>When asked whether the public should be informed about this exaggeration in death numbers, Dharmasena stated that people have a right to know the truth. However, COVID-19 should still continuously be treated as a deadly disease to safeguard the vulnerable population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Facebook and Twitter will certainly block this article within hours of its publication. Just like Johns Hopkins deleted it from its site. The question is ... why?</p><mediatag id="57334"></mediatag><mediatag id="57329"></mediatag><mediatag id="57331"></mediatag><mediatag id="57332"></mediatag><p>* * *</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: JHU tweeted that they deleted the article because it "was being used to support false and dangerous inaccuracies about the impact of the pandemic."</p><mediatag id="57420"></mediatag><p>Importantly, they didn't say anything in the article was incorrect. So we're just memory-holing studies that don't align with the narrative? Got it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1606480641864" id="item-5fc0f2d33f75b16643f61aae"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-3e269a4e320cdf7cc7e4"><div><p data-preserve-html-node="true">This is a follow-up post to <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1">“Running Docker on Apple Silicon M1”</a>, continuing the journey of exploring Docker on Apple’s new M1 machines.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="aadfc8dfc4dedfeadfc8dfc4dedf">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="582d3a2d362c2d1869616a76696e60766e6c7660">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6b1e091e051f1e2b5a5259455a5d53455d5f4553">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="88fdeafde6fcfdc8b9b1baa6b9beb0a6bebca6b0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm
Successfully created context <span>"myvm"</span>
<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm
<span>~</span>
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<span>~</span>
❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome. Listening to text articles requires sending them to a special app and converting articles to ebooks is annoying and loses a lot of formatting and navigation.</p></li><li><p>I love to respond to a person’s recommendation - preferably before they’ve forgotten why they sent me it in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a centralized history of content tied to my notes and annotations in case I want to find it again later. It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago. Too often I default to the lower-friction one.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></p><h2 id="a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">A universal book log, recommendation &amp; sharing system&nbsp;<a href="#a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">#</a></h2><p>I love exploring other peoples’ reading lists. Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow. The current Twitter search makes me feel like I’m using a government site created before I myself even knew what a computer was.</p></li><li><p>Help me <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kmch6T2YscMyLFJD9/rational-reading-thoughts-on-prioritizing-books">deal with prioritization</a>. My reading list is a mess and I can’t be alone. Are certain books better read before others? Prerequisites? Could three of them be replaced with one? What are the other books by the this author? Are they worth reading too? Why exactly did I think reading this 800 page book was relevant when I added it? <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/">Is 80% of the content attainable from a blog post?</a> Where is that post?

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:

42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<![CDATA[SQLite as a Document Database]]>
            </title>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>

<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>
