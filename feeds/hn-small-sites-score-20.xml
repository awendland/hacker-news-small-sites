<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/">← Back to Kevin's homepage</a><span>Published: 2021 March 7</span></p><p>I’ve spent the last year <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>, which has included writing firmware for a variety custom circuit boards.</p>

<p>I initially wrote this firmware in Rust, but despite years of experience with that language I still struggled quite a bit.
I eventually got my keyboards working, but it took an embarrassingly long time and wasn’t <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>After repeated suggestions from my much more Rust-and-computing-experienced friend <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>, I rewrote the firmware in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which turned out swimmingly.</p>

<p>I found this quite surprising, given that I’d never seen Zig before and it’s a pre-1.0 language written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_kelley">fellow PDX hipster</a> with basically just a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.7.1/">single page of documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The experience went so well, in fact, that I now feel just as likely to turn to Zig (a language I’ve used for a dozen hours) as to Rust (which I’ve used for at least a thousand hours).</p>

<p>This, of course, reflects as much about me and my interests as it does about either of these languages.
So I’ll have to explain what I want from a systems programming language in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to explain why I struggled with Rust I’ll have to show a lot of complex code that I’m obviously unhappy about.
My intent here is not to gripe about Rust, but to establish my (lack of) credibility: It’s so you can judge for yourself whether I’m using Rust’s features in a reasonable way or if I’ve totally lost the plot.</p>

<p>Finally, while it risks falling into the dreadfully boring “language X is better than Y” blog trope, I feel that it’d be more helpful to some readers if I explicitly compare Rust and Zig, rather than write a wholly positive “Zig’s great!” article.
(After all, I’d steadily ignored six months of Jamie gushing about Zig because, “that’s great buddy, but I already know Rust and I just want to get my keyboard done, okay?”)</p>

<h2>What I want from a systems language</h2>

<p>I was educated as a physicist and learned programming so I could make data visualizations.
My first languages were PostScript and Ruby (dynamic, interpreted languages) and I later moved to JavaScript so I could draw on the web.
That led me to Clojure (using ClojureScript to draw on the web), where I’ve spent much of my career.</p>

<p>In 2017 I decided to learn a systems language.
Partly this was intellectual curiosity — I wanted to become more familiar with concepts like the stack, heap, pointers, and static types which had remained mucky to me as a web developer.
But mostly it was because I wanted the capabilities that systems languages promised:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To write code that was <em>fast</em>; that could take advantage of how computers actually worked and run as fast as the hardware allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>To write applications that could run in minimal environments like microcontrollers or web assembly where it just isn’t feasible (in time or space) to carry along a garbage collector, language runtime, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My interest was not (and still isn’t) in operating systems, programming language design, or safety (with respect to memory, formal verfiability, modeling as types, etc.).</p>

<p>I just wanted to blink the litle squares on the screen on and off very quickly.</p>

<p>Based on its growing popularity in the open source community and tons of beginners-to-systems-programming documentation, I picked up Rust around version 1.18.</p>

<p>Since then, Rust has undoubtedly helped me achieve those capabilities I was after: I was able to compile it to WASM for a <a href="https://github.com/lynaghk/subform-layout">layout engine</a>, build and sell a <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda">fast desktop search app</a> (Rust <a href="https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/">shoved into Electron</a>), and compile Rust to an stm32g4 microcontroller to drive a <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_02_robot_update/">track saw robot</a> (I even <a href="https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs/pull/335">found a typo</a> in the register definitions; the full “hard-mode” embedded debugging experience!).</p>

<p>Despite all this, I still don’t feel <em>comfortable</em> with Rust.
It feels fractally complex — seemingly every time I use Rust on a new project, I run into some issue that forces me to confront a new corner of the language/ecosystem.
Developing my keyboard firmware was no exception: I ran into two problems, and each required learning a completely new language feature.</p>

<p>These problems aren’t really specific to embedded, but they’re representative of the sorts of challenges I’ve run into using Rust over the past three years.</p>

<p>If you want the gory embedded details or understand why I’m writing my own firmware using newfangled languages at all, see my notes on <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/keyboards/">building keyboards</a>.</p>

<h2>Conditional compilation</h2>

<p>The first challenge I ran into with Rust was getting my firmware to run on hardware varying from 4-button dev-kit PCBs to the left/right halves of a wireless split to a single <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/typical_keyboards.jpg" alt="Various keyboard hardware"></p>

<p>Varying the features of firmware at compile-time is known as “conditional compilation”.
(It needs to be done at compile-time rather than run-time because microcontrollers have limited program space, roughly 10–100kB in my case.)</p>

<p>Rust’s solution to this problem is “features”, which are defined in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>cortex-m</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>nrf52840-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>nrf52833-hal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.11"</span><span>,</span> <span>optional</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>arraydeque</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.4"</span><span>,</span> <span>default-features</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span>
<span>heapless</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.5"</span>

<span>[features]</span>
<span>keytron</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>keytron-dk</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833"]</span>
<span>splitapple</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840"]</span>
<span>splitapple-left</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>
<span>splitapple-right</span> <span>=</span> <span>["splitapple"]</span>

<span># specify a default here so that rust-analyzer can build the project; when building use --no-default-features to turn this off</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>["keytron"]</span>

<span>nrf52840</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52840-hal"]</span>
<span>nrf52833</span> <span>=</span> <span>["nrf52833-hal"]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For example, the <code>keytron</code> feature is enabled for a specific keyboard hardware design.
That hardware depends on the <code>nrf52833</code> feature (representing a kind of a microcontroller), which depends on the <code>nrf52833-hal</code> crate (actual code which maps that microcontroller’s peripheral memory addresses to Rust types).</p>

<p>My Rust code can then use attribute annotations to conditionally enable stuff.
E.g., a namespace can import the microcontroller-specific crate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52833"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"nrf52840"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>hw</span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>or call the appropriate key scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>unsafe</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>hw</span>::<span>Peripherals</span>::<span>steal</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(any(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>, feature = </span><span>"keytron-dk"</span><span>))]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p0</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>p1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>device</span><span>.</span><span>P1</span><span>.</span><span>in_</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>().</span><span>bits</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>        </span><span>//invert because keys are active low</span>
<span>        </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P0</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>P1</span>::<span>pack</span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>};</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>gpio</span>::<span>splitapple</span>::<span>read_keys</span><span>();</span><span></span>

<span>    </span><span>Packet</span><span>(</span><span>u</span><span>)</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Getting this conditional compilation working required learning a lot of stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>the attribute annotation conditional mini-language (the <code>any</code> in <code>#[cfg(any(feature = "keytron", feature = "keytron-dk"))]</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>optional = true</code> that must be added to the device crates in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (even though the source is already conditionally requiring them!)</li>
<li>how to enable features when building a static binary (<code>cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "keytron"</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I still have many unresolved questions, too!</p>

<p>At some point I gave up trying to pass device peripherals as function arguments because I couldn’t figure out how to add conditional attributes to types — the “obvious” thing doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>(</span><span>port</span>: <span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"splitapple"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52840_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P1</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>#[cfg(feature = </span><span>"keytron"</span><span>)]</span><span></span>
<span>                   </span><span>nrf52833_hal</span>::<span>pac</span>::<span>P0</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Packet</span><span> </span><span>{}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>There’s a neat embedded framework, <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.4/book/en/preface.html">RTIC</a>, whose main entry point is an <code>app</code> annotation that takes the device crate as an, uh, argument:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[app(device = nrf52833)]</span><span></span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>APP</span>: <span>()</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>//your code here...</span>
<span>};</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>How does one conditionally vary this argument at compile-time?
I have no idea.</p>

<h2>Types and macros</h2>

<p>Rust also proved challenging even within a single hardware configuration.</p>

<p>Consider scanning a keyboard matrix: If we don’t have enough microcontroller pins to connect each keyboard switch directly to a pin, we can arrange the switches with diodes (one-way valves) into a matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinlynagh.com/rust-zig/key_matrix.png" alt="circuit schematic of key matrix"></p>

<p>We then set a single column high and read out the the rows to find state of the switches on that column.</p>

<p>In this example, if we set pin 1.10 high (col0) and then read pin 0.13 (row1) as high, we know that switch K8 is pressed.</p>

<p>Pretty simple in theory, but complex in Rust because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device crates expose hardware peripherals as distinct types</li>
<li>One does not simply compute with distinct types in Rust</li>
</ol>

<p>Say I need to initialize all the columns as output pins.</p>

<p>Doing this for a single pin, say peripheral port P0’s pin 10, is simple enough:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>P0</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>10</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>});</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But my column pins are spread across two ports, so what I <em>want</em> to write:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pin</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[(</span><span>P0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>P1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>..</span><span>.]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>port</span><span>.</span><span>pin_cnf</span><span>[</span><span>pin</span><span>].</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>w</span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>input</span><span>().</span><span>disconnect</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span>.</span><span>dir</span><span>().</span><span>output</span><span>();</span><span></span>
<span>        </span><span>w</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>});</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>isn’t going to fly because now the tuples have different types — <code>(P0, usize)</code> and <code>(P1, usize)</code> — and so they can’t hang together in the same collection.</p>

<p>Here’s the solution I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>PinIdx</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>type</span> <span>Port</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>COL_PINS</span>: <span>[(</span><span>Port</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>PinIdx</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>7</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>[(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>13</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>15</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>29</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>17</span><span>)];</span><span></span>

<p>Yup, good ol’ copy-paste to the rescue.</p>

<p>But wait, I hear you asking, what about <em>macros</em>?
Oh yes, my friend, I shaved the macro yak in the actual scanning routine:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>read_keys</span><span>()</span><span> </span>-&gt; …</pre></div></div></div>

    <p>The Bauhaus greatest achievement was to make artists interested in the creative use of technology, to design things that are useful and nice to use. And they did that without knowing a lot about tech.</p>

<hr>

<p>Product, experience, interaction, industrial designers, creative technologists. If somehow you are a creative interested in making things that are useful and nice to use, you owe that to the Bauhaus. It’s also because of that school and their influence on art education that we can enjoy things designed by people with an artistic sensibility. Rather than only having things designed by engineers.</p>

<p>At the time, few artists were willing to collaborate with the industry to create mass-manufactured objects. Architect Walter Gropius, founder and director of the school, was especially passionate about social architecture and in general in creating things for the common people. Mass-manufacturing technology could allow that at scale. So some years after the creation of the school, he adjusted the focus in the Bauhaus curriculum. And since 1925, when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, the school new motto became ‘Art and technology: a new unity’.</p>

<hr>

<p>But despite the ambition of the Bauhaus to teach students how to design for the industry, few of the tutors at the time had experience in industrial production. The school method was still based on a combination of applied arts and academic education, and the students’ practical lessons were given by craftsmen whose experience was in making things by hand and not in designing for production.</p>

<p>For instance, in the metal workshop under Moholy-Nagy, students would handmade prototypes with a style they thought would be easy to reproduce industrially. For instance using spheres, cylinders and other basic shapes. Except that due to their ignorance of industrial processes, those objects were hard to make in a mass-production facility.</p>

<p>But the strongest critique of the Bauhaus lack of technological knowledge was Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was familiar with the work of the Bauhaus due to the Black Mountain College in the US, where he and other former Bauhaus tutors were teaching. According to him, the ‘International Style’ brought to the US by the Bauhaus, simple replaced the previous decorative style with a new simplified one made of basic shapes and colours. A new exterior, but that was leaving unchanged the structural and functional elements of the building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short they only looked at problems of modifications of the surface of end-product, which end-products were inherently sub-functions of a technically obsolete world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Obviously, Bucky did all the things he was criticising Gropius and the Bauhaus about. But that’s a story I’ll save for some other time).</p>

<hr>

<p>The excitement of the Bauhauslers for new technologies is still present among designers now. And so is that limit in understanding fully a new innovation that can be used in a new product or service. I feel that every time I’m working with machine learning. But what the Bauhaus achieved was to get artists interested in bringing their sensibility in the creative use of technology. And whatever Bucky thinks, that remains.</p>

<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.
</p>



<p>
  <small>
  †
  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).
  </small>
</p>


<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
For solutions to exercise problems, refer to this excellent PDF created
by Greg Hurst: <a href="https://greghurst.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf">apostol_intro_to_ant.pdf</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="schedule">Schedule<a href="#schedule"></a></h2>

<p>
Here is the schedule for the upcoming planned meetings:

    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.

      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.

    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.

  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!

  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.

<p>This quickstart guide is inspired by <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">Ruby in Twenty Minutes</a>. It makes the assumption that you already have <a href="https://docs.toit.io/installation/toitcli/">Toit installed</a> on your machine.</p>
<p>Toit is an object-oriented programming language for the internet of things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, simple, and approachable</li>
<li>High-level and object-oriented</li>
<li>Declarative and statically analyzable</li>
<li>Safe and garbage collected</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get started with some programming!</p>
<h2 id="hello_world">Hello, World<a href="#hello_world" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>A local installation of Toit comes with support for running small programs directly from the command line. If you put the following code in a file called <code>hello.toit</code></p>


<p>you can run it from the command line like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<p>What just happened? The <code>toit</code> command line tool read your source code (<code>hello.toit</code>) and started running it from the <code>main</code> method that you defined. The <code>main</code> method consists of all the indented statements just below the method declaration line <code>main:</code>. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces you add to your programs are significant.</p>
<p>Once the program ran, it printed <code>Hello World!</code> in your terminal. This is because the only statement in <code>hello.toit</code> is a method call, where you invoke the <code>log</code> method with a single argument, which is the string to be logged (in this case, printed to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than one line from your program, you could update it to:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  log "Hello World!"
  log "Hello World!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="defining_a_method">Defining a method<a href="#defining_a_method" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another method:</p>


<p>and call that from <code>main</code>:</p>


<p>Calling a method in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the method doesn’t take arguments that’s all you need.</p>
<p>What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name:
  log "Hello $name!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, <code>hi</code> is a method that takes a single argument. We can use that from <code>main</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and it works!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="inserting_strings_in_strings">Inserting strings in strings<a href="#inserting_strings_in_strings" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What’s the <code>$name</code> bit? That’s Toit's way of inserting something into a string. It is called <em>string interpolation</em>. The bit after the <code>$</code> is turned into a string (if it isn’t one already) and then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to make sure that someone’s name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing whitespace is ignored:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>hi name = "World":
  log "Hello, $name.trim!"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This way, we call the <code>trim</code> method on the <code>name</code> string before we insert it into the outer string. If we call <code>hi "   Lars  "</code> we still get the familiar greeting <code>Hello Lars!</code> and not <code>Hello   Lars  !</code>. You can add parentheses around the <code>name.trim</code> expression in the string to make it clearer which parts belong to the outer string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  log "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the code above? We added a default value for the <code>name</code> parameter, so if the name isn’t supplied when you call <code>hi</code>, we use the default name "World". Now we can try:</p>


<p>and get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="evolving_into_a_greeter">Evolving into a greeter<a href="#evolving_into_a_greeter" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for that. Let’s create a <code>Greeter</code> class:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name = "World":

  say_hi: log "Hi $name.trim!"

  say_bye: log "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>The new keyword here is <code>class</code>. This defines a new class called <code>Greeter</code> and a bunch of methods for that class. Pay special attention to the method <code>constructor</code>. There is nothing after the <code>:</code> and the <code>constructor</code> method isn’t followed by any indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>  constructor .name = "World":
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a constructor and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class <code>Greeter</code> takes a single argument (<code>name</code>), but the <code>.</code> prefix to the <code>.name</code> parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on <code>Greeter</code> objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the <code>:=</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The field parameter <code>.name</code> still has a default value, so if we don’t pass a name, the <code>Greeter</code> will greet the world.</p>
<p>The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> methods are introduced on the next two lines. The methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line each. The <code>say_hi</code> and <code>say_bye</code> method both use the <code>name</code> field from the object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method simply by mentioning them (<code>name</code>).</p>
<h2 id="creating_a_greeter_object">Creating a greeter object<a href="#creating_a_greeter_object" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now let’s create a greeter object and use it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, <code>Greeter</code>. The greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings. If we run this, we get the following output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the <code>name</code> method on it:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This would show <code>How are you  Helena ?</code>. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the name isn’t trimmed like we expected. Let’s fix that!</p>
<h2 id="fields_and_methods">Fields and methods<a href="#fields_and_methods" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (<code>_</code>) are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_:= null
  constructor .name_ = "World":
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>This removes the <code>name</code> method from greeters, but if we really want to allow accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the same meaning as before.</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_
  say_hi: log "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Here we use the new keyword <code>return</code> to specify the value a method returns. We could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:</p>


<p>In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we can avoid repeating the call to <code>trim</code>:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_ = "World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say_hi: log "Hi $name!"
  say_bye: log "Bye $name, come back soon."
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>We can check that it works by running:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  log "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>and you should see <code>How are you Erik?</code>. Inside <code>main</code>, we store the greeter in a local variable (<code>greeter</code>) so we can keep referring to the same object. You can think of it as a way to give a specific object a name that is only valid and useful inside the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Just like introducing a member variable, we can use the <code>:=</code> syntax in methods and functions like <code>main</code> to introduce local variables.</p>
<h2 id="greetings_everyone">Greetings everyone!<a href="#greetings_everyone" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>This greeter isn’t all that interesting though, it can only deal with one person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let’s try to build that. We will start with a class definition:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>So MegaGreeter objects have a list of <code>names</code>. The <code>names</code> field is initialized to the empty list (<code>[]</code>). The body of the <code>MegaGreeter</code> constructor adds the given <code>name</code> argument to the end of the list of names. Notice that this is different than using a <code>.name</code> parameter that automatically assigns to the field called <code>name</code>. Mega greeters don't have a single name and no <code>name</code> field, so here the <code>name</code> is just an ordinary parameter that we can use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  log "The names are $greeter.names"
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>will lead to this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
The names are ["World"]
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name = "World":
    names.add name

  say_hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: log "Hello $it!"
  say_bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    log "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say_hi
  greeter.say_bye
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get this output:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ toit execute hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s dive into the new constructs in the next sections.</p>

<p>Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler. Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few single line comments:</p>
<div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<p>Such comments start with <code>//</code> and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.</p>
<p>You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to your code. The general structure is that after a <code>:</code> you can have a single construct if it fits on one line:</p>


<p>or you can add a newline after the <code>:</code> and let the following lines that are indented relative to the outer construct …</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>
