Statistics Canada's analysis of the PIAAC data indicated that more&nbsp;"established immigrants," who had been in Canada longer, were represented in the lowest literacy groups at roughly&nbsp;the same proportion as those born in the country.</p>    <p>However, the lowest-scoring groups&nbsp;also include&nbsp;a significant number of Indigenous people in Canada, as well as English and French speakers&nbsp;born in this country.</p>  <p>It's important to separate out those born in Canada from&nbsp;those born abroad, because while some immigrants may struggle with a new language, a significant number also have extensive job experience and education&nbsp;and are highly skilled in their original languages.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/monica-das.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/monica-das.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/monica-das.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/monica-das.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/monica-das.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5876360.1610817959!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/monica-das.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Monica Das, executive director of Edmonton's Project Adult Literacy Society, says it's important to recognize that low literacy doesn't mean a lack of skills.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Monica Das)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Those&nbsp;born and raised in Canada who struggle with language, math and computer proficiency, on the other hand, are less visible because, as advocates put it, they're very good at "faking it."</p>  <p>"They tend to hide this fact from everyone because of the fear of being called names," said Monica Das, executive director of Project Adult Literacy Society (PALS) in Edmonton.</p>  <p>"'Dumb, stupid, crazy, handicapped' and other words are used to describe you as soon as you identify yourself as someone who struggles with reading and writing."</p>  <h2>Deep 'shame' felt by native English speakers</h2>  <p>Native English speakers make up about half of the clients who turn to PALS for help, Das&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>Eddy Piché, 59, is one of them.</p>  <p>The Edmontonian spent nearly 30 years driving trucks all over Ontario and Alberta before coming to terms with what he called his "shame."</p>  <p>"Some people, like, come out of college, university, they use big words and all that stuff," Piché said.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.png" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.png" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>I have come to the conclusion that <em>Software Engineering is primarily a learning endeavour, the working code is rather a side effect</em>.</p>
<p>This quote is actually not mine but I am paraphrasing Alberto Brandolini who is making this very point in <a href="https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming">Event Storming</a> (he was actually talking about Software Development, but I do not want to get into an academic discussion on the differences between Software <em>Engineering</em> and <em>Development</em> and I am treating them as being equal here).</p>
<p>I have actually always been thinking of Software Engineering (SE) as a learning process, but it was only until I read Brandolinins <em>Event Storming</em> where I found this view expressed in such clarity, which also made it clear to me that I, myself have been seeing SE in this very way. In short: for any non-trivial SE project, the main challenge is understanding the domain, which is primarily a learning process. This view is also very prominent in the Domain-Driven Design community and was expressed by Eric Evans himself: <em>The critical complexity of most software projects is in understanding the domain itself.</em></p>
<p>It is no surprise that agile processes have been proven to be so successful and useful: they emphasise <strong>collective learning</strong>. What is even better is that agile is a very scientific approach to SE: we fornulate hypotheses from discussions (among developers <strong>and</strong> customer) and then test them in experiments to arrive at new insights and deeper understanding. Plan-based processes on the other hand are a rather inductive aproach, based on many assumptions which are not tested and verified until the very end (just ask yourself: would you approach your Ph.D. in that way?)</p>
<p>When we finally acknowledge that SE is a learning process then we need to structure the methodologies, processes, tools and technologies around it to create an environment where quick, shared learning can happen through continuous experimentation and feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight requirements allowing for quick understanding of the domain and what and why to implement for whom: <em>Impact Maps (Godzic), Event Storming (Brandolini), User Stories, User Story Mapping (Patton)</em>.</li>
<li>A lightweight development and engineering process with emphasis on collective learning through continuous feedback: Agile / <em>Scrum</em> with <em>eXtreme Programming</em> (XP) practices.</li>
<li>A suitable design methodology which emphasises collective learning and experiments: <em>Domain-Driven Design</em></li>
<li>The most suitable architecture for the problem at hand, found by applying careful prototyping.</li>
<li>A programming language which makes it easier to map the domain into code: object-oriented, something along <em>Java, C#</em>,… (I am actually going to do research on using Haskell for that, but that is a topic for another post)</li>
<li>Technology which lets developers focus on the learning of the domain instead of dealing with low-level plumbing: <em>Spring, Thymeleaf, REST, React/Angular/Vue/…, Hibernate, Web, Mobile, IDEs</em>,…</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my firm belief that learning SE requires to apply it in the same way as learing a programming language requires us to apply it. Yes, when learning how to program we have books and slides and lecture notes describing the language and concepts but they always come with exercises. It is a mystery to me how we can write SE books which ignore that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the SE textbooks I have read and studied (I had a fair share of them…) seems to embrace all of the above in any deeper way, and just throws a checklist of the usual topics at the reader in a rather very academic, dry and boring way. These books seem to treat SE simply as a collection of methodologies, processes, tools and technologies as a means to an end in itself which need to be applied <em>somehow</em>. A student who works through them has acquired lot of book knowledge about SE but has no clue how to <strong>really</strong> put it together and how the knowledge <strong>really</strong> relates to real-world SE. Even worse, the idea that SE is a learning process is not communicated in any of the SE textbooks I know. I think one of the main reason this is the case is that all these books have been written a long time ago and have only been extended with “newer” topics such as Agile / Web / Cloud / Whatever but have been sticking to the same end 90s/early 2000s SE mindset (just think about it: <em>Sommerville</em> is in its 10th edition now…),</p>
<p>Therefore, it is my aim to write a textbook book on applied, modern SE which is going to embrace all discussed issues above - I feel it is a very much needed textbook. It will be based on my teaching experience from my SE course at the FHV, paired with real-world experience from myself and industry partners. At the moment it is just a vision in my head but I want to get into it as soon as possible. Uunfortunately not before Spring 2022 as I will be occupied with a heavy load of teaching until then but this will give me enough time to earn more experience in teaching SE and reflecting my approach to the book which I will share in future posts.</p>

<h2><span id="The_problem_with_writing_advice">The problem with writing advice</span></h2>



<p>The problem with the likes of Steven Pinker and Helen Sword is that they like their own writing way too much. But I don’t. Like their writing, that is. [1] I want to get some information from them and I want to get examples and counterexamples for the points they make. I want them to get to the point. I am not reading them for enjoyment, that’s what fiction is for. I am reading them to learn what they have to say and I have to wade through a morass of stories, pointless metaphors, geysers of words. They are aiming for eloquence but effluence would be a better term for what their reader gets.</p>



<p>Of course, they get high praise and esteem from their peers, everybody wants to write like Pinker, Gladwell or Sword. And obviously many people buy and read their books. So they must be doing something right. But my claim is that they focus far too much of crafting their sentences and far too little time on crafting their advice.</p>



<p>And what’s worse, they promote an environment where ‘writing well’ with style or panache is seen as a virtue. People are praised for that sort of writing and others are encouraged to emulate them. Sentences like “This was so well written, why can’t more academics write like this” proliferate. But it misidentifies the problem. When academic writing is bad, it is not because of the opacity of prose but rather because of the paucity of scrupulous argumentation.</p>



<h2><span id="Defending_academic_writing">Defending academic writing</span></h2>



<p>The complaint that academic writing is needlessly dense and abstruse has become a cliche and gets far too little examination. Nobody (except many frustrated readers) is officially complaining that non-fiction writing is needlessly flowery and sprawling across many more pages than necessary. It prides itself on taking the reader on a journey of discovery but it’s actually all smoke and mirrors.</p>



<p>There is only one criterion that we should require of academic writing and that is the same requirement we should have of academic thinking. Scruples. Scrupulous writing will let the reader in on the uncertainty of knowledge, and messiness of the process of how knowledge is created. It will not try to write a press-release while presenting its argument. And it will not waste the reader’s time by taking them on a journey. Starting every single point it wants to make with a story!</p>



<h2><span id="Starting_with_academic_reading">Starting with academic reading</span></h2>



<p>Academic writing needs to start with the recognition of what academic reading looks like. The vast majority of academic writing is not read like fiction or popular non-fiction. It is read to get the piece of information one needs or to get a gist of what the overall point is. So, having a clear outline with descriptive titles would be much more important than removing unnecessary adverbs. Having an abstract that summarises the key points made in bullet points helps more than using active verbs. Using vocabulary appropriate to the needs of the audience is much more useful than trying to avoid jargon or acronyms.</p>



<p>The first advice you need to give to an academic writer is not to read a book on stylish writing but rather to read how people in their field are writing. Because those are their potential readers. And in their writing, we see what they are expecting. So anything written in the manner they expect will make reading easier for them. Because there is no academic writing as such, there is only writing within disciplines and communities. And barging into a community and trying to change what it’s doing without invitation is not stylish, it is rude. [2]</p>



<p>Why are people reading and why are people writing? They are reading to discover the argument that the author is putting forward. And they are writing to put debate the arguments of others and to put forth more of their own. Their success in doing so should be our primary criterion. The success of academic writing is not some abstract readability score but the ability of the peers to identify and debate the argument it puts forward. [3]</p>



<h2><span id="Practical_advice_on_composition_Shorter_sentences">Practical advice on composition: Shorter sentences</span></h2>



<p>This is where we can give some practical advice. And the advice can be summarised in 3 words: 1. Write 2. shorter 3. sentences. Ignore everything about passives, jargon, conversational writing, whatever else the latest guide puts forward. Focus on keeping your average sentence to about 15 words. Not every sentence has to be that short but if you keep the average somewhere between 15 and 20 words, your writing will be easier to read.</p>



<p>Keeping sentences short is not only good for the reader, it is also good for the writer. Often a long sentence means muddled thought. If I find a sentence I wrote that’s longer than say 30 words, I often also find that the thought behind it is not clear enough. I had an idea in my mind that had too many assumptions and I had not put enough work into parsing out all the connections.</p>



<p>But not always, sometimes a longer sentence is better for both the writer and the reader. Text that is easy to understand is cohesive as well as coherent and too many short clauses will lack cohesion. The reader needs to know which things link together and making that explicit will make the text better.</p>



<p>The good news is that sentence length is easy to check without having to learn opaque grammatical concepts. We know that <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html">people most exercised about passives</a> are least likely to actually spot them in the sentence. So why should we expect normal writers to pay attention to parts of speech or fine details of sentence structure. But anybody can paste their text into the free <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Writer</a> and see if they can shorten the sentences highlighted in red.[4] Doing it regularly will also give you a chance to focus on how sentences are put together.</p>



<h2><span id="Structure_is_king_Rich_outlines">Structure is king: Rich outlines</span></h2>



<p>If you really care about your readers, make sure you make the outline of your writing explicit. Don’t just mark the normal sections like: Introduction or Conclusions. That is helpful for navigation but not understanding. Put headings inside these sections and have them every few paragraphs to summarise what you’re trying to say in those paragraphs. This will aid readers who are not reading your text in sequence to get the gist and also not to miss important points.</p>



<p>You may complain about the youths today not spending enough time on deep reading, but paradoxically, if the structure is marked clearly enough, people are likely to read more of the actual text, as well, because it breaks the work into smaller chunks. Particularly students or novices are often horrified by the walls and walls of undifferentiated texts they are asked to climb. Dividing it into smaller, labelled chunks makes the text more approachable and more likely to be read.</p>



<p>This rich outlining can be done while planning your writing, during writing or during revision. I often don’t start with an outline because I’m not yet clear on exactly what I want to say. But I always create an outline at some point. It helps me discover all the missing and inconsistent bits that are so easy to miss in an extended narrative.</p>



<p>And, finally, if you have an outline, share it with the reader. Put it at the top of the text. It could be a table of contents or just a list of bullets. Better still, put it in the abstract. It is infuriating, reading an abstract that says what the paper tries to show and not what it actually showed. [4]</p>



<h2><span id="All_you_need">All you need</span></h2>



<p>And that’s it, clear explicit structure and moderately shorter sentences. No stories, no metaphors, no flourishes. No avoidance of passives or reduction of adverbs. No worries about technical language. Just these two. They will not only make the academic writing easier to read, they will also make it more scrupulous.</p>



<h2><span id="Self-criticism">Self-criticism</span></h2>



<p>Do I write as I say? Not always and not always perfectly. Some of my sentences do get long and my composition tends to the flowery. For example, the sentence about the importance of shorter sentences is the longest one of this post at 43 words. I thought about breaking it up but I liked its rhythm, so I left it. But my average sentence is 14 words and this makes the overall readability higher.</p>



<p>But that is the lot of anyone who writes about writing. The more strident your strictures, the more likely you are to <a href="https://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/168">fall afoul of them</a>.</p>



<h2><span id="Notes">Notes</span></h2>



<p><strong>[1]</strong> For those who do not routinely read books on writing. The title of the post refers to a book by Steven Pinker “The Sense of Style” which is a lot to wade through for not very much useful advice. The other book I complain about is Helen Sword’s “Stylish Academic Writing”, which overall has better and more actionable advice than Pinker. But the problem with Sword is that many of the examples she sets out to change actually don’t need changing that much. And the examples she singles out for praise are questionable.</p>



<p><strong>[2]</strong> The advice about how important it is pay attention about the language of the community you’re writing for is best summarised by Larry McEnerney in his talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&amp;list=PLEl9d2qvKkBslX4kb0bG2mWmiSKYDGBdC&amp;index=3">Writing beyond the academy</a>.</p>



<p><strong>[3]</strong> The importance of thinking about your writing as communicating with interested peers is often made by Thomas Basbøll) on his <a href="https://blog.cbs.dk/inframethodology/">blog Inframethodology</a>. But it is also the core of the argument of this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25653028?seq=1">paper by Cathy Birkenstein defending Judith Butler</a> against the charge of incomprehensibility.</p>



<p><strong>[4]</strong> The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> also tries to identify passives and adverbs. Feel free to entirely ignore its advice. Also, it computes a readability score which is useful. But all it does is count letters in words and words in sentences. It is easy to game just by randomly inserting periods through out the text. ****</p>

  <p><span>Y</span>ou have a mind-shattering headache. You're standing in the aisle of your local CVS, massaging your temples while scanning the shelves for something—<em>anything</em>—to make make the pain stop.</p>

<p>What do you reach for? Tylenol? Advil? Aleve?</p>

<p>Most people, I imagine, grab whatever's cheapest, or closest, or whatever they <em>always</em> use. But if you're scrupulous enough to ask Google for the best painkiller, here's how your friendly neighborhood tech behemoth would answer:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--692ad5fb57e820714ca1dc70e3b05260aae65913/image-1601262407690.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>Oh thanks Google that's just <em>all of them</em>.</p>

<p>If you're among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/02/01/majority-of-adults-look-online-for-health-information/">77% of Americans</a> that Google their health problems, insipid answers like this won't surprise you. But we should be surprised, because researchers carry out <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e008932">tens of thousands</a> of clinical trials every year. And hundreds of clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of painkillers. So why can't I Google those results?</p>

<p>And so in the year of our lord 2017 I had a <strong>Brilliant Startup Idea</strong>: use a structured database of clinical trials to provide simple, practical answers to common medical questions.</p>

<p>As a proof-of-concept I tried this by hand: I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIx25J54JifJ8qliGnMBlKWn3PdB5sn852blOBfKfJk/">spreadsheet</a> with every OTC painkiller trial I could find and used <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to run a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386629/">network meta-analysis</a>, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-016-0715-4">gold standard</a> of evidence-based medicine.</p>

<p>The results were pretty interesting, and <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing I was looking for back in the sad sterile aisles of CVS:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b560c1e2bdbe33d8ddd1f10436432d3658d62c1b/image-1601347817059.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>A wave of exhiliration washed over me. Here was a problem that</p>

<ol>
<li>Was interesting</li>
<li>Could help people</li>
<li>I knew how to solve</li>
</ol>

<p>A perfect bullseye. After a few hours searching domains I came up with a name for my project: <strong>GlacierMD</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the next nine months I would quit my job, write over 200,000 lines of code, hire five contractors, create a Delaware C-Corp, add four doctors to my advisory board, and demo GlacierMD for twelve Bay Area medical practices. I would spend $40K of my own savings buying clinical trials and paying contractors to enter said trials into the GlacierMD database.</p>

<p>On July 2, 2018, GlacierMD powered the world's largest depression meta-analysis, using data from 846 trials, beating <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext">Cipriani's previous record</a> of 522.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f65968deef4b6b7b836a90d2eee15119b5583f8c/image-1601347863747.jpg" alt="GlacierMD's evidence graph for depression treatments."></p>

<p>Choirs of angels sang in my ears. Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.</p>

<p>Two weeks later GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<hr>

<div><p><span>"T</span>hat's an awesome idea," said Carl. "It sounds like something worth working on."
</p><p>
Carl was my boss. We worked at a startup that leveraged autonomous blockchains to transfer money from naïve investors to slightly less naïve twenty-somethings. There are worse gigs.</p></div>

<p>And here was Carl telling me that my startup idea would bring such benefit to humanity that I simply <em>had</em> to quit, his roadmap be damned. I nodded knowingly, feeling the weight of this responsibility resting on my proud shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thanks Carl," I said. "I'll try to mention you when I accept my Nobel."</p>

<p>I quit two weeks later and started coding at a blistering pace. I drew all sorts of inscrutable diagrams with dry-erase pens on my parents' windows. I hired a motley crew of Egyptian contractors to start entering clinical trials into my database. I commissioned a logo, registered my domain, and started obsessing over color schemes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--da9ab4b5da5f08cc26afe10e0531b89321ff5a24/image-1601347898563.jpg" alt="Data extraction portal for GlacierMD"></p>

<p>When I finally finished the MVP I showed it to the head of product at the company I'd just left. I watched him as he watched my demo, waiting for his eyes to melt with the glory of it all. Instead he just sorta shrugged.</p>

<p>"Lots of people make medical claims on the internet," he said. "Why should I trust yours?"</p>

<p>I started babbling about network meta-analyses, statistical power, and p-values, but he cut me off.</p>

<p>"Yeah okay that's great but nobody cares about this math crap. You need doctors."</p>

<p>Goddamnit he was right. If nobody could be bothered with the math, then I was no better than Gwyneth Paltrow hawking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45426332">vagina eggs</a>. To build trust I needed to get endorsements from trustworthy people.</p>

<p>So I called up some friends, some buddies, some friends-of-friends. "Would you like to be an advisor for my cutting-edge health-tech startup?" I'd ask, while eating Dominos in my parents' laundry room. I'd give them 1% of this extermely valuable, high-growth startup and in exchange I could plaster their faces all over my website.</p>

<p>Four of these doctors agreed. This is called <em>making deals</em> ladies and gentlemen and I was like the lovechild of Warren Buffet and Dr. Oz.</p>

<p>Things are going great. My friends and family all tell me they love the site. Even some strangers on the internet love it. "I know right," I tell them. "So how much would you pay for this?"</p>

<p>"Hahahahahahah," they say in unison. "Good one!"</p>

<p>I forgot that the the first law of consumer tech is <em>nobody pays for consumer tech</em>. But no problemo, I say to myself. This is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> invented ads. I'll just plaster a few banners on GlacierMD and <em>bing bang boom</em> I'll be <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/">seasteading</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a> before <a href="https://burningman.org/">Burning Man</a>.</p>

<p>But then I look at WebMD's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326583/000119312517247147/d391943d10q.htm">10-Qs</a> and start to spiral. Turns out the world's biggest health website makes about $0.50/year <em>per user</em>. That is...not enough money to bootstrap GlacierMD. I'm pouring money into my rent, into my Egyptian contractors, into AWS—I need some cash soon.</p>

<p>What I need are people willing to pay for this thing. What about doctors? Doctors have money, right? Maybe doctors, or practices, or whatever—someone in the medical industry—maybe they would shell out some cash for my on-demand meta-analyses.</p>

<p>So I listened to a few podcasts and became a sales expert. I started cold calling people using scripts from the internet and tried to convince them to sit through a GlacierMD demo.</p>

<p>In the meantime I receive some worrying messages from my Egyptian contractors.</p>

<p>"I think it's time to talk about a raise," one of them says.</p>

<p>"I feel that I have become exceptional at my job," says another. "Please consider a raise or I will stop working."</p>

<p>"Please increase my pay," says the third, including helpful screenshots demonstrating how to give said raise through the Upwork website.</p>

<p><em>Are my contractors unionizing?</em> I wonder. I glance obliquely at my shrinking bank account statement, grit my teeth, and approve the raises. At this rate I'll hit zero in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>But my sales calls start paying off. Miraculously I find some doctors that are willing to talk to me. So I borrow my parents' car and drive out to the burbs to meet a doctor I'll call Susan.</p>

<p>Susan has a small practice in downtown Redwood City, a Silicon Valley town that looks 3-D printed from the Google Image results for <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=main+street&amp;tbm=isch">main street</a></em>.</p>

<p>Susan is a bit chatty (she's a psychiatrist) but eventually I demo GlacierMD. I show her how you can filter studies based on the demographic data of the patient, how you can get treatment recommendations based on a preferred side effect profile, how you can generate a dose-response curve. She <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em> at all the right points. By the end of the interview she's practically drooling.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--927e2748d8adb987b5d491746fcbb3691f186d1b/image-1601347948152.jpg" alt="Comparing the efficacy of two antidepressants over time"></p>

<p><em>Hook, line, and sinker</em> I think to myself. I'm already contemplating what color <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/">Away bags</a> would look best in the back of my <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> when Susan interrupts my train of thought.</p>

<p>"What a fun project!" she says enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Something in her tone makes me pause. "Uh, yeah," I say. "So what would you imagine a product like this—one that could change the very <em>practice</em> of medicine—how much would you pay for such a service?"</p>

<p>"Oh, uh—hmmmm," she said. "I don't know if we can spare the budget here, to be honest. It's very fun...but I'm not sure if our practice can justify this cost."</p>

<p>If you read enough sales books most of them tell you that when people say your product is <em>too expensive</em> what they really mean is your product <em>isn't valuable enough</em>. Susan acted like I was offering her Nirvana as a Service so the conversation has taken quite a wild turn.</p>

<p>"So you don't think this product is useful?"</p>

<p>"Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I'll just prescribe what I normally do, since I'm comfortable with it. But you know it's possible that sometimes I'll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies."</p>

<p>"And that isn't worth something? Prescribing better treatments?"</p>

<p>"Hmmmm," she said, picking at her fingernails. "Not directly. Of course I always have the best interests of my patients in mind, but, you know, it's not like they'll pay more if I prescribe Lexapro instead of Zoloft. They won't come back more often or refer more friends. So I'd sorta just be, like, <em>donating</em> this money if I paid you for this thing, right?"</p>

<p>I had literally nothing to say to that. It had been a bit of a working assumption of mine over the past few weeks that if you could improve the health of the patients then, you know, the doctors or the hospitals or whatever would pay for that. There was this giant thing called <em>healthcare</em> right, and its main purpose is <em>improving health</em>—trillions of dollars are spent trying to do this. So if I built a thing that improves health someone should pay me, right?</p>

<p>I said goodbye to Susan and tried to cheer myself up. I had ten more meetings with doctors all over the Bay Area—surely not all of them were ruthless capitalists like Susan. Maybe they would see the the towering genius of GlacierMD and shell out some cash.</p>

<p>But in fact everyone gave me some version of Susan's answer. "We just can't justify the cost," a pediatrician told me. "I'm not sure it's in the budget," said a primary care physician. "It's awesome," said a hospitalist. "You should try to sell this!" <em>Ugh</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><span>S</span>o in July 2018, nine months and $40K after starting GlacierMD, I shut it down. I fired my contractors, archived the database, and shut down the servers. GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<p><em>Make something people want</em>. It's Y-Combinator's motto and a maxim of aspiring internet entrepreneurs. The idea is that if you build something truly awesome, you'll figure out a way to make some money off of it.</p>

<p>So I built something people wanted. Consumers wanted it, doctors wanted it, <em>I</em> wanted it. Where did I go wrong?</p>

<p>Occassionally I like to disconnect from the IV drip of internet …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2>
<p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the front end development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able to push our application's directory structure on a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW! That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these old applications now, our technical visions didn't end up becoming reality.</p>
<p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demo app, I particularly like using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</code></a>. I love <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact's "no build tools route."</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that's frustrating. Using preact's no build route, finally something like the above is possible:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>import</span> { h, Component, render } <span>from</span> <span>'https://unpkg.com/preact?module'</span>;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> app = h(<span>'h1'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello World!'</span>);</span><br><span>  render(app, <span>document</span>.body);</span><br><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they come preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it's merely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that's promising as it assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that build step.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2>
<p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling. It's not because I don't like ESNext features, but more because I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don't use Typescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stopped using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, I found an excellent library called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript's template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it's not breaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2>
<p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don't feel comfortable or inclined. For example, I never switched to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecycle methods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issues with my sites' performance. I would make the switch if I started to have problems. But I don't. The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I'm already productive with the one I use?</p>
<h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2>
<p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive. But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly write front end tests. Finally, we're able to distinguish between functional code and presentational code. For functional code, we now write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I'm pleased about tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integration tests. I also like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2>
<p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the more features, the better. I'm not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build's size. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn on compression and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps by using tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2>
<p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debugging other people's code. Mainly when it's third-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer's superpower. Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p>
<p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens' principles for writing good code</a>. I "use my own work." Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won't roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It's not to say that I ditch every npm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p>
<p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to my advantage.</h2>
<p>I'm building websites since I'm a teenager. And had I open-sourced and maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I'd be more productive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn't think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age 😂</p>
<p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech, fairness or certain politics. They're still important virtues for me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p>
<p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user's perspective. It means I'm able to think about a piece of code's interfaces emphatically. Additionally, there's positive peer pressure. I'm not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it's going to have a proper README and some docs. And it's going to be tested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's my incomplete list of principles. I'm sure there's more than just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial. I'm sure they won't work for everyone as all our contexts differ. But working solo as a freelancer, I've found that these principles contribute to me being content about what I'm doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and see if they've taken similar paths. Please reach out! Also, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>

          <p>Hey fellow E-Ink enthusiats,</p>
<p>many of you might have heard form the recent Clubhouse buzz. It’s a audio-only social network and got quite a lot of attention in the past months:</p>


<p>I have tried it today for the first time and I’m blown away by the awesome user experience. So how is this related to eink? Well, especially in COVID times we are having more and more screen time and new issues like <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychological-exploration-zoom-fatigue">zoom Fatigue</a> and the like appear. E-ink is (at least partially) about improving the screen ergonomics and healthier display tech for eye strain reduction and eye comfort.</p>
<p>But why not bring this to a new level and have more “audio-only” applications. I could see more work flows being without display. The classical example is a phone call, but it’s more and more coming with WhatsApp audio messages, voice to speek recogntion and the like.</p>
<p>What is the next Clubhouse for X?</p>


<p>Can you imagine having more screen workflows being “screenless”. I think it’s even more natural to use voice and audio than just typing into a screen. Or even better to combine voice, audio and eink. What would be the best ergonomic working station? Eventually even use AI to optimize further?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <p>A <em><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.census.gov%2F2011%2F07%2F20%2Fwhat-are-census-blocks%2F&amp;t=OTU4ZGY1ZGE5YTIwYTU1YTcyMTJkOWRmY2NhZmUwZWYxODgzYTNmMSx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611164115">Block</a></em> is the smallest area unit used by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating statistics. As of the 2010 census, the United States consists of 11,078,300 Census Blocks. Of them, 4,871,270 blocks totaling 4.61 million square kilometers were reported to have no population living inside them. Despite having a population of more than 310 million people, 47 percent of the USA remains unoccupied.</p><p>Green shading indicates unoccupied Census Blocks. A single inhabitant is enough to omit a block from shading.</p><p><strong>Update Jan 2015</strong>: <a href="http://tumblr.mapsbynik.com/post/107762841792/nobody-lives-here-map-prints-available">Prints and canvas of the Nobody Live Here map</a> are now available.</p><p><em>Update 2014.05.01</em>: I’ve received a couple questions about Canada.  Just to be clear, this map is of the United States only. It is based on 2010 data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, which for reasons I hope are apparent, does not include data on our friends in the Great White North. For a similar depiction of Canada, see <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSrefoUG.jpg&amp;t=NjA5Yzc5ZDNlZGZiODY5YzM1NGRlMjE0YzVjNjM2YzlhMTgyZWY0YSx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611164115">this map</a> whipped up by Michael Chung.</p><h2>Map observations</h2><p>The map tends to highlight two types of areas:</p><ul><li>places where human habitation is physically restrictive or impossible, and</li><li>places where human habitation is prohibited by social or legal convention.</li></ul><p>Water features such lakes, rivers, swamps and floodplains are revealed as places where it is hard for people to live. In addition, the mountains and deserts of the West, with their hostility to human survival, remain largely void of permanent population.</p><p>Of the places where settlement is prohibited, the most apparent are wilderness protection and recreational areas (such as national and state parks) and military bases. At the national and regional scales, these places appear as large green tracts surrounded by otherwise populated countryside.</p><p>At the local level, city and county parks emerge in contrast to their developed urban and suburban surroundings. At this scale, even major roads such as highways and interstates stretch like ribbons across the landscape.</p><p>Commercial and industrial areas are also likely to be green on this map. The local shopping mall, an office park, a warehouse district or a factory may have their own Census Blocks. But if people don’t live there, they will be considered “uninhabited”. So it should be noted that just because a block is unoccupied, that does not mean it is undeveloped.</p><p>Perhaps the two most notable anomalies on the map occur in Maine and the Dakotas. Northern Maine is conspicuously uninhabited. Despite being one of the earliest regions in North America to be settled by Europeans, the population there remains so low that large portions of the state’s interior have yet to be politically organized.</p><p>In the Dakotas, the border between North and South appears to be unexpectedly stark. Geographic phenomena typically do not respect artificial human boundaries. Throughout the rest of the map, state lines are often difficult to distinguish. But in the Dakotas, northern South Dakota is quite distinct from southern North Dakota. This is especially surprising considering that the county-level population density on both sides of the border is about the same at less than 10 people per square mile.</p><p><em>Update</em>: On a more detailed examination of those two states, I’m convinced the contrast here is due to differences in the sizes of the blocks. North Dakota’s blocks are more consistently small (StDev of 3.3) while South Dakota’s are more varied in area (StDev of 9.28). West of the Missouri River, South Dakota’s blocks are substantially larger than those in ND, so a single inhabitant can appear to take up more space. Between the states, this provides a good lesson in how changing the size and shape of a geographic unit can alter perceptions of the landscape.</p><p>Finally, the differences between the eastern and western halves of the contiguous 48 states are particularly stark to me. In the east, with its larger population, unpopulated places are more likely to stand out on the map. In the west, the opposite is true. There, population centers stand out against the wilderness.</p><h2>::</h2><p>Ultimately, I made this map to show a different side of the United States. Human geographers spend so much time thinking about where people are. I thought I might bring some new insight by showing where they are not, adding contrast and context to the typical displays of the country’s population geography.</p><p>I’ve all but scratched the surface of insight available from examining this map. There’s a lot of data here. What trends and patterns do you see?</p><h2>Errata</h2><ul><li>Due to a cartographic mishap, the Gulf of California was missing from the original version. Though it was quickly fixed, that version keeps popping up across the Internet. It displeases me I see it, yet I’m amused that people keep reposting it without noticing the error. The geography gods judge those people harshly.</li><li>Some islands may be missing on the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmapsbynik.com%2Fmaps%2Fcensus0pop%2F&amp;t=MzljZjZjMDY3NjY1ZGVmMTlhOTkwN2MzYWNjZWQ1MmRhNDY3NTdiMix4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611164115">hi-res edition</a> if they were not a part of the waterbody data sets I used.</li></ul><h3>::</h3><p>©mapsbynik 2014<br>

		<p>Privacy is a human right, when so much of our life is lived online. In my opinion, the two most evil companies on the planet with a blatant disregard for privacy because it is so fundamental to their business model are: Facebook (and by extension, WhatsApp and Instagram) and Google. A common argument against the need for privacy that I have definitely heard in my family is “but I have nothing to hide”. Well, neither do I and yet so does everyone. Does anyone really appreciate searching on Google for a vacuum cleaner and then seeing photos of vacuum cleaners follow them around all over the web for months afterwards? But I digress: I made a conscious decision to gradually rid myself of Google (Facebook was easier: just delete the app) to the extent possible.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time researching alternatives to each of Google services, and the list below tabulates what I have settled on. Importantly, I have reached the conclusion that viable (and often superior) alternatives exist. Nothing in life is free: one can pay with one’s privacy or with cash. It is no surprise this that most of these below are paid services. Personally, I am more than happy to support businesses where I know what I am paying for and my data is not being pilfered to create some Frankensteinian advertising profile on me.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://ref.fm/u14223513">Fastmail</a> (email, contacts, and calendar): I have been using their email service for over a year now. They are a privacy-respecting email service based out of Australia. They’ve actually been around for a very long time: I remember a college friend in early 2000s (back when they were Fastmail.fm) showing me a cool feature to send a (fake) <em>email undelivered</em> response to an email. I believe they don’t have have that feature in their present-day incarnation. These days my most-used Fastmail feature is their ability to create an unlimited number of email aliases. I can create a new email address for every untrustworthy website and if I start receiving spam on an alias, not only do I know which website was the culprit behind it, but I can simply delete the alias and move on. Another favorite: the ability to block remote images (and as opposed to delivering them over a proxy server — see HEY below) which makes for a pleasant 90s-like (remember mutt?) text-only webmail interface. They have a high quality iOS app with both email and calendar. The service is mature and it has all standard email features (filters, forwarding, IMAP/POP, 2FA etc.). One situation where Fastmail beats Gmail is the ability to send emails from MATLAB or R, or from a cron script running on my own hosted domain: inevitably, these were rejected as “low quality” on Gmail. Well, I am not too keen on letting an AI make that decision for me. Unlike Gmail, Fastmail doesn’t hold immediate push notifications hostage for the native Mail app either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more difficult task was to then go to all the places where I had signed up my Gmail and then replace that with my Fastmail address.</p>
<p>Yes, I do realize that the moment someone sends me an email from Gmail to my Fastmail (or when I respond to them), I am effectively enabling that same advertising profile. But we have to start somewhere and one can only hope that enough people will switch over from the dark side.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>: I mean, have you looked at Google search results lately? Once upon a time they used to be the 10 blue links company with one prominent and easily-identified, textual advertisement at the top. Contrast that with the situation now: it is impossible to find the organic result one wants amongst a sea of distractions and posers (ads cleverly disguised to resemble results). Admittedly, this Google service was the most difficult to be weaned away from, partly because when I tried DDG in the past, the results were less than spectacular. But I think the tide has turned now: DuckDuckGo is a viable and formidable competitor (remember when Google was just that against Altavista?) with two clear benefits: they have no intention to build an advertising profile on their users and there is a clearly demarcated ad at the top followed by organic search results. I am to understand that their results are based on Bing’s index. I would estimate that my average rate of going to Google when DDG can’t find an answer is 1 in 200, which is remarkable!</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.awstats.org/">AWStats</a>: This was easy. I just removed all Google Analytics code from my own domains. I cannot be, in good conscience, an enabler of that (creating advertising profiles based on which webpages a person visits) which I myself oppose.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>: Again, for someone who is 100% on the Mac/iOS bandwagon this is an easy one to accomplish. Of course, I have 1Blocker installed. The recent builds of Safari have this oddly satisfying Privacy Report where one can see how many of these creepy ad-trackers were blocked on a webpage and sometimes it is truly enlightening as to what the real business mode of some of the “free” websites is. For work, where we still use GSuite, I have isolated Gmail etc., into the Chrome browser. Firefox is an excellent alternative to Safari, especially for those not on Mac/iOS.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a>: A nifty little firewall for macOS to both see which apps are phoning back home (and where) as well as block any culprits from doing so. Bonus: they also sell another app called Micro Snitch that alerts the user whenever the camera or microphone are in use.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Apple Maps</strong>: This one is yet another example of a disappointing v1 that has now matured into a viable alternative. Maps is one area where my transition away from Google’s offerings is <em>not</em> complete: I still use Waze regularly mainly for their crowdsourced annotations (crashes, slowdowns, construction, etc.) which are unmatched on any other maps platform.</p>
<p>7. <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a>: This is definitely the new kid on the block. From the folks at Basecamp who have been writing software and books for over 20 years now, this is their “weird” interpretation of what email should be. It’s a bit pricey, no doubt, but what I did like was that I was able to get an OG email address <em>firstinitial lastname</em> @hey.com. HEY deserves a blog post of its own (coming soon).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have taken the first steps in a journey that is likely to be a thousand miles long. By documenting my experiences here, I hope others can learn about these first-class alternatives.</p>

      <p><em>2019, October 11, 00:16:</em> <br>
I finish the cold frozen pizza that I made hours before but forgot to eat, finally write the report, press submit on the Google security bug submission form, and see the classic, <code>Thanks! We received your report.</code> message. That feeling is hard to beat.</p>

<p>I just submitted a bug, using which, I could simply send a link to someone, and when they click on it and visit my website, I could <strong>steal their YouTube watch history</strong>, the <strong>links to watch all of their unlisted videos</strong>, their <strong>Watch Later playlist</strong>, the list of <strong>videos they’ve liked</strong>, and more. It was pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>How was this possible? Let’s go back in time a little bit.</p>

<p><em>Already made some progress? Skip ahead to <a href="#chapter2" target="_self">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="#chapter3" target="_self">Chapter 3</a>, or <a href="#chapter4" target="_self">Chapter 4</a>!</em></p>

<h4 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: <br>Your special playlists you never created</h4>

<p>This issue requires a little bit of understanding about the inner-workings of YouTube. Most importantly, about these four interesting playlists:</p>

<p>Since YouTube is made up of videos, a bunch of internal stuff in YouTube is made up of <strong>playlists</strong>. Everybody has a few of them, even if they have never created one. I knew about these from previous research I have done (<em>by previous research, I just mean trying every feature and trying to understand how they work</em>), before finding this bug. Let’s look at these playlists one-by-one because they will be important later.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch History playlist:</strong></p>

<p>At the time of finding this bug, every YouTube user had a playlist with the ID <code>HL</code>, which stands for “History List” (I assume). This list contained every video you previously watched on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch Later playlist:</strong></p>

<p>You have probably seen the little <code>clock</code> icon everywhere on YouTube, which when pressed, adds the video to your “Watch Later”. This is also just a special playlist internally, with the ID <code>WL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The Liked Videos playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This is a tricky one. At the time of finding the bug, I was a bit confused about how this works, so I had to use a little bit of guessing. All I knew, that it was constructed by somehow modifying your channel ID, which is a 24 char long string, and can be found by going to your channel page, and looking at the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> <span>channel_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a bit of trial and error, and by looking at the playlists of my testing/personal accounts, I figured out a way to “guess” the special “Liked Videos” playlist. You just had to replace the first 3 characters of the channel ID with <code>LLD</code> or <code>LLB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Liked Videos” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>LLDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>”</span><span>LLBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>And finally, the most important, the Uploads playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This special playlist contains <strong>all of your videos</strong>. It has everything in it, regardless of the video’s privacy setting. So all <code>Public</code>, <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos you have ever uploaded, are in your special “Uploads” playlist.</p>

<p>At the time of finding the bug, the same guessing thing had to be used as for the “Liked Videos” playlist, but this time first 3 characters of the channel ID had to be <code>UUD</code> or <code>UUB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Uploads” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>UUDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>”</span><span>UUBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if you don’t want to do any of that, you can just go to the channel’s page, click the <code>Videos</code> tab, and click <code>Play All</code>. But only if that button is visible, which is unfortunately not always the case.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the details about how these playlists have changed since 2019, and how they work today at the time of writing this post, you can check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/xdavidhu/136c7dfa9247e4883c1e4dc7a77350e6">this Gist I made</a>.</p>

<p>So now you know about these special playlists every YouTube user has. Now, you might think that we should just open for example someone’s “Uploads” playlist like you would open any other playlist, and simply leak all of their unlisted videos:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// how to steal someone's unlisted videos (very easy!!)

1. Open https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=[victims-uploads-playlist]
2. Profit!?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. These playlists are special in another way too, which is that <strong>different users will see different videos in them</strong>. If the channel owner opens his/her “Uploads” playlist, she will see all of her videos, regardless of the privacy setting. If an attacker tries to open the victim’s “Uploads” playlist, <strong>only the <code>Public</code> videos will be shown</strong>, any other <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos the victim has will just not be there.</p>

<p>As an attacker, we can clearly see that these playlists can contain very sensitive information about the users. We would like to steal these. But unfortunately, they seem to be well protected…</p>

<h4 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: <br>The Embedded Player and it’s API</h4>

<p>If you have a website and want to have a little YouTube player inside it, there is an app for that. And it’s called the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube IFrame Player</a>. Embedding this player into your website is quite easy, you just have to copy some HTML code with an <code>iframe</code> tag, and paste it into your site’s source:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-18-the-embedded-youtube-player-told-me-what-you-were-watching-and-more/embedded-player.png" alt="Screenshot of an empty webpage with an embedded YouTube player"></p>

<p>But today websites are rarely that simple, so you might wonder, what if I want to dynamically create a YouTube player with JavaScript? What if I want to automatically pause the video? These problems would seem quite hacky, or even impossible in some cases, due to the rules of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin Policy</a>, and other protections modern browsers provide.</p>

<p>Thankfully, YouTube has a solution for this as well, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube Player API</a>. This API allows you to just add a JS library to your site, and then simply create/modify/control the YouTube players on your site however you’d like, using JavaScript. For example, if you want to pause a video, you can just call <code>player.pauseVideo()</code>.</p>

<p><em>Hm..</em> This is pretty interesting, but how does it work? The answer might be obvious if you have previously worked with cross-origin (iframe) communication. The YouTube player uses the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">PostMessage API</a>, which allows different origins (in our case your site and the YouTube iframe), to send each other little messages over a secure channel. So the YouTube player has a <code>postMessage</code> listener where it listens to commands, and the JS library you put into your site sends messages to it when you want to perform some action, like pausing the video. Actually, the YouTube player is talking a lot, even if you don’t ask it anything. It immediately tells the JS library on your site if anything happens with the player. This makes it possible for your site to add event listeners, which get called when for example the user skips into a currently playing video.</p>

<p>Let’s see a quick example of how this communication works under the hood:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this postMessage is sent from your site to the iframe under the hood when you call “player.playVideo()”</span>
<span>-&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span><span>"</span><span>event</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>command</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>func</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>playVideo</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>args</span><span>"</span><span>:[],</span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>channel</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>widget</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

<span>// the iframe sends a lot of stuff back, here are some examples</span>
<span>&lt;-</span> <span>{</span><span>"</span><span>event</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>infoDelivery</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>info</span><span>"</span><span>:{</span><span>"</span><span>playerState</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>currentTime</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>duration</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1344</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoData</span><span>"</span><span>:{</span><span>"</span><span>video_id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>M7lc1UVf-VE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>author</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>""</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>title</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>YouTube Developers Live: Embedded Web Player Customization</span><span>"</span><span>},</span><span>"</span><span>videoStartBytes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoBytesTotal</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoLoadedFraction</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playbackQuality</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>unknown</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>availableQualityLevels</span><span>"</span><span>:[],</span><span>"</span><span>currentTimeLastUpdated_</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1610191891.79</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playbackRate</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>mediaReferenceTime</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoUrl</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7lc1UVf-VE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playlist</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>null</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playlistIndex</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>},</span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>channel</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>widget</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just a reminder, I was often confused about this, but the “under-the-hood” commands I just showed an example of are sent <strong>by your site</strong>. By “under-the-hood”, I just mean that developers usually include YouTube’s library, to make communication easier, and that library simply abstracts the details away, so you can just call <code>pauseVideo()</code>, without worrying about anything else. But of course, if you would want, you could manually send these <code>postMessage</code>s to the player, via plain old vanilla JavaScript, and it would work in the exact same way as using the fancy JS library. So just think of it as an abstraction layer, which you have full control of.</p>

<p>If you want to see what <code>postMessage</code>s a page receives, you could just add an event listener to the page which prints every message to the console:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// listen for all “message” events and log them to the console:</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>message</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>){</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so we can play and pause the player with JavaScript. That’s nothing crazy, but it’s cool. Is there anything else we can do? Yes, there is. Actually, if you read the documentation, there is a bunch of stuff we can do using this Player API. Let’s see some of them that might look interesting to us:</p>

<p><strong>The <code>player.getPlaylist()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you want to embed a playlist into your site, you can use the <code>player.loadPlaylist(playlist_id)</code> method of the library to load a playlist into an existing embedded player. After this, you could call <code>playVideo()</code>, and start playing the first video, after which, the next one from the playlist will automatically start playing, and so on. So we have playlist support.</p>

<p>Now, what if you want to embed a playlist into your site, but want to know what videos are in it? There is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Retrieving_playlist_information">function</a> for that as well. Calling <code>player.getPlaylist()</code>, on a player that has a playlist currently loaded, will return <em>an array of the video IDs in the playlist as they are currently ordered</em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>player</span><span>.</span><span>getPlaylist</span><span>()</span>

<span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>KxgcVAuem8g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>U_OirTVxiFE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rbez_1MEhdQ</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>VpC9qeKUJ00</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"</span><span>LnDjm9jhkoc</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>BQIOEdkivao</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>layKyzA1ABc</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>-Y9gdQnt7zs</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"</span><span>U_OX5vQ567Y</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>ghOqpVet1uQ</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>…</span> <span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good to know..</p>

<p><strong>The not-really deprecated <code>player.getVideoData()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the raw <code>postMessage</code> communication, often you can see an object named <code>videoData</code> being sent by the iframe to the page. This object contains a bunch of stuff about the currently playing video, …</p></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378071300_14862"><div><div><p>An increasingly familiar analysis begins with a vague tale involving rising dissatisfaction with elites, spiralling inequality, and growing political instability. The “twist” is that this describes not a modern Western society, but republican Rome. These comparisons often tend to be shallow, and therefore potentially misleading; is there anything to be learned from them? To answer this question, I turned to the book <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts.</p><p>The key lessons I took from Watt’s narrative could be summarised as follows.</p><p>First, the high degree of social cohesion in early Roman Republic — the critical advantage that helped them defeat their rivals  — was the result of the main source of prestige being not wealth but honours, which were completely controlled by the Republic. Elites competed for such honours by providing services to the state, thereby channelling ambition into pro-social causes. Such a system was probably possible for two reasons. First, the elite was generally small and completely based in the city of Rome. Second, it was composed of wealthy landowners among whom there was little variation in wealth. These two factors taken together probably meant that the only way to rise in status was to obtain the honours granted by state service. </p><p>Second, once Rome began to expand, wealth began to increase due to the spoils of foreign conquest and later the gains from trade. Such wealth began to make the honours bestowed by the state seem somewhat quaint. But aspirant politicians also began to use this wealth to promote themselves, such as by hosting larger gladiator games. Such self-promotion was then leveraged to win offices. This new channel of self-promotion reduced the ability of the state to first require some pro-social efforts in order to obtain an honour. Before, you could only acquire honours by doing the state some service. Later, you could really only acquire honours by first acquiring wealth. </p><p>Once wealth was used to lock-in power, power was used to lock-in wealth. This positive feedback loop eventually incurred a populist backlash, the energies of which were used by successive politicians to undermine the system, to introduce dynastic politics, and eventually to establish an autocracy. </p><p>For a political system to avoid the descent into demagoguery, it needs to prevent a positive feedback loop forming between wealth and power. While the strength of that feedback loop varies across the West, it still seems to pose difficulties in many countries. Eliminating it either requires a reduction of inequality, or else creating a mechanism to prevent people from using wealth to influence the rules and processes regarding the selection of political elites.</p><p>But breaking this loop alone cannot create a cohesive society. For that, a social reward along the lines of the Roman honours system could be useful. In the below essay, I speculate about some ideas for how this idea could be implemented in a modern society. It involves creating a bottom-up selection process in small groups. Safeguards against nepotism or dominance by the wealthy could be overseen by a group that has no monetary wealth and/or children, as such a group would not have the ability and/or incentive to favour their children.</p><p>To understand how I came to take these lessons from the book, read on.</p></div><h3>Introduction</h3><div><p>The ghost of the Roman Empire looms over any discussion on the fate of societies. In the last decade, the course of events has causes the number of comparisons to rise. Trump tried but failed to be a Caesar-like figure in wielding populist sentiment like a weapon against democratic norms. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, compared the 2015 European migration crisis to the <em>Völkerwanderung</em> that heralded the end of the Western Roman Empire. </p><p>But does the story of the very different Roman society actually have lessons for our own? To answer this question, I turned to <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts, Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego. It outlines in detail the events that led to Rome transitioning from essentially a highly cohesive aristocracy to the oligarchic autocracy founded by Augustus. The story starts not when Rome was at its most extensive, but when it was most cohesive — for it was this cohesion that enabled the rapid expansion that would come later. </p></div><h3>A Demonstration of Roman Social Cohesion</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378124246_16527"><div>

He won his first encounter with the Romans but at a cost of between one-sixth and one-half of his most highly trained soldiers. Despite being victorious, he could not continue to sustain such losses. Even worse for Pyrrhus, he couldn’t win the allegiance of any significant Roman allies in the south of Italy, and the Romans had no difficulty in replacing any killed or injured soldiers.

Noting that the Roman interlocutor, Fabricius, was relatively poor, Pyrrhus decided to offer Fabricius “so much silver and gold that he would be able to surpass all the Romans who are said to be most wealthy.” Fabricius refused the offer and Watts recounts his reply as follows:</p><blockquote><p><em>Fabricius, we are told, responded to Pyrrhus by informing him that his assumption was incorrect. Though he did not possess great material wealth, Fabricius told Pyrrhus, he did hold the highest offices in the state, he was sent on the most distinguished embassies, he was called upon to publicly express his opinions on the most important issues, and he was praised, envied, and honored for his uprightness. The Roman Republic, he continued, provided everyone who goes into public service with honors more splendid than any possession. It also regularly made an account of the property of Romans and could easily find anyone who had become wealthy dishonorably. What good would it do, Fabricius supposedly concluded, for him to accept gold and silver when this would cost him his honor and reputation? How could he endure a life in which he and his descendants were wealthy but disgraced?</em></p></blockquote><div><p>Pyrrhus did not win and eventually left Italy for good. But the above example illustrates an interesting point. Fabricius valued honour over possessions and wealth. And more importantly, wealth could not be used to purchase honour.</p><p>Because honour could only be attained by public service, the energies of the most ambitious Romans were channelled towards the common good. According to Watt, “Romans of the third century instead judged each man’s merit by the offices he held, the honors he earned, and whether his achievements equaled those of his ancestors.” This meant that the “Republic dictated what sort of service an individual gave, it determined what sorts of rewards he would receive, and it paid these rewards out in a form of social currency that it alone controlled.”</p><p>The system of honour included a series of offices known as the <em>cursus honorum</em>, where at a given age one was eligible to be elected to a certain post only if one had completed a previous position. The first step involved serving 10 years in the military. After this position and on becoming 30 years of age, one was eligible to run for the position of quaestor (thereby becoming deputy to a provincial governor or a financial administrator). This would last for one year. After this and on reaching 36, one could have served as an aedile. After being an aedile or a quaestor, and being at least 39 years old, one could have run to be a praetor.</p><p>Quaestors, aediles, and tribunes were all elected by the popular assembly and the <em>concilium plebis</em>. After being a praetor and attaining the age of 42 years old, one could have run for the consul position which was perceived as the peak of a career. Again, this position lasted for one year. Consuls and praetors were both elected by the <em>comitia centuriata</em>, which in practice was dominated by the wealthy.</p><p>This system lay within a constitution that seemed to balance the influence of the plebeians and the patricians. Interestingly, it was one where the Senate, made up of former high office holders, only had advisory power in theory but in reality exercised a great deal of informal influence and deference such that little happened without their approval. In a similar discordant fashion, the <em>concilium plebis</em> where the plebeians were represented had a great deal of power in theory — after 287 BC it could unilaterally make laws which bound all Romans — but it rarely exercised this prerogative, partly due to influence from wealthy plebeians. </p><p>This divergence between theory and practise would prove to be a vulnerability later …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># XOR of all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># XOR of all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

        <p><em>Stale Bot’s</em> are a type of automated bot on Github, which locks issues which are “stale” (as in have no recent activity). This seems like a helpful tool at first, but in reality it’s terrible for all parties involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular has a popular repository</a> on github which receives hundreds of issues every day. They use the stale bot to lock old issues, which have no activity in order to reduce the amount of issues in the repository. On the surface the Stale Bot is doing great work, reducing the number of active issues in the repo, but in reality it’s a bit insane.</p>
<h2 id="Maintainer’s-perspective"><a href="#Maintainer’s-perspective" title="Maintainer’s perspective"></a>Maintainer’s perspective</h2><p>Issues are being automatically locked, new users can’t add to issue so they create a duplicate issue, or even worse, just don’t report that the issue still exists!</p>
<h2 id="User’s-perspective"><a href="#User’s-perspective" title="User’s perspective"></a>User’s perspective</h2><p>A user of Angular will <em>Google</em> the error text and will usually find the corresponding github issue. But more often than not, the issue is locked, by the heroic <em>lock bot</em>. So they have a few options, continue searching for another more recent (less SEO’d issue) OR either create another issue, effectively duplicating the bug.</p>
<p>If they decide to create a duplicate issue, it will often not be linked it to the original issue… Now there are 2 issues duplicating the same bug in the Angular repo, so what did “Stale Bot” achieve?</p>
<p>Well the stale bot has had the following effects on the repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the metric of <em>Open Issues</em> in github</li>
<li>Made duplicate issues far more likely</li>
<li>Increased friction of users reporting that the issue still exists</li>
<li>Ultimately decreased the quality of the software, as the issues don’t accurately reflect reality</li>
</ol>
<p>For a moment, imagine that Stack Overflow did this. If there’s no interaction on a question, then the question should be locked… Well questions that don’t get consistent interaction are inevitably duplicated, or not updated with correct information, or people get frustrated and don’t ask the question again.</p>
<p>The best repo’s in my opinion, don’t prevent users from contributing to older issues. This gives a much better user experience, as friction to contribute to issues is much lower. It also lets the maintainers ensure that old issues aren’t needlessly duplicated. Finally, the community feels like the maintainers actually care about their input, which doesn’t feel that way when an automated <em>stale bot</em> locks and closes your inactive issue without any input from a human…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Social media sucks. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are designed to turn your precious free time into money. What we see as a nice way to stay in touch with our friends, in reality are just many hits of dopamine stimulating precise spots in your brain, leading to you spending more time on the platform consuming ads.</p><p>But what if I told you that there is a huge ad-free social network out there, not governed by a central authority, full of great people and completely free to use? This place is called the fediverse. Well, it's not really <strong>a</strong> place, it's many places.</p><h2>What is the fediverse?</h2><p>At its core, the fediverse is a mesh of interconnected nodes on the internet, all communicating in the same language. Every instance on the fediverse implements the <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, which allows it to talk to other instances on the network. The phrase "Fedi" comes from "federated", meaning that content on the network is shared and accessible by anyone.</p><p>There are many different software projects for the fediverse out there. If you like the concept of Twitter, you could take a look at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a microblogging-platform for the fediverse. There's also <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>, a federated clone of YouTube (PeerTube recently <a href="https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/">released support for peer2peer live streaming support</a>, like what?! 🤯). You like instagram? <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> got you covered. Of course, there are many other services worth mentioning, so feel free to dig around a bit! As mentioned, the great thing about the fediverse is that all of these services are connected with each other. If I signed up for an account on a mastodon instance, I can subscribe to your posts on Pixelfed, and vice versa. If I want to get notified about your videos on PeerTube, I can just go ahead and follow your account and comment on your videos.</p><blockquote><p>"This all sounds great, but why should I bother?"</p></blockquote><p>Let me give you 6 reasons why the fediverse is far superior to all other social media platforms out there, and why you should consider signing up for an account on one of the many instances of the fediverse.</p><h2>Reason 1: It's decentralized</h2><p>Regular social media platforms like Facebook have a <strong>single point of failure</strong>. If their servers go down, your content goes down with it. Content on the fediverse on the other hand is scattered around many instances, which means it is very resilient. If your instance dies, you can move to a new instance. This goes hand in hand with the next reason.</p><h2>Reason 2: It can't be censored</h2><p>You probably heard that the Twitter-account of Donald Trump recently got compromised by the owners of the platform. I don't want to engage in any political discussions, but the main flaw with this is the violation of <strong>freedom of speech</strong>. Even if everything someone says is controversial nonsense, it is still in his good right to express his thoughts.</p><p>On the fediverse, a scenario like this would certainly not happen, given its decentralized nature. Some instances still moderate their content, meaning that if someone posts inappropriate content, it might get blocked. The twist here is, if that person disagrees with the rules of the instance, he is free to join another instance.</p><h2>Reason 3: Free as in freedom</h2><p>There's this saying, criticizing modern software projects:</p><blockquote><p>"If it's free, you're the product"</p></blockquote><p>This is not true in all cases. "Free" can be understood in two ways.</p><p><strong>"Free as in beer"</strong> means that something might seem free at first glance (E.g. Free beer at Oktoberfest), but in the end you often leave with less than you came with. In the case of beer, you often buy another beer after the first free one. Therefore, even though you think you've saved the money for one beer, in reality bought an extra beer. In the case of proprietary software, it's a similar story. While you think that a service is free, you give up your privacy and get monetized with ads.</p><p><strong>"Free as in freedom"</strong> on the other hand means that you won't get "screwed over" like this. Most, if not all of the software for the fediverse is <strong>free and open source software</strong> (FOSS). If you don't like how a certain feature works, <strong>you are completely free to change it</strong>. You can look at the source code and propose changes to the main project, or launch your own spin of that product.</p><p>Since everyone can openly look at the source code, it is <strong>audited</strong> by many people, including security experts. This vastly improves the security and stability of the product. If the developers would do shady things, they will most certainly get called out by people, as soon as that code enters the main repositories. Proprietary (closed sourced) platforms like Facebook and Twitter can not be audited. The owners can do whatever they want, including spying on their users, or collect and sell the data of their users.</p><h2>Reason 4: It respects your privacy</h2><p>Since the software on the fediverse is audited by a lot of people, you can be almost 100% certain that joining an instance will not collect any of your personal data. If you are still concerned about your privacy though, you can still be part of the network by launching your own instance, with your own rules. There are tutorials out there, explaining how you can set up a small instance for a very cheap price on your local network.</p><h2>Reason 5: It's all about the community</h2><p>I used to spend a lot of time on "regular" social media platforms. From personal experiences, these platforms are all about promoting yourself and building up your follower count. Connecting with your friends is of little importance. In the eye of some people, you are not worthy to talk to if the amount of followers or likes-per-post didn't exceed a certain threshold.</p><p>It has now been about 5 months since I created <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">my mastodon account</a>. Talking to people on the fediverse is a completely different experience compared to Facebook or Twitter. Almost everyone I talked to is a polite, grounded person, willing to engage in constructive and fun discussions. I met many people who disagree with my views, but instead of leaving a comment saying that this post sucks, all of them took the time to express their alternative opinions. Every member of the fediverse wants to drive the network forward, which is reflected in their posts.</p><h2>Reason 6: There's an instance for everyone</h2><p>Whether you're into Gaming, Painting, or Spanish dancing music, there is an instance for you. If it isn't, you are free to create one and promote it to people of that niche. You won't loose the social aspect by launching your own instance, since you are still available to other people on the network. If you just want to get started with the fediverse, I recommend that you check out one of the many <a href="https://instances.social/">lists of mastodon instances</a>. If you like instagram and want to stay in a familiar environment, take a look at <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>, and join an instance from the list they provide.</p><p>I myself am a person who cares a lot about free and open source software, therefore my choice of instance was <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, a mastodon instance geared towards awesome like-minded people.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post has generated some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25820646">Hacker News</a>.</p><p>This is post 005 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, consider<!-- --> <a href="https://donate.slashdev.space/">buying me a coffee</a>!

<p><em>If you’d like to get an Amiga Parceiro for yourself, I explain how you can pre-order one at a heavily discounted rate at the end of the video and this article.</em></p><p>


A couple of years ago I made some videos where I showed my favorite Amiga 1000 setup at that time. It had two main hardware super powers that made it my daily driver. </p><p>

First, a fly-by of a glorious <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmW6LEwgruE">Rejuvenator board</a>, designed by the late Greg Tibbs out of Ohio (RIP Greg). A local good friend of mine here in Seattle named Christian Stich helped me upgrade that board to utilize a rare A3000 Agnus I found that can use 2MB of Chip RAM, which he custom built adapters for it to use. It also has a Kickstart 1.3 ROM chip to accelerate the boot up process and lose the typical Kickstart floppy. </p><div>

<p><em>Christian here is removing the old DRAMs, which were eight 256Kx4 in DIP format. He then installed four custom 1Mx4 in SOJ format  DRAMs with an adapter board that converts them to DIP format.</em></p><p>


The second thing was a hardware combo where I used a Microbotics Starboard expansion made back in 1987 that provided both extra fast RAM (in this case 1Mb), a real-time clock, and a SCSI module called the <a href="https://youtu.be/6BLXxY7FG5M">StarDrive which allowed me to use an Iomega SCSI Zip</a> as an external 100 MB hard drive. It used a custom Workbench boot disk that would pass control from the floppy over to the Zip drive and essentially turn the Zip into a semi-autobooting hard drive, which was a total game changer for that system. For all intents and purposes, that Amiga 1000 became one of my favorite, most treasured systems in my entire Amiga collection. </p><p>

<strong>A1000 equipped Starboard with SCSI Zip 100 as a hard drive </strong></p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BLXxY7FG5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today, as I made the difficult decision to <em>remove</em> the Starboard and Zip drive and replace it with a brand new device called the <strong>Amiga Parceiro</strong>. (Parceiro in Portuguese means “partner”.) So it’s the Friend Partner. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"></p><p>

The Amiga Parceiro was invented over the course of the past year by an Amiga hobbyist named David Dunklee who resides in a small town outside of Colorado Springs, CO. </p><p>

As Dunklee puts it:</p><div>

<p>
Fun Trivia: Mr Dunklee, now retired, was the CIO of the <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/">United States Space Force</a>, as well as an Air Force base commander. You heard that right, Number One. </p><p>


So let’s take a look at Mr. Dunklee’s new device for the Amiga 1000 and see what it can do. </p><p>

At a high level, the Parceiro can do everything my Starboard &amp; Zip combo could do except in a very tidy, modern package. And it can do it all faster and better. </p><div>

<p>
The Parceiro (sounds like par-say-ro) attaches to the side expansion port of the Amiga and is about the size of a harmonica that’s been run over by a steam roller as it’s only about 1/3 of an inch thick.</p><p>

It provides the following features: </p><ol><li> 8MB of Autoconfig Fast RAM. It is a single 8MB of SRAM versus DRAM, so it really and truly is indeed fast with zero wait states.</li> 
<li> Coin-cell battery backed Real Time Clock (RTC), which comes with its own clock software that gets put into your startup sequence.</li>
<li> SD Card Reader with 2GB MicroSD. It comes pre-formatted with the FAT32  file system and is readable on any PC as a result. This way you can quickly set up your new SD-based hard drive.</li></ol> <p>

It’s worth mentioning that this is running on period correct Amiga OS 1.3, too. </p><div>

<p>
Possibly the best unseen feature is the silkscreen prints Dunklee put around the various chips and resistors on the board. It’s a complete sci-fi treasure trove of labelling, from Back to the Future to Battlestar Galactica. </p><div>

For his fantastic creativity on the silkscreen, I half-jokingly suggested to Mr. Dunklee a future 3D printed case in clear acrylic so I could totally nerd out with his hilarious labels. And I think he might actually take me up on that idea some day! </p><div>

The Parceiro comes with instructions for creating your own KickWork disk to quickly boot up your machine and install all of the necessary software to run the device. This includes the necessary updates to your Mountlist, Startup-Sequence, adding fat95 drivers as well as the sd.device drivers. </p><p>

The <a href="https://amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=312">KickWork disk idea</a> is based off a product developed in 1988 by Mr. Rudolph Loew (RIP). This is where a Kickstart disk is combined with a stripped down Workbench disk for faster machine boot ups off a single floppy rather than 2. </p><p>

With the Parceiro, Dunklee provides six pages of detailed instructions for getting you up and running in no time. The idea here is the modified KickWork (or Workbench) disk will begin the machine’s boot up process like normal then hand over total control to the SD card like a full-fledged autobooting hard drive. It’s not 100% autobooting, but it’s pretty danged close. And once the machine fully boots you just pop out the boot floppy disk and set it to the side. Mr Dunklee confided with me that in a distant hardware update he might take the next logical step and integrate an FPGA for a true autobooting experience. </p><p>

Since my machine is equipped with a Rejuvenator board, I didn’t need a KickWork disk. So I made a customized Workbench boot disk making the necessary adjustments following Mr Dunklee’s instructions for the RTC software, the SD card device driver and adding the FAT file system library. </p><p>

In the Amiga world, this is about as close to plug-and-play for a device with this many features that I’ve ever come across that doesn’t completely take over your machine and its identity like a Vampire, or some might argue even the ACA500+ (which basically uses the A1000's power to mostly take over). The Parceiro installation was absolutely seamless and I got it up and running without a hitch. </p><p>

Now some of you might be wondering how long it takes to boot this 2GB equipped Amiga. For example, on my Amiga 2000 I have a 40 MB mechanical boot drive, but I also have a SCSI2SD card with 2GB MicroSD for all of my software and data storage. When that machine boots it can sit on a gray screen for about 20 -25 seconds while the large drive is being validated. Once that process is done the A2K snaps to life and I’m on my way. </p><p>

With the Parceiro it’s a very different - and better - experience than I’m used to. The Parceiro still needs to validate the empty space on the drive, but instead it does it in the background. So the Amiga 1000 boots up without that normal long pause. While the background validation is going on, the volume is set to READ ONLY. I can still run programs but I simply can’t write to the drive while the validation is going on. To be honest I wouldn’t even know about this had it not been noted in the instructions, as I’m virtually never writing to the drive the moment I boot it up. And within a few seconds the little Cylon red LED light stops flickering and I know then it’s job is complete (which didn’t directly affect me anyway). </p><p>

Very, very cool! </p><p>

Now, this device is currently in extremely short supply. In fact, I happened to get S/N #1 and I know S/N #2 was sold a few hours after I got mine. At that stage the inventory was sold out. But several more will eventually get made over time so if you’re an Amiga 1000 fan that means you're patient by default. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"> I’d highly recommend you keep this on your radar and try to snag one of them for yourself. It’s simply bad ass and it didn’t require me to upgrade my OS beyond adding new drivers - or really change anything - like a lot of modern upgrades often do.  </p><p>

The Parceiro is a fantastic device, made in the USA, and is a very worthy successor to the Microbotics and Supra offerings from BITD. It is one of the few modern devices that is 100% designed for the Amiga 1000 for a change. And how cool and refreshing is that? </p><p>


<strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><p>

If you’d like to pre-order one of these little technological marvels for yourself at a nearly <strong>20% discounted rate at $195</strong>, simply email <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31705c5856501f615043525458435e715e44455d5e5e5a1f525e5c"><span data-cfemail="85c4e8ece2e4abd5e4f7e6e0ecf7eac5eaf0f1e9eaeaeeabe6eae8">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to declare your interest <strong>and mention AmigaLove sent you</strong>. You will still need to cover expenses for shipping, of course, but you’ll get in line for your very own Parceiro. David Dunklee will manage the rest from there!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The underlying infrastructure of modern networked computing—namely Unix and its derivatives—is approaching fifty years of age.  What will come to replace it?  A strong competitor is the clean-slate “operating function” approach of Urbit.  Jocosely branded as “computing for Martians,” Urbit provides a fresh and updated vision of what Internet computing could come to look like in future years.  Featuring end-to-end encryption and true peer-to-peer routing built on a network-first operating system, Urbit fosters decentralized digital societies and stable user identities.</p>

<p>Our primary objectives in this course are for you to be able to explain and navigate the technical layout of Urbit, as well as construct novel applications for Arvo, the Urbit operating function, using the Hoon programming language.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the schematics and technical implementation of the Urbit OS kernel (Arvo and vanes).</li>
  <li>Navigate and utilize the Urbit ID public-key infrastructure (Azimuth).</li>
  <li>Program literately using the Hoon language, including source code conventions and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Construct userspace apps to run on the Urbit OS platform (Gall, Landscape).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>My target audience for the course consists of graduate students and seniors in computer science and neighboring fields interested in sound computing and functional operating system design (functional-as-in-language).  The course assumes an interest in functional programming but no specific experience<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centzon_T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dchtin">.</a>  <!-- egg --></p>

<p>I wanted to share a story of a segmentation fault I helped track down this weekend. I thought the final root cause of the segfault was interesting because of how unrelated it was to the code I was trying to debug.</p>



<p>I’ve been maintaining a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank">Linux fork</a> of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source">obs-ios-camera-source</a>, which is an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> plugin that allows you to use an iPhone or iPad’s camera and microphone as a video and audio source in OBS. It works in conjunction with the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obs.camera/" target="_blank">Camera for OBS Studio</a>” app in the App Store. This kind of thing is useful for online streamers who want to use their phone’s camera instead of buying a separate camera. For those of you who don’t know, OBS is short for Open Broadcaster Software. A lot of streamers use it to handle broadcasting their stream. It allows you to capture audio and video, mix it all together, do all kinds of cool things with it, and then record the final result and/or stream it to sites such as YouTube and Twitch.</p>



<p>Getting this plugin working on Linux wasn’t really complicated, because it was already well-written without much platform-specific code. After all, the existing codebase was already operational on both macOS and Windows. It mostly just required tweaking a few compile/link options to make the code run happily on Linux.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’m pretty sure a good number of people have been using my Linux port of this plugin without issues. I know it works fine for me when I test with it in Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. I’ve helped people on other distros get it working too. I don’t really do any streaming myself — maybe someday though!</p>



<p>On Friday, GitHub user rrondeau <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" target="_blank">reported an issue</a>: after a half a year of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin working without a problem, it suddenly started causing OBS to segfault on his computer (currently running Fedora 33). He provided a stack trace that showed that the segfault was happening because of something initiated by the plugin. Afterward, he used GDB to get a better stack trace that provided more info about the functions being called and the parameters being passed:</p>

<p>The actual segfault was happening inside of a function called “socket_send” in libsamba-sockets-samba4.so, which was being called by a function in libusbmuxd, which is bundled as part of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin source code and is used for communicating with iOS devices over USB. When I first saw this in the stack trace, my mind thought “Huh…that’s weird. Why does libusbmuxd use Samba’s library for its socket code instead of providing its own?” (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.samba.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.samba.org/" target="_blank">Samba</a> is an implementation of the Windows file sharing protocol used by pretty much every Linux distribution)</p>



<p>I tested and couldn’t reproduce the issue in Ubuntu. I know basically nothing about Fedora, but I faked my way through grabbing a Fedora 33 virtual machine, installing OBS, and compiling the plugin. I ran into the exact same issue that he was seeing.</p>



<p>Before I had a chance to look deeper and understand what was going on, rrondeau beat me to the correct conclusion: code in Samba’s library was mistakenly being called. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" target="_blank">libusbmuxd has a function called socket_send</a>, but clearly <a href="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">libsamba-sockets-samba4’s function that is also named socket_send</a> was accidentally being called instead.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s all we really needed to know. Renaming libusbmuxd’s socket_send function to something else, and updating all references to it to use the new name, fixed the issue. I still wanted to understand why this suddenly became an issue when it had been working fine prior to that. Why were we calling into Samba libraries? Why does an iOS USB multiplexing library even consider talking to a library associated with Windows file sharing?</p>



<p>Not knowing the answer to that question bothered me. I decided to dig deeper and understand exactly what was going on. I started by using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" target="_blank">ldd</a>, which lists all dynamic libraries used by a program or library:</p>


<pre title="">[fedora@fedora33 build]$ ldd obs-ios-camera-source.so 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffa599a000)
	libobs.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libobs.so.0 (0x00007f0a3f688000)
	libavcodec.so.58 =&gt; /lib64/libavcodec.so.58 (0x00007f0a3e2db000)
	libavutil.so.56 =&gt; /lib64/libavutil.so.56 (0x00007f0a3e036000)
...
	libsamba-sockets-samba4.so =&gt; /usr/lib64/samba/libsamba-sockets-samba4.so (0x00007fd6af4b7000)
...
</pre>


<p>I truncated the output because it spit out a very long list of libraries. As we can see from ldd’s output, obs-ios-camera-source.so depends on libsamba-sockets-samba4.so. ldd lists all recursive dependencies as well, and I couldn’t find any references to “samba” in the plugin source code, so this was likely an indirect dependency instead. I confirmed this by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readelf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readelf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">readelf</a> to show only the direct dependencies:</p>


<pre title="">[fedora@fedora33 build]$ readelf -d obs-ios-camera-source.so | grep NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libobs.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libavcodec.so.58]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libavutil.so.56]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libobs-frontend-api.so.0]

 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
</pre>


<p>At this point I used ldd and readelf to walk through the tree of dependencies and figure out what was actually linking against the Samba libraries. I later learned that I could have installed lddtree (part of the pax-utils package) to do this automatically. Either way, this led me to discover that the Samba libraries were being included through libsmbclient, which was a dependency of libavformat (part of FFmpeg). libavformat is a dependency of libobs.</p>



<p>Repeating this experiment on Ubuntu showed that libavformat on Ubuntu does not depend on libsmbclient. This explains why I couldn’t reproduce the issue on Ubuntu. So why does Fedora’s (well, <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rpmfusion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPM Fusion</a>‘s) version of libavformat depend on libsmbclient?</p>



<p>It turns out that it’s a compile-time option for FFmpeg. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" target="_blank">libavformat contains code for talking with Windows servers using libsmbclient</a>, but it’s an optional thing that you can choose to enable at compile time. Clearly Ubuntu chooses not to enable it, but RPM Fusion does. <a href="https://lists.rpmfusion.org/archives/list/rpmfusion-commits@lists.rpmfusion.org/thread/57UYP4VFY3VCJFU3DGPHLUE3JPYP73HJ/">Actually, I found the exact post on RPM Fusion’s commits mailing list</a> where the patch was added for enabling SMB support in FFmpeg. This patch is what led to the whole issue happening. If Ubuntu’s version of FFmpeg was being built with SMB support, we would have seen this a long time ago. This commit to RPM Fusion was made on December 31, 2020, which explains why rrondeau had only recently begun seeing the problem.</p>



<p>The root cause here is that the obs-ios-camera-source plugin was linking against two libraries that both provided a function named socket_send: libsamba-sockets-samba4 (indirectly through libobs) and libusbmuxd. libusbmuxd was being linked statically, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" target="_blank">that doesn’t prevent functions in it from being resolved through dynamic linking rules anyway</a>. So even though libusbmuxd was a static library with its own internal implementation of socket_send, it was using …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-content-content"><p>Caloric restriction is the practice of taking fewer calories than total daily energy needs. Caloric restriction without malnutrition is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous species. It has been proven to reduce oxidative stress through various pathways and a growing body of evidence shows that sustained periods of caloric restriction without malnutrition improves risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders in humans. (Weindruch, 1996)</p><p>But chronic caloric restriction is difficult to sustain and newer dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have emerged as alternative approaches that still improve markers of aging. The most popular type of caloric restriction applied today is a 16:8 Time-Restricted Feeding schedule i.e. no eating for 16 hours, eat for 8 hours. While difficult for some to get started, Intermittent Fasting is generally easy to adopt and has important short and long-term health benefits such as metabolic, cardiovascular, and digestive health benefits. </p><p>Multi-day fasting is another form of fasting with a higher detoxifying effect that activates important an important cellular restoration process called autophagy. Autophagy is a super useful process that recycles, cleans up, and rids your body of damaged and misfolded proteins. When your cells are constantly fed, they aren't worried about efficiency and restoration - they're thinking that 'times are good, we don't need to work hard anymore.' In a well-fed state, your cells are only concerned with growing. Besides putting all their emphasis on growth, your well-fed cells also turn other genes off such as those related to fat metabolism, stress resistance, and damage repair. </p><p>During fasting (starvation), things are very different. We have a well-preserved starvation “program” that kicks our cell into a completely different state when food, particularly glucose or sugar, isn’t around. Your body reacts to the newfound stress by waking up cell functions to protect you and as a result, starts acting more efficiently and dynamically. This 'reactivation' of the cellular system leads to lowered inflammation, increases your brain's resistance to stress, and many other important long-term health benefits.</p><h2>So, what happens to your body on a fast?</h2><p>At Basis, we wanted to put the science to the test and really see what happens in real-time to your body when you’re following a prolonged fast. So I volunteered to be the guinea pig by spending last week doing a 3-day water fast and tracking my vitals in real-time with Basis to see the impact it has on my body.</p><p><img alt="Fasting data" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xxkgr6gh5t72/3gyIfqHoGt8Iegl8jOcKxR/2eed6467ced1c30d17ca5fd14d27fbf3/Fasting_real_time_.png"></p><p>The Basis app added an extra layer of health confidence for me because I was getting real-time glucose data from my biosensor and could identify if I was going into a hypoglycemic attack; my wearable was connected to Basis and was giving me real-time heart rate data, and I was tracking my hydration and running a once-a-day urinalysis test in Basis to confirm that I wasn’t dealing with dehydration. In Basis, I was also getting my sleep reports for each night, including a time-specific snapshot of my glucose and heart rate - something of particular interest since more than 40% of hypoglycemic events happen during sleep. </p><p>For data sharing purposes, I also did a pre- and post-fast blood panel. You can see a table with the biomarkers I tested for at the top of this post. I've also provided body composition data because I'm sure most people think of fasting for weight loss purposes. </p><p>Disclaimer: Speak with your doctor before undertaking any type of fasting with or without Basis. Your doctor will advise you if any pre-existing condition or abnormalities in your biomarkers could create complications.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s jump into the Basis real-time data along with an explanation of the cellular process that happens as you hit different intervals in your fast. </p><h3><b>DAY 1</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 75 / High 119 / Average 94 </p><p>Glucose Variability: 10.31</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 49 / High 96 / Average 62</p><br><h4><b>12 hours - Hello ketosis. </b></h4><p>In this state, your body starts to break down and burn fat. This process creates ketones which serve as an alternative energy source when glucose isn’t available. </p><br><h4><b>18 hours - Fat-burning mode.</b> </h4><p>I'm now generating significant ketones and I can now begin to measure blood ketone levels above baseline values. Under normal conditions, the concentration of ketones in your plasma ranges below 20 mg/dL but when you fast this concentration can reach 80+ mg/dL. My ketones measured at 32 mg/dL compared to 80 mg/dL for my glucose. </p><br><h4><b>24 hours - Autophagy</b></h4><p>Autophagy can only happen when your glucose stores are significantly low. In humans, that usually happens after 24 hours of fasting. (Alirezaei et al., Autophagy 2010)</p><h3><b>DAY 2</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 107 / Average 85 </p><p>Glucose variability: 9.96</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 45 / High 97 / Average 62 </p><br><h4><b>48 hours - Peak growth hormone</b> </h4><p>Growth hormone helps preserve lean muscle mass and reduces fat tissue accumulation, particularly as we age. It also appears to promote wound healing and cardiovascular health. After two days of fasting, the large number of circulating ketone bodies and the impact of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, promote increased growth hormone secretion (Hartman et al.,1992). </p><p>At this point in the fast, my glucose line is virtually flat, ranging between 75 - 85 mg/dL and I'm preserving my energy for essential activities and work. </p><h3><b>DAY 3</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 90 / Average 78 </p><p>Glucose variability: 8.27</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 50 / High 120 / Average 64 </p><br><h4><b>72 hours - Checkpoint. </b></h4><p>At the 3-day mark, I've hit a key milestone in cellular regeneration. My body has broken down old immune cells and generated new ones (Cheng et al., 2014). Getting those Covid defenses up! Interestingly, through this same mechanism, prolonged fasting for at least 72 hours has been shown to also preserve healthy white blood cell or lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing chemotherapy. </p><p>Last ketone measurement before breaking the fast. Approaching the 80 mg/dL along with a 79mg/dL glucose level measurement.  </p><br><h4><b>Bonus stage: Refeeding!</b></h4><p>The fast isn’t done until you get some food back in your body. The most important thing to remember is that you should resist the temptation to chow down on a pizza or a burger because as amazing as that may seem in the moment, and trust me the temptation is always there, after 3 days of just sipping on water, it will feel absolutely terrible afterward. Your stomach has for all-intensive purposes shrunk and hasn’t gone through the process of digesting anything for 3 days. You’ll get bad stomach cramping and spend quite a bit of time in the bathroom if you eat a carb-heavy meal. </p><p>Beyond this practical reason, it’s important to break your fast with a nutritious, balanced meal that will further enhance the all-around cell and tissue health-boosting exercise you just undertook. </p><h3><b>Looking for a clearer view of your health?</b></h3><p><a href="https://basishealth.typeform.com/to/ovy5RnER">Sign up</a> for the Basis Early Access Beta and discover what having real-time access to your health data means. </p></div></div>]]>

			<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> has stormed into software development in
recent years. While the concepts behind it are powerful and useful, similar
tools have been used in systems for decades. FreeBSD’s
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html">jails</a> in one of those tools
which build upon even older <code>chroot(2)</code> To put it shortly, with these tools, you
can make a safe environment separated from the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Jails in FreeBSD is by no means a new tool (introduced in 4.X), but for a reason
or another, I haven’t used them that often, which is a shame since they are so
powerful. So I wanted to explore this concept in a concise and summarized
manner.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>ZFS datasets are a great way of creating templates for jails since, after the
template creation, you can easily create new jails with <code>zfs clone</code> or <code>zfs send/receive</code>. Typically people tend to divide jails to complete and service
jails, where the former usually resembles a real FreeBSD system, and the latter
is often dedicated to applications/services. I’ll cover complete jails for now.</p>
<p>The creation of templates starts with creating a dataset for your jail and
template. Here I’ll make a new dataset for the base installation of FreeBSD
12.2.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/vm zroot/vm
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2
</code></pre><p>After that, fetch the base installation itself:</p>
<pre><code>$ fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/base.txz
# Fetch all the necessary stuff for your template, e.g. lib32 if needed
$ sudo tar -xJvpf base.txz -C /vm/tmpl/12.2
</code></pre><p>After that you should write a minimum viable <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> for the template:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/rc.conf
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to <code>rc.conf(5)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Start or stop services
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
syslogd_flags="-ss"
cron_flags="-J 60"
</code></pre><p>You can also disable some unnecessary jobs for jails:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/periodic.conf
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to <code>periodic.conf(5)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># No output for successful script runs.

security_status_ipfwlimit_enable="NO"
security_status_ipf6denied_enable="NO"
security_status_tcpwrap_enable="NO"
</code></pre><p>You also might want to enable ports in your jail:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /vm/tmpl/12.2/usr/ports
$ sudo mkdir -p /vm/tmpl/12.2/var/ports/{distfiles,packages}
$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/make.conf
</code></pre><pre><code>WRKDIRPREFIX = /var/ports
DISTDIR = /var/ports/distfiles
PACKAGES = /var/ports/packages
</code></pre><p>Apply system updates to the template:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo freebsd-update -b /vm/tmpl/12.2 fetch install
</code></pre><p>Lastly, take a snapshot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs snapshot zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete
</code></pre><p>This creates a snapshot of <code>zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2</code> named <code>complete</code>. You can then check your current snapshots with:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs list -t snapshot
</code></pre><h2 id="creating-jails-from-the-template">Creating Jails from the Template</h2>
<p>Now you should be able to create a new jail based on that snapshot. You can do
it either with <code>zfs clone</code> or <code>zfs send/receive</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Difference Between the Two</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the
same as the dataset from which it was created. As with snapshots, creating a
clone is nearly instantaneous and initially consumes no additional disk
space. In addition, you can snapshot a clone.” [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The zfs send command creates a stream representation of a snapshot that is
written to standard output. By default, a full stream is generated. You can
redirect the output to a file or to a different system. The zfs receive
command creates a snapshot whose contents are specified in the stream that is
provided on standard input. If a full stream is received, a new file system is
created as well. You can send ZFS snapshot data and receive ZFS snapshot data
and file systems with these commands. See the examples in the next section.”

</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs clone zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete zroot/vm/jail1

# OR

$ sudo sh -c "zfs send zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete | zfs receive zroot/vm/jail1"

<p><strong>Note</strong>: These configurations is for very bare-bones jail, e.g. without any
mounts or advanced networking. Further configurations are discussed in future posts.</p>

We will be taking a more precise look at that.</p>
<p>We will be exploring a Beginner to Expert Roadmap as designed by Tux in the infographic below
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610889439172/wAmw3SEGa.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="1603267450360.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tryhackme.com/">tryhackme.com</a> provides a wide variety of security topics you can select from. These security topics give you access to different vulnerable machines and they are to be scanned and exploited with different tools for you to be able to complete the given tasks. Although there are certain aspects where you would require premium access, most of it is free. Every learning path comes with a different cybersecurity topic and they are very crucial to understand various concepts. TryHackMe Network can be connected to via OpenVPN in order to deploy machines / various Operating systems and carry out exploits.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://immersivelabs.online/">immersivelabs.online</a> is a gamified learning lab that is developed by experts as an emulation of world-class security threats. It allows you to visualize your capabilities as Hacker, practice with the latest discovered security threats, and earn points for completing labs.
It has over 600labs, and it's one of the coolest places to hon your skills</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">hackthebox.eu</a> is very much hard than the previous two because you can't sign up directly, you have to hack your way into the platform. It is focused on practicing your skills and it comes with a Social Network feeling as you can connect with millions of hackers on the platform, share ideas, methodologies, and even compete for the Leaderboards. But It also has an Academy, if you need to review your knowledge or learn new concepts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub.com</a> provides materials allowing anyone to gain practical hands-on experience with digital security, computer applications, and network administration tasks. VulnHub offers offline virtual machines, allowing users to practice without competing with other learners. There’s no need to worry about consistent internet access, high pings, or latency. Users can set up their own private labs to practice and learn new skills.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course">PEH by tcm</a> is a 25 hours course by TCM Security, it is one of the best-paid courses you can ever get. It is recommended to have a hackthebox account before starting the course. They focus only on tools and topics that will make you successful as an ethical hacker, it is completely hands-on and covers all foundational topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="certification">Certification</h2>
<p>Once you have quite an experience in all of the above, you can decide to test your credibility and prepare for employment by getting the certifications, We will discuss below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/"> eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration
</a> is designed for students with no penetration testing experience, as shown in course content, the instructor’s mode of teaching, and the lab modules. The course teaches about practical skill-sets that are important to penetration testing such as networking knowledge, scripting/programming, vulnerability identification, etc. It has a fairly great structure and is delivered in the easiest way to understand. Although you can proceed to the certification without the course, it is still very recommended you take the course.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/OSCP/">Offensive Security Certified Professional</a>  is an ethical hacking certification offered by Offensive Security that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools included with the Kali Linux distribution (successor of BackTrack). The OSCP is a hands-on penetration testing certification, requiring holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecpptv2-certification/">eLearnSecurity’s Certified Professional Penetration Tester</a>  is a comprehensive, “black box” engagement against a given scope. You have seven days to complete the engagement, and another seven days to complete a professional penetration test report. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/courses-and-certifications/">Offensive Security Certified Expert</a>  is a 48-hour lab examination that will thoroughly test you on web exploitation, Windows exploit development, anti-virus evasion, x86 assembly, handcrafting shellcode, and more</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/">Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)</a>  is a qualification obtained by demonstrating knowledge of assessing the security of computer systems by looking for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems, using the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cyber Security is one of the most expensive fields, You are required to do a number of exams and certification. Unlike Software Development, These certifications are very crucial, They are more or less like a "Get out of jail free" Card.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming this far with me, I might be writing soon on preparatory exams for the above certifications</p>

		<p>I’ve written before about predatory scientific journals: those fly-by-night venues that will publish nearly any submitted paper, however dreadful. Their motive is to get the thousands of dollars in “publication fees” that authors are forced to pay. In return, the authors get to cite their paper on their c.v.s, even though most papers in these journals are worthless. (Those who evaluate c.v.s, however, often don’t know which journals are bogus.)</p>
<p><a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/04/16/hoax-a-crazy-hilarious-paper-in-a-predatory-journal/">In April of last year</a> I wrote about a hilarious and deliberately insane paper written by Daniel Baldassare, “What’s the deal with birds?”, published in the predatory <em>Scientific Journal of Research and Reviews</em> (it’s not there any longer).&nbsp; Its thesis, such as it was, was that birds tending to look like fish (i.e., penguins) occurred in areas most susceptible to climate change, while birds with weird beaks (i.e;, parrots), didn’t live in those areas. But it was a farrago of madness and humor, done on purpose to show that these journals will publish anything. Here are the “data” from Baldassare’s paper:</p>

<p>I guess after Baldassare exposed both the paper and the journal <a href="https://twitter.com/evornithology/status/1245817707024592898">in his Twitter thread</a>, they decided to remove the paper. Baldassare, by the way, managed to bargain the “author’s fee” down from $1700 to zero. <em><a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/whats-deal-birds-new-paper-ask">Audubon Magazine</a></em> even wrote a piece about the hoax.</p>
<p>Now we have another of these hoax papers, also dealing with “fishy” birds. <a href="https://juniperpublishers.com/ofoaj/">This one</a>, published by Martin Stervander and Danny Haelewaters, appears in&nbsp;in <em>Oceanography &amp; Fisheries. </em>It’s&nbsp;still up (click on the screenshot), but won’t be for long (I have a pdf for you if it’s taken down).</p>

<p>The premise and thesis is also bull-goose loony, again on purpose. This time their complex hypothesis took into account no fewer than four biological factors. Here’s how the authors describe the genesis of the hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time we developed the original idea about fishiness of birds potentially being correlated to absence of poisonous mushrooms, one of the authors (D.H.) was eating pizza with four cheeses, chicken, anchovies, and mushrooms. It was really a good one, and this prompted us to—just like the pizza—integrate all four parameters in this study: fishiness, birdiness, lack of fungal toxicity, and effects of prolonged heating. We note that integrative taxonomy approaches [8], and by extension approaches to integrate everything in research, are being increasingly employed, thus supporting the rationale for the work presented in this paper.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that research has not always been this integrative, or cross-disciplinary. For example, Charles Darwin worked alone [9] and still published a relatively well-cited contribution to the field of theology and some other disciplines. We feel it is natural for humans to dangle up and down between extremes. This is true for scientists, just like it is for politicians (consider the formation of the European Union in the 1990s and early 2000s versus the current wish of some countries to leave again [10]).</p>
<p>All in all, in this study we present the results of our work with fishy birds (<i>fide Baldassarre</i>&nbsp;[1]). We hypothesize that, (1) despite climate change, it is still cold in Antarctica and thus the presumed lack of poisonous fungi leads to fishy-looking birds. Further, with a clear correlation of pizza and lower latitudes [11], we hypothesize that (2) birdy-looking birds (as well as fishy-looking fish) will be more prevalent than fishy-looking birds on pizzas.</p>

<p>Any good reviewer would have spotted this in an instant as a Poe, but of course these journals don’t care about quality, or even seriousness. I doubt the reviewers even read the papers.</p>
<p>Their results, like Baldassari’s are presented in a single bizarre figure, with lots of bogus statements in the text about statistical methods and significance. But what they conclude is that birds that look like fish (i.e., penguins) tend to occur in areas without poisonous fungi (Antarctica), while birds that don’t look like fish (chickens, swifts, etc; they also threw in a flying fish that looks like a swift, an anchovy, and a “Nemo fish”) live at lower latitudes where there’s an abundance of pizza. A remarkable vindication of their thesis! The results in graphic form:</p>

<p>. . .&nbsp; and in the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our PCA revealed that most of the variation in the dataset was partitioned along the first (59.3%) and second (34.8%) principal components (PCs), with loadings corresponding to poisonous funginess and pizza toppingness, respectively (Table 1). There is a clear bimodality in both PC scores, distinguishing on the one hand penguins (PC1, low funginess) and on the other hand anchovy and chicken (PC2, high toppingness). Plotting the scores for all taxa, a quadratic model explains the two-dimensional distribution of avian species (p &lt;&lt;&lt; 0.05) with low residual variation except for the outlier&nbsp;<i>H. rustica</i>&nbsp;(Figure 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They note that while fishy-looking birds occur in areas lacking poisonous fungi&nbsp;<em>and</em> pizza, that relationship doesn’t hold for birdy-looking fish (flying fish).&nbsp; They also note that the swallow is an outlier.</p>
<p>In the discussion they take up the parlous subject of climate change, and postulate that, with global warming, poisonous fungi may invade Antarctica and “may thus exert a strong selection pressure on penguins to evolve a less fishy morphology,” so that the evolved penguins may, with their new appearance, expand into “pizza topping habitats.”</p>
<p>There are two more immediate clues that this was a hoax: the acknowledgements (which damn predatory journals!) and the author contributions, which cite Darwin:</p>

<p>First author Martin Stervander also wrote <a href="https://www.stervander.com/fishy-birds-birdy-fish-poisonous-fungi-and-pizza-our-scientific-breakthroughs-published-in-predatory-journal/">an exposé on his own website</a> about the paper, including a positive “review” of the paper for another journal where it was submitted, <em>Journal of Ecosystems and Ecography</em>, published by OMICS International. It’s clear that the reviewing process of all these journals is deficient—to say the least. But if it was rigorous, they’d have no way to make money!</p>

<p>So we have another exposé of&nbsp; predatory journals, which we all know exist because every scientist gets daily requests for submissions to these journals, even when the journals aren’t remotely connected with the scientist’s research. (I’ve had pleas for my papers from journals in obstetrics and gynecology.) But there’s no better way to expose this nonsense than to publish a loony paper in it.&nbsp; Sadly, this doesn’t bring down the journals (they just remove the papers), and they continue to serve as citations for desperate scientists.</p>
<p>Is there anything unethical about these hoaxes? Hell, no: there’s no way anybody could be deceived by papers like these, and it’s the best way to show the journals up for what they are.</p>
<p>They also resemble the “hoax papers” sent by Boghossian, Pluckrose, and Lindsay to social-science journals in the famous “grievance studies affair” that now has<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair"> its own <em>Wikipedia</em> page</a>. As I wrote last April:</p>
<blockquote><p>One final remark. In the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair">grievance studies affair</a>“, Helen Pluckrose, James Lindsay, and especially Peter Boghossian got into big trouble for “hoaxing” humanities journals with equally ludicrous papers.&nbsp; Baldassarre won’t get into trouble (and shouldn’t), for his paper is in a clearly predatory journal.&nbsp; But what’s the difference between a predatory scientific journal that will publish nonsense and humanities journals like&nbsp;<em>Fat Studies</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Gender, Place &amp; Culture</em>&nbsp;that publish nonsense but also purport to be venues for serious research? In effect, they both do the same thing: help researchers fatten their c.v.s with worthless research. Why should Boghossian et al. be excoriated for exposing the same kind of crappy journal standards that Baldassarre did?</p>
<p><em>Anything</em>&nbsp;that exposes this kind of academic garbage, including clear hoax papers, is to be applauded, so long as the hoaxes are revealed (as they were with the Grievance Studies Trio) or are so palpably ridiculous (as with Baldassarre’s paper) that they couldn’t be anything&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;than a hoax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

            <h2>Centralized silos are never the solution</h2>
            <p>Signal is possibly the most recommended pro-privacy instant
communication app — one that was commonplace in the hacker community,
and has now gained a lot of mainstream traction, thanks to WhatsApp
deciding to screw its userbase over. It certainly presents a more
compelling alternative than others in the same space, like WhatsApp
itself, Telegram, etc. They engineered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" rel="nofollow">Signal
Protocol</a>, which has
found its way into other messaging systems, and has been the base for
the likes of OMEMO and Matrix.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> While I admire the tech behind
Signal, I still believe we can do better, and we ought to.</p>

<p>I have a few gripes with Signal — the biggest of them all is it’s
centralized, and in the US no less. This alone makes it not that
different from WhatsApp — we’re simply moving from one silo to another.
What’s to say that Signal will uphold its values, continue operating
<em>and</em> evade censorship and potential compromise? To top it off, they’re
becoming a fairly high value target off late. And if that isn’t
convincing enough, Signal’s massive outage lasting nearly a day<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
should be enough evidence against centralization. Further, Signal is
known to use AWS<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> as their cloud provider — what if another
Parler<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> happens and the rug is pulled from under Signal’s feet?</p>

<p>A common defense in favor of Signal is, “But it’s all open source!”.
Sure is, but on what basis do I trust them? I don’t mean to sound
conspiratorial, but what’s to say that the server in production hasn’t
been backdoored? In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server" rel="nofollow">Signal server
code</a> hasn’t even been
updated since April 2020. You’re telling me it’s undergone <em>no</em> changes?</p>

<p>Another response I usually see is “But Signal is all we have!”. While
that is somewhat true — at least by the metric of “secure messengers
your granny can use”, there are some promising alternatives who are
especially focused on decentralizing E2EE communications.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a>: Matrix has improved a whole lot, and I
like that they’re working to disprove that end-to-end encryption
cannot be decentralized<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</li>
<li><a href="https://getsession.org/" rel="nofollow">Session</a>: While it involves some cryptoshit,
and hasn’t been verified yet, it’s an interesting alternative to keep
an eye out for.</li>
</ol>

<p>All things said, Signal is the shiniest turd we have — it fits most
threat models, and does the job alright; I will continue to use it.
However, here’s something to think about: while privacy preserving tech
is commendable, does it have to come at the cost of user freedoms? Hint:
it doesn’t, and it shouldn’t.</p>

<p><em>NB</em>: This is a repost on this blog of a post made on <a href="https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=2192">nixers.net</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-distribution">What is a distribution</h2>

<p>What are software distributions? You may think you know everything there
is to know about the term software distribution, but take a moment to
think about it, take a step back and try to see the big picture.</p>

<p>We often have in mind the thousands of Linux distributions when we hear
it, however, this is far from limited to Linux, BSD, Berkeley Software
Distribution, has software distribution right in the name. Android,
and iOS are software distributions too.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s so prevalent, we may have stopped paying attention to
the concept. We find it hard to put a definition together.<br>
There’s definitely the part about distributing software in it. Software
that may be commercial or not, open source or not.<br>
To understand it better maybe investigating what problems software
distributions address would clear things up.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine a world before software distributions, does that world
exist? A world where software stays within boundaries, not shared with anyone
outside.<br>
Once we break these boundaries, and we want to share it, we’ll find that we
have to package all the software together meaningfully, configure
them so that they work well together, adding some glue in between when
necessary, find the appropriate medium to distribute the bundle, get
it all from one end to another safely, make sure it installs properly,
and follow up on it.</p>

<p>Thus, software distribution is about the mechanism and the community
that takes the burden and decisions to build an assemblage of coherent
software that can be shipped.</p>

<p>The operating system, or kernel if you like, could be, and is often,
part of the collage offered, a software just like others.</p>

<p>The people behind it are called distribution maintainers, or package
maintainers. Their role vary widely, they could write the software that
stores all the packages called the repository, maintain a package manager
with its format, maintain a full operating system installer, package and
upload software they built or that someone else built on a specific time
frame/life cycle, make sure there aren’t any malicious code uploaded on
the repository, follow up on the latest security issues and bug reports,
fix third party software to fit the distribution philosophical choices
and configurations, and most importantly test, plan, and make sure
everything holds up together.<br>
These maintainers are the source of trust of the distribution, they
take responsibility for it. In fact, I think it’s more accurate to call
them distributors.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="different-ways-to-approach-it">Different ways to approach it</h2>

<p>There’s so many distributions it can make your head spin. The software
world is booming, especially the open source one. For instance, we can
find bifurcations of distributions that get copied by new maintainers
and divert. This creates a tree like aspect, a genealogy of both common
ancestors and/or influences in technical and philosophical choices.<br>
Overall, we now have a vibrant ecosystem where a thing learned on a
branch can help a completely unrelated leaf on another tree. There’s
something for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="target-and-speciality">Target and speciality</h3>

<p>So what could be so different between all those software distributions,
why not have a single platform that everyone can build on.</p>

<p>One thing is specialization and differentiation. Each distro caters to
a different audience and is built by a community with its philosophy.</p>

<p>Let’s go over some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A distribution can support specific sets and combinations of hardware:
from CPU ISA to peripherals drivers</li>
  <li>A distribution may be specifically optimized for a type of environment:
Be it desktop, portable mobile device, servers, warehouse size computers,
embedded devices, virtualised environment, etc.</li>
  <li>A distribution can be commercially backed or not</li>
  <li>A distribution can be designed for different levels of knowledge in a
domain, professional or not. For instance, security research, scientific
computing, music production, multimedia box, HUD in cars, mobile device
interface, etc.</li>
  <li>A distribution might have been certified to follow certain standards
that need to be adhered to in professional settings, for example security
standards and hardening</li>
  <li>A distribution may have a single purpose in a commodity machine,
specific machine functionalities such as firewall, a computer cluster,
a router, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>That all comes to the raison d’être, the philosophy of the distribution,
it guides every decision the maintainers have to make. It guides how they
configure every software, how they think about security, portability,
comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>For example, if a distribution cares about free software, it’s going to
be strict about what software it includes and what licenses it allows
in its repository, having software to check the consistency of licenses
in the core.<br>
Another example is if their goal is to target a desktop audience then
internationalization, ease of use, user-friendliness, numerous
packages, is going to be prioritized. While, again, if the
target is a real time embedded device, the size of the kernel is going
to be small, configured and optimized for this purpose, and limiting and
choosing the appropriate packages that work in this environment. Or if
it’s targeted at advanced users that love having control of their machine,
the maintainers will choose to let the users make most of the decisions,
providing as many packages as possible with the latest version possible,
with a loose way to install the distribution, having a lot of libraries
and software development tools.</p>

<p>What this means is that a distribution does anything it can to provide
sane defaults that fit its mindset. It composes and configures a layer
of components, a stack of software.</p>

<h3 id="the-layering">The layering</h3>

<p>Distribution maintainers often have at their disposition different blocks
and the ability to choose them, stacking them to create a unit we call a
software distribution. There’s a range of approaches to this, they could
choose to have more, or less, included in what they consider the <em>core</em> of
the distribution and what is externally less important to it.<br>
Moreover, sometimes they might even leave the core very small and loose,
instead providing the glue software that makes it easy for the users
to choose and swap the blocks at specific stages in time: installation,
run time, maintenance mode, etc.</p>

<p>So what are those blocks of interdependent components.</p>

<p>The first part is the method of installation, this is what everything
hinges on, the starting point.</p>

<p>The second part is the kernel, the real core of all operating systems
today. But that doesn’t mean that the distribution has to enforce
it. Some distributions may go as far as to provide multiple kernels
specialised in different things or none at all.</p>

<p>The third part is the filesystem and file hierarchy, the component that
manages where and how files are spread out on the physical or virtual
hardware. This could be a mix and match where sections of the file system
tree are stored on separate filesystems.</p>

<p>The fourth part is the init system, PID 1. This choice has generated
a lot of contention these days. PID 1 being the mother process of all
other processes on the system. What role it has and what functionalities
it should include is a subject of debate.</p>

<p>The fifth part is composed of the shell utilities, what we sometimes
refer to as the userland or user space, as it’s the first layer the user
can directly interface with to have control of the operating system, the
place where processes run. The userland implementations on Unix-based
systems usually tries to follow the POSIX standard. There are many such
implementations, also subject of contention.</p>

<p>The sixth part is made up of services and their management. The daemons,
long-running processes that keep the system in order. Many argue if the
management functionality should be part of the init system or not.</p>

<p>The seventh part is documentation. Often it is forgotten but it is still
very important.</p>

<p>The last part is about everything else, all the user interfaces and
utilities a user can have and ways to manage them on the system.</p>

<h3 id="stable-releases-vs-rolling">Stable releases vs Rolling</h3>

<p>There exists a spectrum on which distributions place themselves when
it comes to keeping up to date with the versions of the software they
provide. This most often applies to external third party open source
software.<br>
The spectrum is the following: Do we allow the users to always have the
latest version of every software while running the risk of accidentally
breaking their system, what we call bleeding edge or rolling distro, or
do we take a more conservative approach and take the time to test every
software properly before allowing it in the repository, while not having
all the latest updates, features, and optimizations of the software,
what we call release based distro.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: Keep in mind that this isn’t about the software version from the
developer’s perspective but the upstream/packaged software version from
the maintainers’ perspective. The distinction lies in the selection that
package maintainers make: will their upstream changes directly affect
all users and changes “roll” downstream, or are users able to select
between multiple upstreams sources/releases. We take the eyes of the
maintainers here.</p>

<p>The extreme of the first scenario would be to let users directly download
from the software vendor/creator source code repository, or the opposite,
let the software vendor/creator push directly to the distribution
repository. Which could easily break or conflict with the user’s system
or lead to security vulnerability. …</p></article></div></div>

<p>Send a tweet with a short BASIC program to <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleIIBot">@AppleIIBot</a> and your program will run on an emulated Apple II computer. The bot will tweet you back with a video your program’s output!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p id="block-6d1426fc-dbf0-4f3b-8e79-3976ce3135a7">The bot accepts programs in AppleSoft BASIC, the version of BASIC that was included with the Apple II computer. The first version of BASIC (Beginners’ All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was released in 1964. AppleSoft BASIC, released in 1978, added commands for using the Apple II’s graphics capabilities and other features. </p>



<p>To send your program to the bot, just start your code after @AppleIIBot. Don’t forget to hit RETURN before each new line of code.</p>



<p>You need to use (at least one) line number. Immediate mode is not supported. Don’t add RUN to the end, the bot takes care of that.</p>



<p><strong>Caveats, Warnings, and Disclaimers</strong></p>



<ul><li>If the BASIC parser can’t understand something about your program (for instance, if you forget to include line numbers) it simply won’t respond. On a real Apple II, BASIC would tell you if something was amiss. On Twitter, it really isn’t feasible. So if you don’t get a reply within three or four minutes, check your code a try again. Or ask for help — it is Twitter, after all.</li><li>The bot doesn’t support sound yet.</li></ul>



<p>You can learn the fundamentals of AppleSoft BASIC with Apple’s book <a href="https://archive.org/details/ATouchOfApplesoftBASIC/">A Touch Of Applesoft BASIC</a>. More experienced programmers who need a refresher might want to reference the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Applesoft_BASIC_Programming_Reference_Manual_Apple_Computer">Applesoft BASIC Reference Manual</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Bracket Directives</strong></p>



<p>By default, the bot starts running your program, lets it run for 3 seconds before starting to record the video. It records the video for 30 seconds. If you don’t like this standard recording behavior — for instance, if your program takes a long time to draw a fractal — you can change it with a directive at the start of your tweet.</p>



<p>The B directive tells the bot how many seconds to wait before Beginning to record. {B20} will let your program run for 20 seconds before recording begins. {B0} will start recording immediately. The maximum wait is currently 99 seconds.</p>



<p>The S directive tells the bot how many Seconds to record your program running. {S2} will will record it running for just 2 seconds. {S99} will record it for the maximum 99 seconds. If you’re going to tie up the bot for that long, make it good. </p>



<p>The {G} directive gives you an authentic, old-school green screen. The {A} directive gives you an authentic, old-school amber screen. Who needs all those fancy colors?</p>



<p>You can combine directives in one set of brackets, like this: {B30S25} or {GS5B5}</p>



<p>Direct questions about the bot to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/kaysavetz">Kay Savetz</a>.</p>

experiences with the Rust programming language. More profoundly, he
explored a facet of software that is oftentimes overlooked: the <em>values</em> of
the software we use. To paraphrase him slightly:</p><blockquote><p><em>Values</em> are defined as <em>expressions of relative importance</em>. Two things that
we’re comparing could both be good attributes. The real question is, when
you have to make a choice between two of them, what do you choose? That
choice that you make, reflects your core values.</p></blockquote><p>He goes ahead to contrast the core values of some programming languages with
the core values we demand from systems software, like operating system
kernels, file systems, microprocessors, and so on. It is a really good talk
and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">watch it</a>.</p><blockquote><p>It is important to think about values because they are <em>core to the
decisions that we make</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike systems software, the values demanded from text editors or IDEs vary
greatly depending on who you ask. These are much more personal tools and
make room for a diverse set of desires.</p><p>The following listing enumerates values that could be attributed to
development tools.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Value</th><th>Commentary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Approachability</strong></td><td>Ease of getting started with for typical tasks, and contribution friendliness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Doing one thing well</strong></td><td>Unix philosophy, fitting into an ecosystem</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Editing efficiency</strong></td><td>Fewer interactions, mnemonics, composable keystrokes, etc.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Extensibility</strong></td><td>The degree to which behavior and appearance can be changed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Freedom</strong></td><td>Embraces <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free</a> software, rejects proprietary software</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Integration</strong></td><td>Cohesive core and concerted third-party functionality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Introspectability</strong></td><td>Capable of being understood and inspected ad-hoc</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Keyboard centrism</strong></td><td>Focus on keyboard interactions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maintainability</strong></td><td>The degree to which it can be modified without introducing faults</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Progressiveness</strong></td><td>A measure of eagerness to make progress and leverage modern technology</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stability</strong></td><td>Things that worked before continue to work the same way</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text centrism</strong></td><td>Text as a universal interface</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Velocity</strong></td><td>Short and focused release cycles, aligned personpower, leveraging the community effectively</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>Before we go any further, I'd like to point that out if you care about
any of the topics discussed ahead you will likely strongly disagree
with something or the other.</p><p>That's fine! We probably just have different values.</p></div><p>In my view, Emacs has the following core values:</p><p><strong>Emacs</strong></p><ul><li>Extensibility</li><li>Freedom</li><li>Introspectability</li><li>Keyboard centrism</li><li>Stability</li><li>Text centrism</li></ul><p>We can feel the clasp of <em>stability</em> in the following—rather
poetic—exchange in the Emacs development mailing list, which also provides
useful historical perspectives.</p><blockquote><p>Emacs is older than the operating systems people use today. (It is almost
as old as the first Unix, which barely resembled the Unix of later
decades.) It is much older than Linux, the kernel.</p><p>The oldest design elements were not designed for the uses we make of them
today. And since we wrote those, people have developed other areas of
software which don’t fit Emacs very well. So there are good reasons to
redesign some of them.</p><p>However, people actually use Emacs, so a greatly incompatible change in
Emacs is as unthinkable as a greatly incompatible change in the New York
City subway.</p><p>We have to build new lines through the maze of underground pipes and
cables.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-09/msg00607.html">Richard Stallman in “Re: Discoverability (was: Changes for 28)” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>The following exchange reifies <em>freedom</em> and <em>stability</em> while demonstrating a
disinclination to <em>progressiveness</em>. Which is neither good nor bad; it’s just
what it is.</p><blockquote><p>If Emacs was to become a “modern” app tomorrow, an editor extended in Lisp
still only has appeal for a minority of programmers, much like the Lisp
language itself. Most programmers looking for easy and modern experiences
will likely stick with Atom and Sublime.</p><p>Most of the push for a “modern look” comes from the desire for Emacs to
play more nicely with proprietary platforms. Rather, the goal of Emacs is
to support platforms like GNU/Linux. Platforms that respect your freedom,
and also do not push a corporate UI/UX vision of “modernity”.</p><p>(Perhaps if we do move forward with modernization, we should think of
modernization in the context of something like GNOME rather than MacOS or
Windows. Surely Emacs could be a better citizen of GNOME.)</p><p>Given that many of the people complaining about “how Emacs looks” are not
submitting patches to fix the problem themselves, resources would be
diverted from actual functionality to “modernity”.</p><p>By the time we do major code refactoring “modernizing” Emacs on the major
proprietary platforms, what is “modern” has now once again changed, and our
resources were put towards a project with a poor return on investment.</p><p>Basically, I don’t see a “modernizing” project playing out well. We will
spend extensive time and energy on a moving target, and even if we succeed,
our Lisp-based vision still has limited appeal. Additionally, I don’t think
“modernizing” Emacs advances the cause of free software, given that there
are other more popular casual libre tools for text editing that individuals
can use.</p><p>— <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/863691n4xl.wl-me%40enzu.ru/">Ahmed Khanzada in “Re: Why is emacs so square?” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>Core values are self-reinforcing. They attract like-minded people, who
will then defend them.</p><p>I’m an Emacs user, and reading the Emacs mailing lists serves to remind me
that my values are very different from the values held by maintainers and
core contributors. I don’t value <em>freedom</em> or <em>stability</em> nearly as strongly
and have an inner affinity for <em>progressiveness</em> and <em>velocity</em>.</p><p>One part of valuing progressiveness is constantly re-evaluating: is our
current process or technology as good as it could be? What could be
improved? How do we measure improvement? How are others solving these
problems? Were there any advances in our area that we could leverage?</p><p>* * *</p><p>Now let’s talk about Vim. I see Vim as intersecting with a few of Emacs’
values, but ultimately diverging radically with its narrow focus on
providing really efficient editing capabilities.</p><p><strong>Vim</strong></p><ul><li>Doing one thing well</li><li>Editing efficiency</li><li>Keyboard centrism</li><li>Stability</li><li>Text centrism</li></ul><p>One might notice that <em>extensibility</em> is not in the list. That’s
intentional. Vim is certainly extensible to a degree, but it just does not
compare to Emacs. Vim <em>has</em> a “plugin system”, while Emacs <em>is</em> the system.
Your code becomes part of it the moment it’s evaluated. Since I’m sticking
to <em>yes/no</em> indicators for values I’m giving it a <em>no</em>.</p><p><em>Stability</em> emanates from communications with the primary maintainer.</p><blockquote><p>Vim development is slow, it’s quite stable and still there are plenty of
bugs to fix. Adding a new feature always means new bugs, thus hardly any
new features are going to be added now. I did add a few for Vim 7.3, and
that did introduce quite a few new problems. Even though several people
said the patch worked fine.</p><p>— <a href="http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Scrolling-screen-lines-I-knew-it-s-impossible-td3358342.html#a3359206">Bram Moolenar in “Re: Scrolling screen lines, I knew, it’s impossible.”
(2011)</a></p></blockquote><p>And of course in this famous exchange in a QA session.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>How can the community ensure that the Vim project succeeds for the
foreseeable future?</p></blockquote><p>Keep me alive.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.binpress.com/vim-creator-bram-moolenaar-interview/">Bram Moolenaar in “10 Questions with Vim’s creator” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>At the end of 2013, a few folks were trying to get new concurrency
primitives merged into Vim. This would empower plugin authors to create
entirely new types of functionality and by extension, make Vim better.</p><p>This is what one of them had to say about the process:</p><blockquote><p>The author of Neovim (Thiago de Arruda) tried to add support for
multi-threaded plugins to Vim and has been stymied.</p><p>I’m not sure how to get a patch merged into Vim. Bram Moolenar is the only
person with commit access, and he’s not a fan of most changes beyond bug
fixes. My co-founder and I tried to add setTimeout &amp; setInterval to
vimscript. Even six weeks of full-time effort and bending over backwards
wasn’t enough. Eventually we were just ignored.</p><p>I’ve contributed to a lot of open source projects, and the Vim community
has been the most difficult to work with. I’ve been writing C for almost
two decades, and the Vim codebase is the worst C I’ve ever seen. The
project is definitely showing its age, and I’d love for something new to
replace it.</p><p>— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7279358">Geoff Greer in “Neovim (HN)” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>While they understood that some of their values were ultimately
incompatible with the values of the Vim maintainers—who prioritized
<em>stability</em>—they still tried to push for a change, because they treasured
the <em>idea of Vim</em>, embodied by some of its values.</p><p>It didn’t happen, so a Vim fork came to life: Neovim.</p><p>The vision was grand, and is summarized in a statement of its values:</p><blockquote><p>Neovim is a Vim-based text editor engineered for <em>extensibility</em> and
<em>usability</em>, to encourage new applications and contributions.</p><p><a href="https://neovim.io/charter/">neovim.io/charter</a></p></blockquote><p>Some of their concrete plans included</p><ul><li>improving testing, tooling, and CI to simplify maintenance, make
aggressive refactorings possible, and greatly reduce contributor friction</li><li>decoupling the core from the UI, making it possible to embed the Vim core
into browsers or IDEs (or any computer program really), also making way
for more powerful and diverse GUIs</li><li>embedding a Lua runtime and providing concurrency primitives to open the
doors for smoother, more efficient, and powerful plugins</li><li>extensive refactoring: bringing C code to modern standards (C99,
leveraging new compiler features), replacing platform-specific IO code
with libuv, removing support for legacy systems and compilers, including
automatic formatting, and fixing static analysis warnings and errors</li><li>creating a scriptable terminal emulator</li></ul><p>And they delivered it.</p><p>In a very short amount of time they were able to, and I don’t use this word
lightly, <em>revolutionize</em> Vim. The impact can be seen in Vim development,
which picked up considerably as Neovim gained ground, with features and
processes ending up being reimplemented in Vim.</p><div><p>And they aren't stopping there. Current plans include:</p><ul><li>translating all Vimscript to Lua under the hood, increasing execution
performance due to leveraging LuaJIT, a very, very fast runtime</li><li>shipping a built-in LSP client</li></ul></div><p>Neovim builds upon Vim, and the way I see it, holds the following core
values:</p><p><strong>Neovim</strong></p><ul><li>Approachability</li><li>Editing efficiency</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>BitLocker is a modern data protection feature that is deeply integrated in the Windows kernel. It is used by many corporations as a means of protecting company secrets in case of theft. Microsoft recommends that you have a Trusted Platform Module which can do some of the heavy cryptographic lifting for you.</p><p>Given a Windows 10 system without known passwords and a BitLocker-protected hard drive, an administrator account could be adding by doing the following:</p><ul><li>At the sign-in screen, select “I have forgotten my password.”</li><li>Bypass the lock and enable autoplay of removable drives.</li><li>Insert a USB stick with my .exe and a junction folder.</li><li>Run executable.</li><li>Remove the thumb drive and put it back in again, go to the main screen.</li><li>From there launch narrator, that will execute a DLL payload planted earlier.</li></ul><p>Now a user account is added called hax with password “hax” with membership in Administrators. To update the list with accounts to log into, click <em>I forgot my password</em> and then return to the main screen.</p><h2 id="bypassing-the-lock-screen"> <a href="#bypassing-the-lock-screen">Bypassing the lock screen</a></h2><p>First, we select the “I have forgotten my password/PIN” option. This option launches an additional session, with an account that gets created/deleted as needed; the user profile service calls it a default-account. It will have the first available name of defaultuser1, defaultuser100000, defaultuser100001, etc.</p><p>To escape the lock, we have to use the Narrator because if we manage to launch something, we cannot see it, but using the Narrator, we will be able to navigate it. However, how do we launch something?</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/1.png" alt=""></p><p>If we smash shift 5 times in quick succession, a link to open the Settings app appears, and the link actually works. We cannot see the launched Settings app. Giving the launched app focus is slightly tricky; you have to click the link and then click a place where the launched app would be visible with the correct timing. The easiest way to learn to do it is, keep clicking the link roughly 2 times a second. The sticky keys windows will disappear. Keep clicking! You will now see a focus box is drawn in the middle of the screen. That was the Settings app, and you have to stop clicking when it gets focus.</p><p>Now we can navigate the Settings app using CapsLock + Left Arrow, press that until we reach Home. Now, when Home has focus, hold down Caps Lock and press Enter. Using CapsLock + Right Arrow navigate to Devices and CapsLock + Enter when it is in focus.</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/2.png" alt=""></p><p>Now navigate to AutoPlay, CapsLock + Enter and choose “Open Folder to view files (File Explorer).” Now insert the prepared USB drive, wait some seconds, the Narrator will announce the drive has been opened, and the window is focused. Now select the file <strong>Exploit.exe</strong> and execute it with CapsLock + Enter. That is arbitrary code execution, ladies and gentlemen, without using any passwords. However, we are limited by running as the default profile.</p><p>I have made a video with my phone, as I cannot take screenshots.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdsSgklRoag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2 id="elevation-of-privilege"> <a href="#elevation-of-privilege">Elevation of privilege</a></h2><p>When a USB stick is mounted, BitLocker will create a directory named ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation in System Volume Information and set permissions to:</p><div><div><pre><code>NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
</code></pre></div></div><p>To redirect the create operation, a symbolic link in the NT namespace is needed as that allows us to control the filename, and the existence of the link does not abort the operation as it is still creating the directory.</p><p>Therefore, take a USB drive and make <code>\System Volume Information</code> a mount point targeting <code>\RPC Control</code>. Then make a symbolic link in <code>\RPC Control\ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation</code> targetting <code>\??\C:\windows\system32\Narrator.exe.local</code>. If the USB stick is reinserted then the folder <code>C:\windows\system32\Narrator.exe.local</code> will be created with permissions that allows us to create a subdirectory:</p><div><div><pre><code>amd64_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.18362.657_none_e6c5b579130e3898
</code></pre></div></div><p>Inside this subdirectory, we drop a payload DLL named <em>comctl32.dll</em>. Next time the Narrator is triggered, it will load the DLL. By the way, I chose the Narrator as that is triggerable from the login screen as a system service and is not auto-loaded, so if anything goes wrong, we can still boot.</p><h2 id="combining-them"> <a href="#combining-them">Combining them</a></h2><p>The <code>ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation</code> exploit to work requires a symbolic link in <code>\RPC Control</code>. The executable on the USB drive creates the link using two calls to <code>DefineDosDevice</code>, making the link permanent so they can survive a logout/in if needed.</p><p>Then a loop is started in which the executable will:</p><ul><li>Try to create the subdirectory.</li><li>Plant the payload <code>comctl32.dll</code> inside it.</li></ul><p>It is easy to see when the loop is running because the Narrator will move its focus box and say “access denied” every second. We can now use the link created in <code>RPC Control</code>. Unplug the USB stick and reinsert it. The writeable directory will be created in <code>System32</code>; on the next loop iteration, the payload will get planted, and exploit.exe will exit. To test if the exploit has been successful, close the Narrator and try to start it again.</p><p>If the narrator does not work, it is because the DLL is planted, and Narrator executes it, but it fails to add an account because it is launched as <code>defaultuser1</code>. When the payload is planted, you will need to click back to the login screen and start Narrator; 3 beeps should play, and a message box saying the DLL has been loaded as <code>SYSTEM</code> should show. Great! The account has been created, but it is not in the list. Press “I forgot my password” and click back to update the list.</p><p>A new account named hax should appear, with password hax.</p><p>I used these steps to arm the USB device</p><div><div><pre><code>C:\Users\jonas&gt;format D: /fs:ntfs /q

    <br>
    <h3>Whitespace steganography</h3>
    <p>
      The program SNOW is used to conceal messages in ASCII text by
      appending whitespace to the end of lines. Because spaces and tabs
      are generally not visible in text viewers, the message is
      effectively hidden from casual observers. And if the built-in
      encryption is used, the message cannot be read even if it is detected.
    </p>
    <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
    <p>
      SNOW exploits the Steganographic Nature Of Whitespace. Locating trailing
      whitespace in text is like finding a polar bear in a <em>snow</em>storm
      (which, by the way, explains the <a href="http://darkside.com.au/snow/logo.html">logo</a>).
      And it uses the <a href="http://darkside.com.au/ice/index.html">ICE</a>
      encryption algorithm, so the name is thematically consistent.
    </p>
    <h3>It's free!</h3>
    <p>
      As of 16 June 2013, SNOW is available under an Apache 2.0 licece.
      The usual conditions apply, but if you find SNOW useful for anything,
      the <a href="mailto:mkwan@darkside.com.au">author</a> would love to hear
      about it.
    </p>
    <h3>Recent changes</h3>
    <p>
      Prior to 22 November 1998 the DOS version, contained in
      <em>snowdos.zip</em>, had a bug affecting encryption. Files concealed
      with encryption using the DOS version could not be decrypted by the
      other versions, and vice versa. The bug was caused by bit-shifting of
      16-bit variables in DOS. This has now been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source version, when compiled under Unix, also had a bug where it
      could not read data concealed by the DOS version, owing to the carriage
      return character appended by DOS. This has also been fixed as of
      22 November 1998.

                <div><p>“The people that think you’re an asshole, they already think that about you now, Leo! You might as well do what you want anyway.” This Is what my friend Ed told me when I shared with him my fears about telling some grueling stories in my upcoming book. And what people might think about me when they read it and what I’ve done so far in my life. Strangely that was a huge relief.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they don’t think so negatively about me as I’d projected when they find out about another “outing”, it’ll probably bring us closer together. In a way, it’s a win-win.</p>
<p><a href="https://leowid.com/the-6-practices-that-influenced-my-life-the-most-over-the-past-5-years/">Radical honesty</a> is a bitch, I’m learning. It hurts so bad at times but also frees me so much.</p>

<p>What this leads to is courage. Courage is the thing we find when we give up on needing to be liked. Even for a brief moment. Then we are free to do what we want to do because we want to do it. This is real freedom.</p>
<p>It’s crushing and disappointing that we can’t stay there in that state of freedom. That we retreat again after a while into the darkness and the need to be liked and wanted. That’s ok, that’s life. From there, we garner and ripen the courage yet again to go out there and not care for what others think of us.</p>
<p>Along the way, we might make some friends that encourage us in this process and that back and forth. But it’s really not necessary to be too harsh on ourselves when we realize none of these states are permanent.</p>
<p>“Cheer up! You can’t blame anyone else for the kind of world that you’re in. And if you know that “I”, in the sense of the person, the front, the ego, it really doesn’t exist. Then it won’t go to your head to badly if you wake up and discover that you’re god.” is what Alan watts said, which I feel belongs here.</p>
<p>So go out there. And don’t worry about the people you fear think of you as an asshole, they already do that now anyway. You might as well take my friend Ed’s advice and do your thing regardless. Good luck and I’m here if I can help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p><a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-1/">First chapter</a> - <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-appendices/">Appendices</a> - <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-7/">Last chapter</a></p>

<p>This is a series of blog posts that shows you how to
build a text editor in Rust. It’s a re-implementation of
<a href="http://antirez.com/news/108">kilo</a> in Rust, as outlined in <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">this fantastic
tutorial</a>. Same as the
original booklet, these blog posts guide you through all the steps to build a
basic text editor, <code>hecto</code>.</p>

<p>You will almost always be able to see your changes in action by applying the
changes, saving and running the program. I will explain every step along the way
as best as I can - sometimes in great detail, and often linking to other pages.
Feel free to skim over the prose and ignore the links, there is plenty to learn
just by applying the code changes and watching your text editor grow!</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I have always thought that every software engineer needs to have more than
superficial knowledge of at least two programming languages. However, I have to
admit, that in the past few years, my knowledge in pretty much everything except
JavaScript has started to fade.</p>

<p>That’s why I started to learn Rust, and I have re-implemented <code>kilo</code> as a
learning experience. But <em>why</em>? In order to learn Rust, I wanted ro re-implement
a well-understood piece of software, so that I could focus on the language
without getting lost in the implementation details. But I did not want to
re-implement stuff I used JavaScript for, as I think that JavaScript is designed
for a different problem space than Rust. Or in other words: If you are a
plumber, you best learn how to use an axe by using it to chop down some trees,
and not to unclog a sink.</p>

<p><code>kilo</code> is complex enough to pose a challenge, and when I read it, I wished it
was available for Rust - and now it is!</p>

<p>And <em>why</em> the name? <code>hecto</code> follows more modest goals than <code>kilo</code>. It does not
aim to be small, and it wasn’t even my own idea - so it seemed appropriate to
give it a more modest name than its spiritual predecessor.</p>

<h2 id="license">License</h2>

<h3 id="indication-of-changes">Indication of Changes</h3>
<p>While these blog posts are based firmly on the <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">original
tutorial</a>, the code has
been adapted to Rust, not only by calling the closest “rust counterpart
function”, but by trying to solve things “the rust way”. Similarily, all
explanations have been checked and revised, and in many cases heavily rewritten,
in the context of Rust. Therefore, this tutorial should be seen as a “rust
remix” of the original <code>C</code> version.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>I’m happy that you read my work and would love to <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/about">hear from you</a> - especially if you are either stuck or have found a
better way to solve specific things. Keep in mind that this is mostly an
exercise for me to get to know Rust - so if there’s a better way to do things,

<p>Back in October of 2016, the partnership of Dubai Municipality and Philips Lighting released their Dubai Lamp, a series of the “world’s most efficient commercially available” LED light bulbs. This past Sunday, May 7, two Dubai developers signed a deal for the installation of these Dubai Lamps for their upcoming projects.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp.jpg" alt="dubai lamp" width="450" height="305" srcset="https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp.jpg 450w, https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp-300x203.jpg 300w, https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp-390x264.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>

<p>Dubai is a city-state located in the country of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). For a visual, the UAE is located at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, neighboring&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Omen.&nbsp;The partnership between Philips and Dubai Municipality began as an initiative by Dubai for the commitment of sustainability. It is Dubai’s goal to seek a 30% cut in&nbsp;their energy consumption by 2030, as well as a reduction of carbon emissions by 16% in the year 2021.</p>

<p>Through their partnership, Philips Lighting and Dubai Municipality created the Dubai Lamp, a light bulb that is said to decrease an electricity bill by 90%. According to a press release on Philips Lighting website, this is the world’s first commercially available light bulb that produces 200 lumen per watt. The Dubai Lamp comes in 4 different light bulb varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Watt, equivalent to 25W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>2 Watt, equivalent to 40W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>3 Watt, equivalent to 60W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>3 Watt Spot light bulb, equivalent to 35W or 50W&nbsp;halogen light bulb. Lifetime = 25,000 hours, or 25 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>All 4 light bulbs are available in warm white tone and cool daylight, and last 15 times longer than your conventional light bulb. Even though it is said to be the “world’s most efficient commercially available” LED light bulb, the Dubai Lamp is applicable in households as well as businesses.</p>

<p>Throughout this year alone, Philips Lighting and Dubai Municipality are preparing, for market-use, 2 million of these Dubai Lamps. That number is said to increase to 10 million by the year 2021.</p>

<p>The 4-year deal that was signed this past Sunday with Emaar and Dubai Properties Group to integrate the Dubai Lamps in their new&nbsp;facilities is said to include a study conducted by Dubai Municipality to monitor the energy savings that the Dubai Lamp is said to&nbsp;achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developer&nbsp;Emaar is known for building&nbsp;the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, as well as the&nbsp;Dubai Mall, one of the world’s largest shopping centers. Dubai Properties Group is a well-established real estate developer, known for numerous Dubai destinations including&nbsp;Jumeirah Beach Residences (JBR), Dubailand, Business Bay, and Culture Village, among other housing and retail spaces.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>At least a significant portion of their supporters, according to U of Aarhus researchers.</p>
<p>When two competing political parties in Denmark reversed their policy stance on an issue — suddenly they both supported reducing unemployment benefits — their voters immediately moved their opinions by around 15% into line with their party.</p>
<p>The same thing happened when one of these parties shifted from opposing to supporting ending Denmark’s early retirement.</p>
<p>The researchers were studying how public opinion is formed. Their recent paper sheds light on how much influence political parties have over their supporters, according to the researchers, who surveyed their panel of subjects in five successive waves between 2010 and 2011. They studied the same group of party supporters before, during and after a policy reversal.</p>
<p>“We can see that [the] welfare programs were actually quite popular … and many of the voters of the center-right party were in favor of these welfare programs,” commented one of the researchers, Rune Slothuus. “Nevertheless, we can see that they reversed their opinion from supporting these welfare programs to opposing these welfare programs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was surprised to see the parties appeared this powerful in shaping opinions,” Slothuus said. “Our findings suggest that partisan leaders can indeed lead citizens’ opinions in the real world, even in situations where the stakes are real and the economic consequences tangible.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers pondered Western democracy in light of their findings: “If citizens just blindly follow their party without thinking much about it, that should lead to some concern about the mechanisms in our democracy. Because how can partisan elites represent citizens’ views if the views of citizens are shaped by the very same elites who are supposed to represent them?”</p>

    <h3>The brain listens for things it is trying to predict</h3>
    <div><p>The brain interprets sounds as they contrast with its expectations; it recognizes patterns of sounds faster when they’re in line with what it is predicting it will hear, but it only encodes sounds when they contrast with expectations, according to <span>Technische U researchers. </span></p>
<p>The researchers showed this by monitoring the two principal nuclei of the subcortical pathway responsible for auditory processing: the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, as their subjects listened to patterns of sounds which the researches modified so that sometimes they would hear an expected sound pattern, and other times something unexpected.</p>

It didn’t matter if they were walking or watching someone else, according to UC researchers led by Dr Matthias Stangl.</p>
<p>The researchers also tested what happened when subjects searched for a hidden spot, or watched someone else do so, and found that brain waves flowed more strongly when they had a goal and hunted for something.</p>

    <h3>Extroverts and introverts use different vocabularies</h3>
    <div><p>Extroverts use ‘positive emotion’ and ‘social process’ words more often than introverts, according to new research conducted at <span>Nanyang Technological U</span>.</p>
<p>‘Love,’ ‘happy,’ and ‘blessed’ indicate pleasant emotions, and ‘beautiful’ and ‘nice’ indicate positivity or optimism, and are among the words found to be used more often by extroverts. So too are ‘meet,’ ‘share,’ and ‘talk,’ which are about socializing. Extroverts use personal pronouns — except ‘I’ — more too, another indication of sociability.</p>
<p>The correlation, however, was small, and the researchers think that stronger linguistic indicators need to be found to achieve their general goal, which is improving machine learning approaches to targeting consumer marketing.</p>

    <h3>WhatsApp is changing today - Users must give the app permission to send their private data to Facebook or lose account</h3>
    <div><p>WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014, but has thrived while promoting itself as a privacy-respecting messaging app that now has 1.5b monthly active users. This week, though, WhatApp sent out an update to users’ phones that they must ‘consent’ to a new policy or lose access.</p>
<p>Whatsapp will now share more of your data, including your IP address (your location) and phone number, your account registration information, your transaction data, and service-related data, interactions on WhatsApp, and other data collected based on your consent, with Facebook’s other companies. Facebook has been working towards more closely integrating Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.</p>
<p>Users who do not agree to ‘consent’ to the new policy will see their WhatsApp account become inaccessible until they do ‘consent.’ These accounts will remain dormant for 120 days after which they will be ‘deleted.’</p>
<p>The biggest change to the user policy, which many people ignored and clicked ‘agree’ to, thinking it was just another unimportant app update message, now reads,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, “about” information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your “last seen”); and when you last updated your “about” information.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, Elon Musk tweeted on the news, saying that WhatsApp users should switch to Signal, one of several popular privacy-focused messaging apps similar to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The data sharing policy change doesn’t affect people in Europe due to GDPR data protection regulations.</p>

    <h3>President Trump silenced on top social media platforms after mob storms Capitol</h3>
    <div><p>The US president was locked out from posting new messages on his Facebook and Twitter accounts after an unruly group of supporters assembled outside the capitol building where Biden’s election win was being confirmed.</p>
<p>The lockdown on Twitter lasted 12 hours until the president removed tweets Twitter said violated its ‘civic integrity policy,’ but Zuckerburg said that Trump would be silenced on Facebook and Instagram for at least two more weeks until his presidential term was over. Facebook and Twitter are two of the main ways the president communicates with citizens and the world.</p>
<p>It is the first time social media platforms have chosen to limit the free speech of such an important figure.</p>
<h6><em>Trump’s tweets from Jan 6, 2020, as recorded by thetrumparchive.com</em></h6>


<p>Many news organizations covered the story using language such as <a href="https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trump-Incites-Rioters.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="69001008" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="15093_15041">‘Trump Incites Rioters.’</a></p>
<p>Following Trumps ‘ban,’ there was renewed talk about treating social media platforms, where people share informative content, as publishers themselves, in part because their algorithms amplify things shared when those things are engaging. There was also talk about how the social media platforms that censored the president’s content did so as a response to content or events but without first drawing their ‘red line’ and saying which content is and isn’t allowed on their platforms.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s staff resigned following the incident at the Capitol building, and there were also a lot of questions why the national guard wasn’t capable of handling the incident properly.</p>
<p>UPDATE January 8: Twitter permanently banned Trump’s account. Google removed Parler, an app like Twitter used by Trump supporters, from the Android app store to make it harder for people to download it, saying Google requires social media apps to have content moderation policies to remove posts that incite violence.</p>

    <p><strong>the below does not explain what Gemini is, but <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">this does</a></strong></p>

<p>Reading people’s gemlogs, I get a sense of a smaller internet. I stumble across an article about Pacific Northwest seaweed, a list of types. Someone else writes her thoughts: “Really, prepare to question groupthink”. A history of adoptable cyberpets. It is addicting to read people’s neat summaries of interests, ascii art embellishments.</p>

<p>But something about it makes me sad.</p>

<p>There’s something called the Eternal September, about how – well, should I be pretending to tell you from the position of someone who’d know? It happened the month after I was born.</p>

<p>Every September before, college students with new network access would stream onto Usenet fora without ever having accustomed themselves to the etiquette. Things would get rowdy and stupid for a while. Then they would learn or get bored and things would quiet down again.</p>

<p>That September, though, was more than just college students – America Online offered Usenet access to all its members. Ever after, the numbers would be dominated by those who had no manners, who didn’t know there was culture to learn. September continued forever.</p>

<p>The design of Gemini isn’t the community. I’m sure there are a few people who use the bridged NPR website available served via Gemini who are really in it because they’re Just That Mad About JavaScript, but those aren’t the people who make the place. It’s a bunch of people who learned a new markup language and installed some new fiddly tools and wrote their journals in plain text and taught me what seaweed is edible… why?</p>

<p>Something about Gemini strikes me as a grail quest for the Eternal August, before webscale crushed the things we love.</p>

<p>While everything I have seen served via Gemini is friendly and sociable, the technical barriers of what-is-a-command-line and how-do-I-use-one are a fence put up that keep out the riffraff. Certainly, you can walk around the corner and go through the gate, but ultimately the geminiverse is lovely because it is underpopulated, slower-paced, and literate. It is difficult enough to access that those who can use it can be welcoming without worrying its smallness will be compromised.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that I don’t think many of its denizens would claim that they <em>only</em> want to hear from technical, educated people, but in order to use a <em>small</em> internet, an August internet, they have let the fence keep out anyone else.</p>

<p>This is the part of the piece where I pivot to My Proposal to Fix Everything, right? Where I tell you about my new community or my idea for what people should be doing or if we only started using tags <em>right</em>…</p>

<p>I don’t know that I think that it’s that neat.</p>

<p>I will probably keep reading things on Gemini, keep querying its search engine for terms and being delighted by neatly crafted plain-text.</p>

<p>But I will probably keep finding it sad.</p>

    <p>As of this writing (but perhaps not for very much longer!) the four mainstream compilers
on Godbolt Compiler Explorer give four different answers for
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jo3dc4">this simple C++ program</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A {
    using T = T1;
    using U = U1;
    operator U1 T1::*();
    operator U1 T2::*();
    operator U2 T1::*();
    operator U2 T2::*();
};

inline auto which(U1 T1::*) { return "gcc"; }
inline auto which(U1 T2::*) { return "icc"; }
inline auto which(U2 T1::*) { return "msvc"; }
inline auto which(U2 T2::*) { return "clang"; }

int main() {
    A a;
    using T = T2;
    using U = U2;
    puts(which(a.operator U T::*()));
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The question is whether <code>U</code> should be looked up in the scope of <code>test</code> or in the scope of <code>A</code>;
and the same question for <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>According to the current draft standard, it sounds like the conforming answer is
“they should <em>both</em> be looked up in the scope of <code>A</code>”; i.e., GCC’s answer is correct
and the others are wrong in three different ways. <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.lookup.unqual#5">[basic.lookup.unqual]/5</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unqualified name that is a component name of a <em>type-specifier</em> or <em>ptr-operator</em>
of a <em>conversion-type-id</em> is looked up in the same fashion as the <em>conversion-function-id</em>
in which it appears. If that lookup finds nothing, it undergoes unqualified name lookup;
in each case, only names that denote types or templates whose specializations are types are considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m never a fan of lookups that don’t consider certain <em>kinds</em> of names; I’m sure there’s more divergence
to be discovered in this area. Anyway, in the type name <code>U T::*</code>, <code>U</code> is the <em>type-specifier</em>
and <code>T::*</code> is the <em>ptr-operator</em>, and the whole type is pronounced “pointer to a data member of <code>T</code>,
where that data member itself is of type <code>U</code>.”
(More concisely: “pointer to data member (of type <code>U</code>) of <code>T</code>,” or “pointer to a <code>U</code> member of <code>T</code>.”)</p>

			<p><strong>The social media platform Minds had to remove ‘major functionality’ from its Android app after getting a chilling warning from Google. Its co-founder said plans for a censorship-resistant infrastructure are in the works.</strong></p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1196949029506060288" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">post</a>&nbsp;on Friday evening, Bill Ottman said that Minds had received a&nbsp;<em>“24 hour warning”</em>&nbsp;from the Google Play store. This forced them to submit an updated version of the app, based on&nbsp;<em>“interim solution and ninja developers,”</em> which removed the search, discovery and comments functionality.</p>
<p><em>“I know. We aren’t happy and will be working towards something better,”</em>&nbsp;Ottman said.&nbsp;<em>“What is happening on the internet with major providers is fueling the cultural divide as much as anything,”</em>&nbsp;he added.</p>
<p>Operating since 2015, Minds was conceived as a blockchain-based community-owned social media platform that would not monetize user data but enable free speech instead.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minds-anti-facebook/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wired</a>&nbsp;magazine once described it as the&nbsp;<em>“anti-Facebook.”</em></p>
<p><em>Owen is joined by James O’Keefe of Project Veritas, after the explosive video released of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who revealed his true intentions on social media.</em></p>
<p>Ottman advised users to download the app from Minds directly if possible.&nbsp;<em>“If you are on Apple, leave if you’re smart,”</em>&nbsp;he said.</p>


<p>As for going forward, he said a plan for&nbsp;<em>“fully censorship-resistant infrastructure”</em>&nbsp;is coming soon, and that Minds has&nbsp;<em>“multiple escape pods ready to go”</em>&nbsp;if Amazon moves against them.</p>
<p>Ottman’s comments were a clear reference to what happened to Parler. The free-speech social media platform attracted tens of thousands of users purged from Twitter in the wake of the January 6 unrest at the US Capitol – only to be banned from Google and Apple stores, and then taken down from the internet entirely after Amazon Web Services (AWS) denied them access to the cloud. Parler’s executives later revealed that other vendors rushed to jump ship as well, leaving them unable to operate entirely.</p>
<p>Those who complained about the rising tide of censorship have typically been told that the First Amendment to the US Constitution did not apply to private companies and that people should&nbsp;<em>“build their own”</em>&nbsp;platforms if they disagreed. Parler’s shutdown has shown that this is near-impossible when the major players control the internet infrastructure itself, however.</p>
<p>Mainstream media and tech platforms have gone after Parler, Gab, Minds, and Telegram for allegedly having&nbsp;<em>“far-right”</em>users and allowing&nbsp;<em>“hate speech”</em>&nbsp;as content. In Parler’s case, Amazon’s ultimatum demanded moderation policies they would approve of in order to avoid removal from AWS.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit accusing Amazon of breach of contract, antitrust violations and defamation, Parler argued that this was pretextual and revealed that Amazon staff sought to find out if US President Donald Trump – freshly banned from Twitter and locked out of Facebook – had set up an account on the platform.</p>
