<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8890"><div><div><div><p>VK social networking website and Telegram messenger App founder and developer, Pavel Durov wants Apple to let iPhone users install different App stores other than Apple App Store. Not only that, but he also wants legislation to make this happen.</p><p>Speaking at the panel discussion with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and representatives of the IT industry in Innopolis, Telegram Manager and Vice President, Ilya Perekopsky said that Apple and Google are holding back the development of startups by charging a tax of 30 percent commission from app developers. Immediately after Perekopsky’s speech,&nbsp;Durov published an article in which he called for legislation mandating Apple to be legally obliged to allow users to install an alternative App Store on the iPhone. Durov says that Tim Cook, Apple CEO should be obligated to this at the legislative level.</p><p>Durov is taking the bull by its horn. Apple has been successful because of its closed technology. It not only does not allow any other App store to be installed on iPhones but it also takes action against any iPhone jailbreaks that happen. We all know that the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/unc0ver-jailbreak-tool-for-iphone-released-works-on-all-ios-versions-including-ios-13-5/">uc0ver team released a jailbreak</a> exploiting the previously unknown vulnerability in iOS just hours after Apple released iOS 13.5. The <a href="https://androidrookies.com/kernel-vulnerability-unc0ver-jailbreak-patched-as-apple-releases-ios-13-5-1/">iPhone jailbreak was shut down in iOS 13.5.1</a> within days by Apple. Many private iPhone App stores exist like Cydia, Xabsi, etc but they work only on jailbroken iPhones.</p><p>Much of Apple’s profit is from selling content on its App stores. In fact, Apple’s App Store platform grossed around $50 billion for App store in 2019, according to an analysis by CNBC. Apple takes 30 percent commission from App developers to make their apps available on Apple Store. Last year it paid $35 billion to developers from the App store revenue and kept $15 billion for itself.</p><p>Durov has reasons for being mad at Apple for not allowing other App stores. Durov says that Russian startups fail to make money by paying 30% to Apple. “Preventing two supranational corporations from collecting taxes from all of humanity is not an easy task. Corporations employ thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, and PR agents, and their budgets are unlimited. At the same time, app developers are scattered and scared, as the fate of their projects depends entirely on the favor of Apple and Google,” wrote Pavel Durov.</p><p>Durov also has a personal bias for wanting Apple to open up its iOS for alternative App stores. In 2016, Apple banned the Telegram team from launching its own game platform. This hurt Durov and Telegram’s ambitions, “We had to remove the telegram games catalog that we had already created and almost the entire platform interface, otherwise Apple threatened to remove Telegram from the AppStore.”</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://androidrookies.com/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-com-email-app-unless-it-pays-outrageous-cuts-to-them/">email client, Hey.com</a> had a similar experience with Apple regarding publishing their App on the Apple App store.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/">Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste</a>, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.</p>

<p>So I ran a web page performance test and got some <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/">grim results</a>: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/">using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL</a>. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.</p>

<p>But how much energy? I used the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> to find out. Turns out that</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage</li>
  <li>it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and</li>
  <li>it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km</li>
</ul>

<p>Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.</p>

<p>I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation’s directory</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll get rid of <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">my energy-guzzling site theme</a> until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a>. <strong>SIGNED</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NEW</strong>: I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show my committment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/">Website Carbon Badge</a> to all pages (<strong>DONE</strong>) and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/">Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>). Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a <a href="https://carbontxt.org/">carbon.txt</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>).</p>

<p>One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.</p>

<p>What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?</p>

July 15, 2020 | https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>We are incredibly excited to announce that <strong>Riot is now Element</strong>! </p><p>In fact we have simplified all our naming: Element is also the name for New Vector (the company behind Riot) while Modular, our flagship Matrix hosting service, has become Element Matrix Services.</p><p>For those discovering us for the first time: Element is the flagship secure collaboration app for the decentralised <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> communication network. &nbsp;Element lets you own your own end-to-end encrypted chat server, while still connecting to everyone else in the wider Matrix network.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/element-logo.png"></figure><p><br>What’s more, <strong>RiotX is now out of beta</strong> - our next generation Matrix client for Android has flown the nest and spread its wings as Element - replacing the old Riot Android app at last!</p><p>This name change has been a long time in the making. As we explained when we announced the rebrand <a href="https://blog.riot.im/the-world-is-changing/">a few weeks ago</a>, we’ve had major issues with a certain gigantic games company which has blocked us from being able to trademark Riot or even Riot.im - a huge issue when it comes to defending users against abusive forks of the app. Secondly, people incorrectly assume Riot refers to violence, rather than the more constructive forms of chaos we had in mind. Lastly, it made sense in the early days of Matrix to have different brands to illustrate the different roles of Riot, Modular and New Vector in the ecosystem… but nowadays there are loads of Matrix clients, Matrix hosting providers and companies building on Matrix - and so all New Vector’s different names were just causing confusion. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="so-why-element">So, why Element?</h3><p>We want a name that reflects the emphasis on simplicity and clarity that we aimed for when designing RiotX; a name that highlights our single-minded mission to make Element the most elegant and usable mainstream comms app imaginable. &nbsp;Riot had a pretty chequered history, spending much of its life in beta, with intermittent attention to design until we hit 1.0 last year - but nowadays we have a dedicated full-time design team working on Element, who not only design the graphics but the overall behaviour of new features in the app. &nbsp;This is not an easy task, given it turns out the hardest bits of end-to-end encryption are almost entirely UX challenges. &nbsp;What’s more, presenting a global decentralised communication network as simply as a centralised communication island is surprisingly tricky. &nbsp;However: we have been making massive progress, to the extent that we are barely recognisable as the Riot of the past. Element reflects a clean start to focus monomaniacally on mainstream usability in future.</p><p>We also want a name that better evokes the idea of data ownership and self-sovereignty. &nbsp;An element is the smallest indivisible thing in a system - yet one which can stand alone. &nbsp;You can customise it, control it and make it your own - you can literally be in your Element!</p><p>Moreover, we want a name that will be future-proof for peer-to-peer Matrix. &nbsp;As Matrix.org announced last month, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix is in heavy development</a> - and we can see a world where Element will literally be an element of Matrix, running your own homeserver within the app, so you can communicate if you don’t have a server… or even Internet. In fact, we published the first experimental build of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/07/10/this-week-in-matrix-2020-07-10#riot-ios-p2p-demo">P2P Riot for iOS</a> on Testflight a few days ago - so we can clearly see a future where we will be in our P2P element!</p><p>Finally, we think it’s a cool name :D &nbsp;It fits in nicely with the term Matrix while not being as nerdy as Vector. &nbsp;We’re obviously aware that Element is (once again) both a dictionary word and a mathematical term - but in practice, looking at search results for Element right now, the top hits are for dictionary sites(!) and the field is wide open. &nbsp;Conversely, in a virgin browser on VPN, Riot is the 4th hit on Google for Riot; second only to a certain games company. &nbsp;In other words, we’ve shown that we can successfully adopt dictionary words - and if you do find yourself lost searching in a maze of mathematics, just throw in the word ‘chat’ to get back on track. &nbsp;(For all the linear algebraists who are spitting with rage at this point: we promise we’ll make it up to you by finally sorting out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3251">latex support</a> in Element!)</p><p>This change is inevitably going to be disruptive, and we’re painfully aware that we’ve spent four years building up Riot’s reputation and persuading everyone to move their friends, families and teams onto it. &nbsp;To reiterate what we said when we announced the change, we know that many people reading this will have put their necks on the line to get folks to adopt Riot, and we really appreciate how frustrating it may be to have to explain the change to your users. &nbsp;However, this is unquestionably the right time to shed our skin and make the change, and we hope folks will grow to love Element much more than they ever did Riot. &nbsp;To aid the transition, we’ve named the installable apps “Element (Riot.im)” for a while to help people get reoriented (e.g. when searching by name for Riot).</p><p>Last but not least: Element isn’t just a new name - it comes with a massive suite of improvements across Android, iOS and Web.</p><p>We’ll write about these in full over the coming days, but the big headlines are that RiotX (our ground-up rewrite of Riot Android) has exited beta, and replaces Riot Android as Element - complete with VoIP calls and Widget support! Riot Android users will magically autoupgrade into Element; the old RiotX app will be retired in due course. FDroid is likely releasing Element as an entirely new app. &nbsp;Meanwhile On iOS we now have full support for iOS 13, complete with entirely new push notification support (thanks to Apple’s nightmarish <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/05/secure-messaging-apps-working-to-comply-with-apples-ios-13-privacy-changes">deprecation of PushKit</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/RiotX-1.png"><figcaption>The App Formerly Known As RiotX!</figcaption></figure><p>On Element Web, we’ve given the UI a massive refresh, with a beautiful new font (<a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>) giving much improved legibility, and we’ve <strong>completely</strong> rewritten the Room List control - adding in room previews(!!), alphabetic ordering, resizable lists, improved notification UI and more. We’ve also landed the first phase of further improving the end-to-end encryption setup process - letting users generate a recovery key rather than forcing them to select a recovery passphrase when setting up E2EE for the first time (the next phase is to delay setting up E2EE until the user actually starts talking in encrypted rooms).</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-15-at-00.54.45.png"></figure><p>So there you have it. Welcome to a whole new beginning for Riot: welcome to your new Element, one where mainstream Matrix users will enjoy themselves too - and which will pave the way for wider adoption of open, secure, decentralised communication via Matrix throughout the world.</p><p>- Matthew, Amandine, and the whole Element team.</p><p>P.S. Check out our <a href="https://element.io/">all-new website</a> and in particular the <a href="https://element.io/previously-riot">migration page</a> for much more information about our brave new world!<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2020-02-12T00:00">February 12, 2020</time><div><p>At its core, Sentry is a tool that alerts you to defects in your production software. But it does more than blast stack traces into your inbox: Sentry provides powerful workflows to help your team determine root cause, <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/02/07/sentry-workflow-triage">triage issues</a> to your team, and keep tabs on ongoing concerns with comments and notifications.</p>
<p>These collaborative features can help you resolve problems with your software quickly. But the keyword here is <strong>collaborative</strong>; without your full team having access to Sentry, you may find yourself quickly becoming overwhelmed with an endless backlog of issues and no one to help.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Growth team made it our mission to make it easier for our users to invite their teammates to join them on Sentry. To achieve this, we tackled three distinct areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surfacing the ability to invite users contextually</li>
<li>Expanding Sentry’s permission model to allow <em>more types of users</em> to send invitations </li>
<li>Allowing external users to request access themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Our theory: improving the user experience of inviting users, <em>as well as</em> democratizing the process to include all team members would lead to a significant increase in team-wide adoption. <em>(Narrator: it did.)</em></p>

<p>This full-page experience, tucked away deep in Sentry’s account settings, had a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since this is a full page, reaching it meant you would be taken out of context of whatever you were doing previously</li>
<li>Its location deep in our navigation hierarchy meant discoverability was poor</li>
<li>It’s <em>unclear</em> you can actually invite multiple people at once (you can!)</li>
<li>When inviting multiple users, you could only assign the group to the same role and collection of teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, to improve discoverability, we had previously introduced a number of “quick links” to reach this page more easily. But these links were scattered around the application, and didn’t appear contextually when users signaled intent to invite members.</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/4xiHp1Gl0HaZ0l8USGDPLr/79402583357d98cf55ad2dfda6ffe537/2-invitations.png" alt="" title="2-invitations"></p></figure><div>
<p>These user experience and discovery challenges felt like obvious starting places. But instead of just settling for a new “improved” form, we decided to rethink the entire experience from the ground up.</p>

</a>The new member invitation modal</h2>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that our first instinct was to convert this page into a modal –&nbsp;one that manages to squeeze all of the capabilities shown earlier into a smaller, more concise experience. It actually does one better: the modal is clearer in indicating that you can invite multiple users, and allows you to set unique permissions for each invitee.</p>

<p>While modals are sometimes overused in web applications, we believed this approach would solve our key discoverability and navigation concerns: it can be shown contextually without leaving the current page, and completing the form returns you to what you were doing.</p>
<p>To that point, we additionally introduced buttons to launch this <em>Invite New Members</em> modal contextually throughout Sentry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing an issue and notice a <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=node#after-associating-commits">suspect commit</a> made by a coworker? If they’re not already part of your Sentry organization, you can now invite them then and there.</li>
<li>Trying to assign an issue to a team member, but don’t see their name in the assignee list? You now have the option to invite them right in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Creating a new team? Now you can invite new members directly to that team as you go.</li>
</ul>

</a>Democratizing invitations</h2>
<p>As we began rolling out our new <em>Invite New Members</em> experience across the application, we came to a sobering realization: only roughly <strong><em>half</em></strong> of Sentry users could actually use our new modal. That’s because historically, only those with Owner or Manager-level permissions could invite other team members. Combined, users with these permissions accounted for less than 50% of active users.</p>

<p>Restricting the ability to add new users to account administrators is pretty common practice for software tools, and Sentry is no exception. When an employee onboards on a new team, it’s common to see an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh awesome, we use Sentry. Can you add me to the organization?
Bob: Ah, I can’t invite you. Maybe ask Jen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a perfect world, one of your administrators is tracked down, and they manually add the new teammate to the account. But sometimes that person is unknown, or is on a vacation, or maybe it takes them days or weeks or even months.</p>
<p>We began asking ourselves: what if we could unlock team members to fast-track this whole process and invite members themselves? This led to our next major change: updating our permission model to allow for <strong>members to request to invite other members.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when non-administrators open up the Invite New Members modal, it changes contextually to become a “request to invite” rather than a direct invitation. Hitting “send” kicks off an email to all organization administrators, who are prompted to approve any outstanding requests.</p>

<p>At this point, we had built what we thought was a fantastic new user experience and we just <em>doubled</em> the number of users who could take advantage of it. But this exercise of opening up user invitations got us thinking: what if there was an even <em>further</em> source of untapped users we weren’t reaching?</p>

</a>Removing the middleman entirely</h2>
<p>In the last section, we highlighted a scenario where one teammate asks another teammate for access to Sentry. And because of our recent changes, users can request to invite their teammates themselves instead of having to track down and ask their account administrator.</p>
<p>But this scenario still has a gatekeeping element: the new teammate has to ask <em>another</em> teammate for access. What if the new teammate spots an alert from Sentry in Slack stemming from their recent changes, and no one’s around to grant them access? Unfortunately, they’d land on an authentication wall that would prevent them from going any further.</p>

<p>This begged the question: was there an untapped source of potential users we weren’t reaching by restricting invitations <em>only</em> to active Sentry users? What if new users didn’t have to ask anyone at all?</p>
<p>So, to keep this party going, we dug in and additionally made it possible for <strong>external users to request to join an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Now when a user lands on an Organization’s login page, they have the option to “Request to join”, which asks for the user’s name and email address. Once they hit send, the organization owners are sent an email that prompts them to approve the join request. Just in case, there’s also a call-to-action to disable the feature entirely for their organization.</p>

<p>Having developed a new contextual invitation modal and a pair of invite-friendly permission changes, we were <em>feeling</em> confident that these changes were going to have a strong impact on user behavior. It was time now to put our money where our code was, and verify that all this hard work actually moved the needle.</p>

</a>A/B testing the impact</h2>
<p>Our standard procedure for validating the efficacy of product changes is through A/B testing (also known as split testing). This means instrumenting our application code to serve different experiences to segments of users over the same time period, and comparing the results. This step takes extra effort, but it’s worth it –&nbsp;the alternative is to settle for a before-and-after snapshot of data, which is too easily impacted by external factors like seasonality or marketing pushes.</p>
<p>ℹ️ <em>To learn more about how we perform A/B testing at Sentry, please see <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/05/09/easy-ab-testing-with-planout">this earlier blog post</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with A/B testing, and having so many permutations that you don’t have enough data to be statistically significant. So, to simplify things, we decided that all treatments would get the new modal experience, and our “treatment” groups would focus on the new permission changes.</p>
<p>This left us with 4 distinct treatments that we rolled out to 4 equally-sized customer segments:</p>

<li><strong>Baseline</strong> (new modal only)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Invite</strong> (user invites another user)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Join</strong> (external user requests to join)</li>
<li><strong><em>Both</em></strong> Request to Invite and Request to Join are enabled together</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main criteria for determining success: which of these treatments would result in <strong>an increase in <em>accepted</em> invitations</strong> (and thus new users)?</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/rlobEVJ4FCzWbU1tmPqqb/8ed779f9a63aa3382e5590cfa8e4bec1/11-invitations_2_.png" alt="" title="11-invitations"></p><figcaption><p>% of accepted invitations relative to baseline</p></figcaption></figure><div>
<p>After 30 days, the results became clear (not to mention, statistically significant):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Invite</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>9%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Join</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>21%</strong> more users accepted invitations who had both <em>Request to Invite</em> and <em>Request to Invite</em> treatments enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that allowing a wider set of users to invite team members resulted in more users inviting team members. It’s also probably not a surprise that enabling both feature sets at the same time was even better (given that they complement each other)!</p>

            What's Polygon Crest?</h2>
          <p>
            This program is a polygon editor. Maybe more commonly called a 
			polygon modeler. You can call whichever comfortable for you. The 
			main purpose is to build aircraft and ground visual models for YS 
			FLIGHT SIMULATOR, but you can use it for making general polygonal 
			models. If you make a correct solid model, you can export the data 
			for 3D printing, for example. I wanted to make it easy to create 
			aircraft models, so this program can quickly make a popular 
			airfoils, and extrude along the wing leading and trailing edges. It 
			also has basic boolean operations and rounding functions as well.

		  <ul>
			  <li>Digitally signed Mac OSX binary.&nbsp; You should be able to

			  <li>Linux binary is bundled in the Mac OSX package.&nbsp; You can 
			  run LinuxInstaller.py in the zip file, which will create an icon 
			  on the desktop.&nbsp; If it works well, I'm going to do the same 
			  for YSFLIGHT.</li>
			  <li>Now YSFLIGHT shares the same data structure of dynamic model 
			  (.DNM) with PolygonCrest.&nbsp; From the next version on, if you 
			  can open the .DNM file with PolygonCrest, it should (is supposed 
			  to) appear the same in YSFLIGHT.</li>
			  <li>Imprinting:&nbsp; You can imprinting a polygon or a constraint 
			  edge to a nearby polygons by selecting a polygon and then select 
			  Edit-&gt;Projection-&gt;Imprinting.</li>
			  <li>Sewing:&nbsp; You can select two vertices and select 
			  Edit-&gt;Local Operations-&gt;Sew between two vertices.&nbsp; Vertices

          First release!&nbsp; Version 20140716.&nbsp; I wanted to add more

<![CDATA[Breaking Down Lululemon's $500M Mirror Acquisition]]>

						<p>A few weeks back, lululemon acquired Mirror for $500M. When the news broke, we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/lululemon-acquires-mirror-500m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quick analysis</a>&nbsp;of how the partnership might play out. Today, we’re going deeper to explore lulu’s ambitions, Mirror’s motivation for selling, and how, in hindsight, Nike, Peloton, and COVID-19 sealed the deal.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>&nbsp;Even if this acquisition doesn’t pan out, everybody wins. Here’s why.</p>
					</section>

          <section>

        <div>
                      <h2>Calculated Risk</h2>
          
          <p>M&amp;A is a mixed bag. In the case of activewear retailers, buying into digital fitness via high-profile purchases has&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeVennare/status/1281301589190488064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proven futile</a>. So why did lululemon, a fast-growing apparel company, roll the dice on Mirror? One word: Nike.</p>
<p>Nike is the king of activewear. Try as they might, foes like adidas, Reebok, and Under Armour are no match for the swoosh. For its part, lululemon hopes to become a worthy adversary — if for no other reason than to remain in the good graces of Wall Street. On both accounts, Mirror factors heavily into the equation.</p>
<p>Putting this competition into context, lululemon trails Nike by an order of magnitude. Nike has a $152B market cap. Over the last 12 months, they’ve done $37B in sales. Meanwhile, lulu’s market cap is $37B, and the company had revenues of $3.85B over the same period.</p>
<p>While shares of the yoga pant maker have outperformed Nike in recent years, lulu might not ever reach the scale of Nike. But beating Nike outright isn’t the point. Ultimately, lululemon is in competition with itself, where Nike represents the upper bounds of what’s possible.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

            <div>
        <div>
                      <h2>Just Keep Growing</h2>
          
          <p>To prove that they haven’t peaked, lululemon has one mandate: just keep growing.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the yoga niche and expanding its total addressable market, the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://us15.campaign-archive.com/?u=4c6bc12e271bc681951ed945a&amp;id=96471d02c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five-year strategic plan</a>, released in April 2019, charted the path forward: “double men’s, double digital, and quadruple international” revenues. Add self-care products, a foray into footwear, and the opening of a 20,000-square-foot experiential store (complete with yoga studios and a restaurant) into the mix and grow they shall.</p>
<p>A few months later, in November of 2019, lululemon invested $1M into Mirror’s $34M Series B-1, a bargain for a foothold in connected fitness. As part of the investment, and in keeping with its goal of becoming an experiential brand, lululemon ambassadors began creating workout content for the Mirror platform.</p>
<p>Flash-forward to March: when COVID hit, the table was set. With retail stores shuttered and fitness studios closed, shopping and sweating moved online. In a few short weeks, lululemon had seen enough; they were ready to go all-in on Mirror.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first week of store closures, 170K people joined lulu’s live workouts on Instagram.</li>
<li>Pre-COVID, 64% of lululemon guests used a digital workout option at home.</li>
<li>During the pandemic, as the coronavirus spread, that number jumped to 75%.</li>
<li>86% of lulu customers who used an at-home option during the outbreak plan to continue or increase their new digital workout habit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In April, lulu’s online sales surged&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/11/lululemon-lulu-reports-fiscal-q1-2020-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">125%</a>, a trend that’s expected to continue. Add in the fact that some 50% of Mirror users are also lululemon customers, and this deal checks a lot of boxes for the growth-focused retailer.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

            <div>
        <div>
                      <h2>Why Mirror Sold</h2>
          
          <p>Last year, Mirror CEO Brynn Putnam told Fast Company she was building “the next iPhone.” Far from another connected fitness upstart, Mirror would be “the third screen in your life that you’re going to turn to for all immersive interactive experiences going forward.”</p>
<p>About seven months later, Putnam pulled the ripcord, selling her company amid a global pandemic — circumstances tailor-made for an immersive third screen.</p>
<p>So why did Mirror sell? lulu made an offer they couldn’t refuse. Putnam, a solo, female founder just secured a “W” for herself, her investors, and New York’s startup scene.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious, it’s fair to ask,&nbsp;<em>why now?</em>&nbsp;In many ways, Peloton forced Putnam’s hand.</p>
<p>Pitching Mirror as the “next iPhone” was a strategic move that 1.) established a big vision worthy of $70M+ in funding, and 2.) helped the company duck the question, “how do you compete with Peloton?” Their answer was simple — we don’t.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, Mirror was pigeonholed. They weren’t the third screen, they were in direct competition with Peloton. And despite surging sales, Mirror’s growth pales in comparison to Peloton’s. Plus, there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joevennare_fitness-startups-activity-6679025786697117697-YuI5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a growing list of Mirror-like competitors</a>&nbsp;hitting the market. All of a sudden, an interactive screen didn’t feel all that innovative, or defensible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, digital fitness companies are raking in funding. Hydrow, Aaptiv, and NEOU recently closed investments as Tonal and Tempo target new funds. If Mirror considered raising on the back of its COVID boost, they’d have to become a customer acquisition and retention machine, where every move is audited in relation to Peloton’s now public (and soaring) metrics.</p>
<p>In the end, joining forces with lululemon was more compelling than slugging it out with Peloton or adhering to the “third screen” narrative.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

            <div>
        <div>
                      <h2>Lulu x Mirror</h2>
          
          <p>Upon announcing the deal, lululemon’s stock jumped, and onlookers have been quick to heap on the praise.</p>
<p>According to Bank of America analysts, Mirror could generate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/lululemon-acquisition-mirror-could-generate-700-million-and-reach-600000-subscribers-by-2023-bank-of-america-2020-07-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$700M</a>&nbsp;in revenue and reach 600,000 subscribers by 2023.</p>
<p>To realize this lofty forecast, lululemon will sell Mirrors to its existing customer base, starting with its 489 corporate-owned stores across the globe. The retailer will continue creating content for the platform, where Mirror instructors will be clad in lululemon gear. More than simply selling more apparel, Mirror’s ability to generate recurring revenue and strengthen lulu’s relationship with consumers is the chief aim of this acquisition.</p>
<p>While the hard work of transforming an athleisure retailer into a tech company is just beginning, it will be difficult to criticize lululemon for shooting this shot. Whether or not they can keep growing will be the question on everyone’s mind:</p>
<p><em>“Lulu is showing no signs of slowing down, but acquisitions made outside a retailer’s core skill set have rarely been seamless. There is nothing bad about the story right now. The scariest thing [for investors] about Lulu is, is this as good as it gets?”</em>&nbsp;– Simeon Siegel, managing director &amp; senior retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets.</p>

                      <h2>💻 Closing the Gap </h2>
          
          <p>Teletherapy is gaining traction during the pandemic. It just might be the key to unlocking access for millions of individuals battling mental illness.</p>
<p>There’s a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider.fitt.co/wellness-startups-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shocking gap</a>&nbsp;between demand (those in need of care) and supply (access to affordable care).</p>
<ul>
<li>46M Americans report experiencing mental illness each year, while only 42.6% received treatment.</li>
<li>Individuals who are able to access care will wait an average of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/practice-management/long-wait-times-typical-for-psychiatry-appointments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 days</a>&nbsp;for an appointment.</li>
<li>With in-room therapy costing $150–$400 per session, plus the added cost of medication,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/mental-health-financing-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">45%</a>&nbsp;of untreated individuals cite cost as a barrier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;During COVID, the majority of therapists switched from in-person to remote therapy. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apaservices.org/practice/legal/technology/psychologists-embrace-telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>&nbsp;found that three quarters of clinicians are exclusively using teletherapy.

<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;The convenience and flexibility of remote care have proven beneficial, but concerns related to privacy regulations, insurance coverage, Zoom fatigue, and missing non-verbal cues leave a lot of room for improving the experience.</p>
<p>As consumer demand for digital behavioral health grows, investors are seizing the moment.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! 👋 Today we are going to understand the JPEG compression algorithm. One thing a lot of people don’t know is that JPEG is not a format but rather an algorithm. The JPEG images you see are mostly in the JFIF format (JPEG File Interchange Format) that internally uses the JPEG compression algorithm. By the end of this article, you will have a much better understanding of how the JPEG algorithm compresses data and how you can write some custom Python code to decompress it. We will not be covering all the nuances of the JPEG format (like progressive scan) but rather only the basic baseline format while writing our decoder.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Why write another article on JPEG when there are already hundreds of articles on the internet? Well, normally when you read articles on JPEG, the author just gives you details about what the format looks like. You don’t implement any code to do the actual decompression and decoding. Even if you do write code, it is in C/C++ and not accessible to a wide group of people. I plan on changing that by showing you how a basic JPEG decoder works using Python 3. I will be basing my decoder on <a href="https://github.com/aguaviva/micro-jpeg-visualizer/blob/master/micro-jpeg-visualizer.py">this</a> MIT licensed code but will be heavily modifying it for increased readability and ease of understanding. You can find the modified code for this article on my  <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/Baseline-JPEG-Decoder">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="different-parts-of-a-jpeg">Different parts of a JPEG</h2>

<p>Let’s start with this nice image by <a href="https://twitter.com/angealbertini">Ange Albertini</a>. It lists all different parts of a simple JPEG file. Take a look at it. We will be exploring each segment. You might have to refer to this image quite a few times while reading this tutorial.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bdc1363abbd5744200ec5283d4154e55143df86c/8c624/images/decoding_jpeg/jpegrgb_dissected.png" alt="JPEGRGB_dissected.png"></p>

<p>At the very basic level, almost every binary file contains a couple of markers (or headers). You can think of these markers as sort of like bookmarks. They are very crucial for making sense of a file and are used by programs like <code>file</code> (on Mac/Linux) to tell us details about a file. These markers define where some specific information in a file is stored. Most of the markers are followed by <code>length</code> information for the particular marker segment. This tells us how long that particular segment is.</p>

<h3 id="file-start-file-end">File Start &amp; File End</h3>

<p>The very first marker we care about is <code>FF D8</code>. It tells us that this is the start of the image. If we don’t see it we can assume this is some other file. Another equally important marker is <code>FF D9</code>. It tells us that we have reached the end of an image file. Every marker, except for <code>FFD0</code> to <code>FFD9</code> and <code>FF01</code>, is immediately followed by a length specifier that will give you the length of that marker segment. As for the image file start and image file end markers, they will always be two bytes long each.</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will be working with this image:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7344493a5ee7126f8286dd83ade191cab9e7f292/fbea3/images/decoding_jpeg/profile.jpg" alt="Profile"></p>

<p>Let’s write some code to identify these markers.</p>

<pre><code>from struct import unpack


marker_mapping = {
    0xffd8: "Start of Image",
    0xffe0: "Application Default Header",
    0xffdb: "Quantization Table",
    0xffc0: "Start of Frame",
    0xffc4: "Define Huffman Table",
    0xffda: "Start of Scan",
    0xffd9: "End of Image"
}


class JPEG:
    def __init__(self, image_file):
        with open(image_file, 'rb') as f:
            self.img_data = f.read()
    
    def decode(self):
        data = self.img_data
        while(True):
            marker, = unpack("&gt;H", data[0:2])
            print(marker_mapping.get(marker))
            if marker == 0xffd8:
                data = data[2:]
            elif marker == 0xffd9:
                return
            elif marker == 0xffda:
                data = data[-2:]
            else:
                lenchunk, = unpack("&gt;H", data[2:4])
                data = data[2+lenchunk:]            
            if len(data)==0:
                break        

if __name__ == "__main__":
    img = JPEG('profile.jpg')
    img.decode()    

# OUTPUT:
# Start of Image
# Application Default Header
# Quantization Table
# Quantization Table
# Start of Frame
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Huffman Table
# Start of Scan
# End of Image
</code></pre>

<p>We are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> to unpack the bytes of image data. <code>&gt;H</code> tells <code>struct</code> to treat the data as big-endian and of type <code>unsigned short</code>. The data in JPEG is stored in big-endian format. Only the EXIF data <em>can</em> be in little-endian (even though it is uncommon). And a short is of size 2 so we provide <code>unpack</code> two bytes from our <code>img_data</code>. You might ask yourself how we knew it was a <code>short</code>. Well, we know that the markers in JPEG are 4 hex digits: <code>ffd8</code>. One hex digit equals 4 bits (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> byte) so 4 hex digits will equal 2 bytes and a short is equal to 2 bytes.</p>

<p>The Start of Scan section is immediately followed by image scan data and that image scan data doesn’t have a length specified. It continues till the “end of file” marker is found so for now we are manually “seeking” to the EOF marker whenever we see the SOC marker.</p>

<p>Now that we have the basic framework in place, let’s move on and figure out what the rest of the image data contains. We will go through some necessary theory first and then get down to coding.</p>

<h2 id="encoding-a-jpeg">Encoding a JPEG</h2>

<p>I will first explain some basic concepts and encoding techniques used by JPEG and then decoding will naturally follow from that as a reverse of it. In my experience, directly trying to make sense of decoding is a bit hard.</p>

<p>Even though the image below won’t mean much to you right now, it will give you some anchors to hold on to while we go through the whole encoding/decoding process. It shows the steps involved in the JPEG encoding process: (<a href="https://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/Multimedia/node234.html">src</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7237dd0093b6a8070b2c927673fd73bc797561d2/33b0a/images/decoding_jpeg/encoding.png" alt="JPEG Encoding process"></p>

<h3 id="jpeg-color-space">JPEG Color Space</h3>

<p>According to the JPEG spec (<a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.872-201206-I/en">ISO/IEC 10918-6:2013 (E)</a>, section 6.1):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Images encoded with only one component are assumed to be grayscale data in which 0 is black and 255 is white.</li>
<li>Images encoded with three components are assumed to be RGB data encoded as YCbCr unless the image contains an APP14 marker segment as specified in 6.5.3, in which case the color encoding is considered either RGB or YCbCr according to the application data of the APP14 marker segment. The relationship between RGB and YCbCr is defined as specified in Rec. ITU-T T.871 | ISO/IEC 10918-5.</li>
<li>Images encoded with four components are assumed to be <strong>CMYK</strong>, with (0,0,0,0) indicating white unless the image contains an APP14 marker segment as specified in 6.5.3, in which case the color encoding is considered either <strong>CMYK</strong> or <strong>YCCK</strong> according to the application data of the APP14 marker segment. The relationship between <strong>CMYK</strong> and <strong>YCCK</strong> is defined as specified in clause 7.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Most JPEG algorithm implementations use luminance and chrominance (YUV encoding) instead of RGB. This is super useful in JPEG as the human eye is pretty bad at seeing high-frequency brightness changes over a small area so we can essentially reduce the amount of frequency and the human eye won’t be able to tell the difference. Result? A highly compressed image with almost no visible reduction in quality.</p>

<p>Just like each pixel in RGB color space is made up of 3 bytes of color data (Red, Green, Blue), each pixel in YUV uses 3 bytes as well but what each byte represents is slightly different. The Y component determines the brightness of the color (also referred to as luminance or luma), while the U  and V components determine the color (also known as chroma). The U component refers to the amount of blue color and the V component refers to the amount of red color.</p>

<p>This color format was invented when color televisions weren’t super common and engineers wanted to use one image encoding format for both color and black and white televisions. YUV could be safely displayed on a black and white TV if color wasn’t available. You can read more about its history on <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/YUV">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="discrete-cosine-transform-quantization">Discrete Cosine Transform &amp; Quantization</h3>

<p>JPEG converts an image into chunks of 8x8 blocks of pixels (called MCUs or Minimum Coding Units), changes the range of values of the pixels so that they center on 0 and then applies Discrete Cosine Transformation to each block and then uses quantization to compress the resulting block. Let’s get a high-level understanding of what all of these terms mean.</p>

<p>A Discrete Cosine Transform is a method for converting discrete data points into a combination of cosine waves. It seems pretty useless to spend time converting an image into a bunch of cosines but it makes sense once we understand DCT in combination with how the next step works. In JPEG, DCT will take an 8x8 image block and tell us how to reproduce it using an 8x8 matrix of cosine functions.  <a href="https://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-minimum-coded-unit.html">Read more here</a>)</p>

<p>The 8x8 matrix of cosine functions look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/97f11adca54888172fc19cef52e514ef0e8b46fd/1a72e/images/decoding_jpeg/cosine-funcs.png" alt="Cosine functions"></p>

<p>We apply DCT to each component of a pixel separately. The output of applying DCT is an 8x8 coefficient matrix that tells us how much each cosine function (out of 64 total functions) contributes to the 8x8 input matrix. The coefficient matrix of a DCT generally contains bigger values in the top left corner of the coefficient matrix and smaller values in the bottom right corner. The top left corner represents the lowest frequency cosine function and the bottom right represents the highest frequency cosine function.</p>

<p>What this tells us is that most images contain a huge amount of low-frequency information and a small amount of high-frequency information. If we turn the bottom right components of each DCT matrix to 0, the resulting image would still appear the same because, as I mentioned, humans are bad at observing high-frequency changes. This is exactly what we do in the next step.</p>

<p>I found a wonderful video on this topic. Watch it if DCT doesn’t make too much sense.</p>

<p>We have all heard that JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm but so far we haven’t done anything lossy. We have only transformed 8x8 blocks of YUV components into 8x8 blocks of cosine functions with no loss of information. The lossy part comes in the quantization step.</p>

<p>Quantization is a process in which we take a couple of values in a specific range and turns them into a discrete value. For our case, this is just a fancy name for converting the higher …</p></section></article></div>

<p>Managers who can’t code are an outdated artifact of corporate America circa 2005. The best managers that I’ve had spend ~80% of their time coding, architecting, or doing technical work that requires engineering prowess. If your manager thinks coding is “beneath” them then they need a dose of humble pie. Your organization would likely be better off without them.</p>



<h2><span id="But_Managers_Manage_People">But Managers Manage <em>People</em>!</span>
</h2>



<p>There is a long-running stigma associated with developers, that we are all geeks who can’t handle interpersonal relationships. Due to our code monkey nature, we need “people people” who can go to meetings for us and communicate our efforts effectively to the higher-ups.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" alt="introverted programmers are an outdated meme" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg 700w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert-300x184.jpg 300w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/joke-extrovert.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>While the above is still funny, it’s <em>outdated</em>. As the developer community has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, so too has the personality diversity amongst its members. In other words, it is<strong> not hard to find developers with the soft-skills </strong>necessary for management positions.</p>



<h2><span id="Managers_Should_Help">Managers Should Help</span>
</h2>



<p>I am a firm believer in the following:</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" alt="" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-300x150.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA-768x384.png 768w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1_cdTc7T-pGbt5RnX1e9ayoA.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>While the manager doesn’t need to be the most talented developer on the team, they must at least be technically literate. When a team member goes to their boss with a technical proposal, the manager should be able to give valuable feedback.</p>



<p>In this <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/12/if-your-boss-could-do-your-job-youre-more-likely-to-be-happy-at-work">study from Harvard</a> 35,000 employees from the US and Great Britain were polled about their job satisfaction, and metrics were gathered about what influenced their happiness at work. The results showed that the <em>single greatest influencing factor </em>on employee satisfaction was whether or not their boss was technically competent. I practice what I preach, so at the <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault app,</a> all engineering leadership will forever be responsible for pushing code.</p>



<p>Contrast the idea of a competent boss with the all-too-familiar experience of going to a <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">non-technical middle-management type</a> with an engineering problem, only to be stuck in a teaching session because the boss has never heard of a pub-sub system.</p>



<figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9e3a6f35f44188bad76c100f3560ce69.gif" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><h2><span id="Managers_Need_Empathy">Managers Need Empathy</span>
</h2>



<p>A good manager has empathy for those who report to them. If the boss doesn’t code or hasn’t written code in a long time, they won’t understand the daily problems that their team is faced with. A good engineering leader will not only understand modern problems, but they make it their role to actively seek technical solutions in an ever-changing innovative landscape.</p>



<h2><span id="INB4_So_the_CEO_needs_to_be_able_to_code">INB4: “So the CEO needs to be able to code?”</span>
</h2>



<p>No, but the CTO does!</p>



<p>I am sympathetic to the idea that the CTO will have plenty of business and product-related work to focus on, but they can’t let their technical chops slip. In order to run the engineering arm of an innovative company, the person at the top should have a firm mental grasp on the implementation difficulties. If this just means reviewing architectural diagrams and reviewing pull-requests so be it, but nothing beats hands-on engineering work to stay sharp.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yik_Yak" target="_blank">YikYak</a> was an anonymous social network that used your location to show you posts 5km around you.  Users of the app could create new posts and the people around them could view the posts and vote up or down.</p>



<p>YikYak filed a few patents for the tech that helped them achieve this. The patents mention segmenting users into buckets by their physical location. One modern tool we have to recreate this type of user segmentation is a data-structure called an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R*_tree" target="_blank">R-Tree</a>. </p>

<h2>Creating tables.</h2>



<p>Firstly you will need an instance of Postgres. It is easy to set up in Docker (I’ve detailed a post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://adamfallon.com/2020/07/08/postgres-in-docker/" target="_blank">here</a> showing how). </p>



<p>I am going to be using DBeaver for this tutorial but you could use psql or any other Postgres connector. Let’s creating a new table for our posts.</p>

<p>Ready to go – So below we have a simple example of table for storing new posts. I am using a split latitude and longitude to show how the extensions work, but you could also combine the two into a POINT datatype if you are planning to use a lot of columns.</p>



<pre>CREATE TABLE post (
	id int8 NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
	post_content text NOT NULL,
	latitude float8 NOT NULL,
	longitude float8 NOT NULL
);</pre>



<p>On executing that you should have a table you can start insert values into. </p>



<h2>Inserting posts.</h2>



<p>So let’s start out by inserting two posts, the first posted from 10 Downing Street, and the second from Buckingham Palace.</p>



<pre>INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'I absolutely love the Queen. I hope she thinks I am doing a good job.',
	51.5034,
	0.1276
);
INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'The new Prime Minister is a prat! I do hope he doesnt come over often',
	51.5014,
	0.1419
);</pre>



<p>Now let’s put another post in from an aspiring politics student who is located in Cambridge University (65 miles away). Now we have an outlier that won’t show up once we do location bound queries later in this tutorial.</p>



<pre>INSERT INTO post VALUES (
	default,
	'Day one of my politics degree. Shall be most fun to stalk the halls of Westminister in 4 years.',
	52.2053,
	0.1218
);</pre>



<h2>Installing Postgres extensions</h2>



<p>We would like to be able to stand in St. James park (a large park between 10 Downing Street and Buckingham Palace) and see the two posts close by, but not the one from Cambridge.</p>



<p>So how do we do that? Through extensions! Postgres enables users to incrementally add features that help us do new things with our data.</p>



<p>Once they are installed we can use the latitude and longitude of <em>51.5032, -0.1349</em> to create a new select query on our posts table.</p>

<p>You can install extensions in Postgres simply by running a query. The two extensions we need are <strong><em>cube</em></strong> and <strong><em>earthdistance</em></strong>.</p>



<pre>CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS cube;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS earthdistance;</pre>



<p>After executing those two queries, you should see them under the ‘Extensions’ tab in DBeaver.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="219" data-permalink="https://adamfallon.com/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10-24-18/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/adamfallon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18.png?fit=652%2C190&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="652,190" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/adamfallon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18.png?fit=300%2C87&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/adamfallon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18.png?fit=580%2C169&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/adamfallon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/adamfallon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/screenshot-2020-07-10-at-10.24.18.png?w=580&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<h2>Finding nearby posts.</h2>



<p>We can now use these built in functions from those extensions to show us the two nearby posts.</p>



<pre>SELECT * FROM post
WHERE 
	earth_box(ll_to_earth(51.5032,-0.1349), 50000) 
	@&gt; ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude);</pre>



<p>The earth_box function takes two parameters, a point (which is returned by the ll_to_earth function) and a value for the size of the bounding box we want which is in metres. </p>



<p>By using the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-geometry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">contains?</a> operator (@&gt;) we are saying we only want values in the table in the bounding box generated by the earth_box function.</p>



<p>When executing that query we will see the two posts we were expecting! Try increasing the bounding box range out and you will be able to see the Cambridge post.</p>

<p>So now we have a working example of how to recreate the YikYak location-based functionality.</p>



<h2>So…how?</h2>



<p>Okay so why did we need those extensions? Can’t we just take the world, split it into squares and determine which box a latitude and longitude falls into? </p>



<p>Thats what we would <em>like</em> to do – but there are complications caused by the fact that the world is a sphere. To find posts “in your area” you are querying to find straight line distances between two points, your lat-long and for each row in the database. In a sphere there are no straight lines. </p>



<p>There is a way to determine the distance between two points known as the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance#:~:text=The%20great%2Dcircle%20distance%20or,line%20through%20the%20sphere's%20interior)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Great-Circle distance</a>. Instead of using straight lines we use circles or curves known as geodesics. Through any two points on a sphere that are not&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point">directly opposite each other</a>, there is a unique great circle. </p>



<p>The earthdistance extension allows us to generate queries using the contains? operator from the cube extension to generate efficient distance lookups between points.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>One thing to note is that this query will do a sequential scan of the entire table, which can be slow once you get up to thousands of posts. </p>



<p>If you do decide to use this setup in your application you should create an index on the latitude, longitude to dramatically speed up queries. That would look like this.</p>



<pre>CREATE INDEX loc_index ON post USING gist (ll_to_earth(latitude, longitude));</pre>



<p>Postgres will then determine whether it needs to use this index to speed up queries. You can check if the index is being used by using a tool to view the execution plan when you run the query detailed above. If it says SEQ_SCAN it is not using the index. </p>



<p>And we’re done! If you’ve noticed any mistakes or improvements I can make please drop me an email at adam@adamfallon.com</p>

<p><!--block-->The Khmer Rouge was formed in 1968 as a revolutionary Communist party in Cambodia. It was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party">ruling party</a> in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea">Democratic Kampuchea</a> was the name of the state as controlled by the government of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.</p>
<p><!--block-->The four-year period cost approximately 2 million lives through the combined result of political executions, disease, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation">starvation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfree_labor">forced labor</a>. Due to the large numbers, the deaths during the rule of the Khmer Rouge are commonly known as the Cambodian Holocaust or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide">Cambodian genocide</a>. The Khmer Rouge took power at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Civil_War">Cambodian Civil War</a> and were only toppled after the invasion of Cambodia by the neighboring Socialist Republic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_War">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</a>.</p>
<h2>Pol Pot and the Revolution</h2>

<p><!--block-->Saloth Sar was born on 19 May 1925, the eighth of nine children and the second of three sons to Pen Saloth and Sok Nem. The family was living in the small fishing village of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prek_Sbauv">Prek Sbauv</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampong_Thom_Province">Kampong Thom Province</a> when Cambodia was still a French colony. Pen Saloth was a rice farmer who owned 12 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare">hectares</a> of land and several buffaloes; the family was considered moderately wealthy by the standards of the day. Although Pen Saloth’s family was of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Cambodian">Sino</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_people">Khmer</a> descent and Saloth Sar was named accordingly due to his fair complexion (“Sar” means white in Khmer), the family had already assimilated themselves with mainstream Khmer society by the time Sar was born.</p>
<p><!--block-->In 1935, Saloth Sar left Prek Sbauv to attend the École Miche, a Catholic school in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh">Phnom Penh</a>. He lived with his cousin, a woman called Meak, a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ballet_of_Cambodia">Royal Ballet</a>.In 1926, she bore King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisowath_Monivong">Monivong’s</a> son, HRH Prince Sisowath Kusarak. She was given the official title <em>Khun Preah Moneang Bopha Norleak Meak</em>. Saloth Sar stayed with Meak’s household until 1942. His sister Roeung was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concubinage">concubine</a> of King Monivong, so through the two women, he often had cause to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace,_Phnom_Penh">royal palace</a>.&nbsp; In 1947, he gained admission to the exclusive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Sisowath">Lycée Sisowath</a>, but was unsuccessful in his studies.</p>
<p><!--block-->As a student in Phnom Penh and later in Paris, Saloth was exposed to anti-colonial, revolutionary, and socialist ideas.&nbsp; He became increasingly radical, outraged by French colonialism, the poverty of his nation compared to France itself, and wealth inequality within Cambodia even after French granted the nation independence in the 1950s.</p>
<p><!--block-->Saloth was a founding member of the Khmer Rouge, a party dedicated to socialist revolution in Cambodia.</p>

<p>The Khmer Rouge’s ideology combined elements of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism">Marxism</a>&nbsp;with an extreme version of Khmer nationalism and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia">xenophobia</a>. It combined an idealization of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Empire">Angkor Empire</a>&nbsp;(802–1431), with an existential fear for the existence of the Cambodian state, which had historically been liquidated under Vietnamese and Siamese intervention.The spillover of Vietnamese fighters from the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>&nbsp;further aggravated anti-Vietnamese feeling. The Khmer Rouge explicitly targeted the Chinese, Vietnamese, and even their partially Khmer offspring for extinction; although the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cham_people">Cham Muslims</a>&nbsp;were treated unfavorably, they were encouraged to “mix flesh and blood”, to intermarry and assimilate. Some people with partial Chinese or Vietnamese ancestry were present in the Khmer Rouge leadership; they either were purged or participated in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>&nbsp;campaigns.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge’s social policy focused on working towards a purely agrarian society. Pol Pot strongly influenced the propagation of this policy. He was reportedly impressed with how the mountain tribes of Cambodia lived, which the party interpreted as a form of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_communism">primitive communism</a>; as a result, those minorities received more lenient and sometimes even more favorable treatment than the urbanized “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois">bourgeois</a>” Chinese and Vietnamese. Pol Pot wanted to remove social institutions and to transform the society into an agrarian one. This was his way of “[creating] a complete Communist society without wasting time on the intermediate steps” as the Khmer Rouge said to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>&nbsp;in 1975.</p>
<h2>Control of the countryside</h2>
<p>The Khmer Rouge advanced during 1973. After they reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Sar issued orders during the peak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season">rainy season</a> that the city be taken. The orders led to futile attacks and wasted lives within the Khmer Rouge army. By the middle of 1973, the Khmer Rouge under Sar controlled almost two-thirds of the country and half the population.</p>
<p>Internationally, Sar and the Khmer Rouge gained the recognition of 63 countries as the true government of Cambodia. A move was made at the UN to give the seat for Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge; they prevailed by three votes.</p>
<div>
<p>The Khmer Rouge took the capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh">Phnom Penh</a> on 17 April 1975, proclaiming this be Year Zero – all culture and traditions within society would be completely destroyed or discarded, and a new revolutionary culture would replace it.</p>

<h2>Societal transformation</h2>
<p>After taking power, the Khmer Rouge leadership renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge subjected Cambodia to a radical social reform process that was aimed at creating a purely&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_socialism">agrarian-based Communist society</a>.&nbsp;The Khmer Rouge forced around three million people from the cities to the countryside to take up work in agriculture. They forced many people out of their homes and ignored many basic human freedoms; they controlled how Cambodians acted, what they wore, to whom they could talk, and many other aspects of their lives.</p>

<p>The Khmer Rouge believed that parents were tainted with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalism</a>, so they separated children from their parents, indoctrinated them in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">communism</a>, and taught them torture methods with animals. Children were a “dictatorial instrument of the party” and were given leadership in torture and executions.</p>
<p>Society was divided into two categories. These were the New People – intellectuals, city-dwellers, minority people, and many of their own party members and soldiers who were suspected of being traitors – and the Old People – those who already lived in the countryside.</p>
<p>The lowest unit of social control, the&nbsp;<em>krom</em>&nbsp;(group), consisted of ten to fifteen nuclear families whose activities were closely supervised by a three-person committee. The committee chairman was selected by the CPK. This grass roots leadership was required to note the social origin of each family under its jurisdiction and to report it to persons higher up in the&nbsp;party hierarchy.</p>
<h2>The New People</h2>

<p>New People were treated as forced laborers. They were constantly moved, were forced to do the hardest physical labor, and worked in the most inhospitable, fever-ridden parts of the country, such as forests, upland areas, and swamps. “New People were segregated from Old People, enjoyed little or no privacy, and received the smallest rice rations. When the country experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">food shortages</a> in 1977, the New People suffered the most.</p>
</div>
<p>The medical care available to them was primitive or nonexistent. Families often were separated because people were divided into work brigades according to age and sex and sent to different parts of the country. New People were subjected to unending political indoctrination and could be executed without trial.</p>
<p>One of their mottos in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People">New People</a> was: “To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss.”</p>
<p>The situation of the Old People under Khmer Rouge rule was more ambiguous. Refugee interviews reveal cases in which villagers were treated as harshly as the New People, enduring forced labor, indoctrination, the separation of children from parents, and executions; however, they were generally allowed to remain in their native villages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Life Under the Khmer Rouge</h2>
<div>
<p>Once in power, the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from all foreign influences, closing schools, hospitals, and factories, abolishing banking, finance, and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property">private property</a> and relocating people from urban areas to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farm">collective farms</a> where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn all Cambodians into Old People through agricultural labor.</p>

<p>In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(domicile)">residents</a> that they would be moved only about “two or three kilometers” outside the city and would return in “two or three days”. Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the “threat of American bombing” and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would “take care of everything” until they returned. People who refused to evacuate would have their homes burned to the ground and would be killed immediately. The evacuees were sent on long marches to the countryside, which killed thousands of children, elderly people, and sick people.These were not the first evacuations of civilian populations by the Khmer Rouge; similar evacuations of populations without possessions had been occurring on a smaller scale since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The entire population was forced to become farmers in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_camp">labor camps</a>. Cambodians were expected to produce three tons of rice per hectare; before the Khmer Rouge era, the average was only one ton per hectare. The total lack of agricultural knowledge by the former city dwellers made <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine">famine</a> inevitable. Rural dwellers were often unsympathetic or too frightened to assist them. Such acts …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a>, the world's premiere 48 hour solo gamejam, occurred back in April.</p>
<p>Ludum Dare has two tracks: the 'Compo' and the 'Jam'.</p>
<p>The rules of the Compo require you to make a game (other than source code) within 48 hours. At the end your fellow entrants will rate your game and your game will be ranked against your peers.</p>
<p>With everyone quarantined at home due to Coronavirus this April's Ludum Dare had vastly more entrants than usual. A total of 1383 people entered the Compo and there were 3576 entries to the Jam. That's an absurd amount of games!</p>
<p>I've entered the Compo a <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/blueberry-bounce">few</a> <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/noahs-help-1">times</a> using Unity, but this time around I wanted to write a game purely with the relatively new programming language Rust.</p>
<p>This post started out focused on the experience of using Rust, but turned into a general overview of the technical and design process for the game.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a 'systems programming language' focused on performance and safety. 'Safety' means that Rust helps you avoid certain classes of vulnerabilities and crashes. I have been using Rust for my personal work and decided now was the time to give it a shot for a gamejam.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-unity">Why not Unity?</h2>
<p>I've entered at least five past Ludum Dares with Unity, and Unity with C# is by far the most common set of tools used for Ludum Dare. But I just simply haven't been enjoying Unity as much recently.</p>
<p>Unity is a giant game engine, but I find it hard to get into a flow state with. There are too many knobs, features, and ways to do things. It's easy to flip a bunch of switches and have something decent, but that just doesn't mesh with my personal design flow. I prefer to work in a clean mental environment, not a complex editor.</p>
<p>Additionally Unity's WebGL build takes around 20 minutes on my laptop, which is absolutely miserable.</p>

<p>I've been coding exclusively on a 2016 Macbook Pro for a while now. It's not the best, but not the worst.</p>
<p>I could have used an existing Rust game engine, but I'm not familiar with the popular ones. Instead I cobbled together a mix of Rust libraries and various personal Rust scripts.</p>
<p>Rust makes it trivially easy to use other libraries (which it calls crates) through its package manager <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.</p>
<p>For this project I used the following crates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kettle11/kApp">kApp</a> My personal windowing and input library designed to build super fast.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a> The Rust ecosystem's standard way to call Javascript from Rust</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/grovesNL/glow">glow</a> "GL on whatever" A wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL.</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommended way to work with Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm) is through a command line tool called <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>. I skipped using <code>wasm-pack</code> and instead just used a two line bash script that would run a Rust build and then call <code>wasm-bindgen</code> directly to generate the web bindings.</p>
<p>Quick iteration times are absolutely critical for a gamejam. The following tools were instrumental in attaining quick iteration times:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch"><code>cargo watch</code></a> ran the build script automatically whenever the code was saved.</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/devserver/0.1.0"><code>devserver</code></a> hosted the local web page and automatically reloaded it when a file changed</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code was configured to automatically save</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of <code>cargo watch</code>, <code>devserver</code>, and the Visual Studio Code settings meant that I could edit a value, like a color, in my Rust code and watch it change on the web page nearly instantly.</p>
<p>Typical Rust build times were around 1-3 seconds while working on this project, but sometimes they'd inexplicably go up to around 10 seconds. Rust is known for slow build times, and these quick iteration times were only possible by carefully choosing tiny crates. My goal was to always have the new build ready on the web page by the time I changed to the browser window.</p>
<h2 id="code-structure">Code Structure</h2>
<p>With only 48 hours best practices go out the window, but even still I made some early choices to help make writing new code as easy as possible. One of the key things I wanted to ensure was that if I were to declare a new variable, or load a new asset, that it would only have to be declared once. Many Rust frameworks follow a pattern a bit like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>Game </span><span>{
    </span><span>player</span><span>:</span><span> Player,
    </span><span>/* Other stuff */
</span><span>}

</span><span>impl </span><span>Game </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>setup</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>) -&gt;</span><span> Game </span><span>{</span><span>
        Game </span><span>{</span><span>
            player</span><span>: </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),
        }
    }

    </span><span>fn </span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>) {
        </span><span>/* Respond to user input and redraw here*/
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The above works fine in regular scenarios, but when you add a new variable like 'player' it needs to be declared in multiple places. Instead I used a structure a bit like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> player </span><span>= </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();
    </span><span>/* Other setup code here */

    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>/* Respond to user input and redraw here forever*/
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This let me declare a variable and use it immediately, no extra fuss.</p>
<h2 id="async">Async</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the above structure doesn't work on web. On Web the main loop must return control to the browser.</p>
<p>The way to get around this is to pass a closure that the browser calls when an event occurs:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> player </span><span>= </span><span>Player</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();
    </span><span>/* Other setup code here */

    </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>move </span><span>|</span><span>context</span><span>| {
        </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
    </span><span>});
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Rust windowing and input frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">Winit</a> use the above approach.</p>
<p>Another issue on web is loading assets. On non-web platforms it's simple to just wait for an asset to be done loading:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> wind_sound_handle </span><span>= </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>fs</span><span>::</span><span>read</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>").</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
</span></code></pre>
<p>On web the above isn't possible because it would prevent returning control to the browser. It's not appropriate to lock up while waiting for an an asset to return from a server, so all loads are asynchronous.</p>
<p>An approach like the following could be used in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> wind_sound_handle </span><span>= </span><span>fetch_asset</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>");

</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>move </span><span>|</span><span>context</span><span>| {
    </span><span>let</span><span> wind_sound </span><span>= </span><span>None</span><span>;
    </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw requests here */
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>loaded_asset</span><span>) =</span><span> wind_sound_handle</span><span>.</span><span>get_asset</span><span>() {</span><span>
        window_sound </span><span>=</span><span> loaded_asset</span><span>;
    }

    </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
</span><span>});
</span></code></pre>
<p>But that approach can lead to tedious bookkeeping, which is the opposite of what you want for a gamejam.</p>
<p>Instead I decided to use Rust's relatively new feature: <code>async</code>. Fortunately I had recently added <code>asyc</code> support to <code>kApp</code>.</p>
<p>Rust's <code>async</code> feature generates a state machine for a function that allows it to pause and later resume when ready.</p>
<p>An <code>async</code> function can look very similar to a traditional infinite game loop:</p>
<pre><code><span>async </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>:</span><span> Application, </span><span>events</span><span>:</span><span> Events</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> wind_sound </span><span>= </span><span>audio</span><span>::</span><span>load_audio</span><span>("</span><span>wind.wav</span><span>").</span><span>await</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>loop </span><span>{
        </span><span>match</span><span> events</span><span>.</span><span>next_event</span><span>().</span><span>await </span><span>{
            </span><span>/* Respond to events and draw here */
        </span><span>}
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This let me load assets with one line and not have to worry about any bookkeeping. Perfect!</p>
<h2 id="game-design">Game Design</h2>
<p>The theme for this Ludum Dare was "Keep It Alive" which immediately struck me as overly morbid given the rapid spread of coronavirus. I couldn't motivate myself to create a game about death, and I nearly decided to quit the jam entirely.</p>
<p>Instead I looked for alternative ways to interpret the theme. As I stared out my apartment window towards San Francisco hills I thought about the way people droop their heads as they walk to and from work. It's a beautiful world, but it's tough to notice the beauty every day when the routine of life weighs heavy.</p>
<p>What if you played as a spirit to lift people up? You could keep their "wonder" alive. You'd play as some sort of spirit and perhaps you'd lift a commuter bicyclist up into the sky where you'd whisk them around and show them the stars.</p>
<p>I imagined you'd guide the bicyclist through the sky to collect stars and people on the ground would notice and point up in awe.</p>
<p>It was difficult to figure out how to pair that idea to gameplay, but what I settled upon was a game inspired by the old school flash game <a href="https://www.linerider.com/">Line Rider</a>.</p>
<p>You'd draw lines for the bicyclist and they'd roll along those lines and bump into collectible stars.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The plan was to implement the physics of the character as a rolling ball and then substitute in character art for the bicyclist.</p>
<p>The first thing I needed was line rendering. I ripped some code out of a prior Rust project that would generate mesh line segments by creating rectangles with circles at the ends. I wasn't sure if this heavy-handed approach to line joins would cause problems. Each individual line segment was made up of a bunch of triangles so I felt that perhaps the game would lag as too many lines appeared.</p>
<p>I stress tested this by scribbling the entire screen full of lines over and over, and I was shocked when the framerate didn't drop at all.</p>
<p>For the physics I took some math for finding the closest point on a line to the ball. If the point is inside the ball then check if the ball's velocity is moving towards the point. If the ball is moving towards the point then "bounce" the ball by pushing the opposite direction on the ball.</p>
<p>The heart of the collision code wasn't very long at all:</p>
<pre><code><span> </span><span>fn </span><span>check_lines</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>points</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>[Vector3]</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> len </span><span>=</span><span> points</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>();

    </span><span>for</span><span> i </span><span>in (</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>len</span><span>).</span><span>step_by</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>) {
        </span><span>let </span><span>(</span><span>distance</span><span>,</span><span> p</span><span>) = </span><span>point_with_line_segment</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>,</span><span> points</span><span>[</span><span>i </span><span>- </span><span>1</span><span>],</span><span> points</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]);

        </span><span>if</span><span> distance
            </span><span>&lt; (</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>radius </span><span>+ </span><span>LINE_RADIUS </span><span>- </span><span>0.001</span><span>/* Allow ball to sink slightly into surface*/</span><span>)
        {
            </span><span>let</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>= (</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position </span><span>-</span><span> p</span><span>).</span><span>normal</span><span>();
            </span><span>let</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>= </span><span>Vector3</span><span>::</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>normal_of_collision</span><span>, </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>velocity</span><span>);
            </span><span>if</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>&lt; </span><span>0.0 </span><span>{
                </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>velocity </span><span>-=</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>*</span><span> velocity_along_collision </span><span>* </span><span>1.4</span><span>;
            }
            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>position </span><span>+=</span><span> normal_of_collision </span><span>* </span><span>0.0001</span><span>;
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>(The code could have been a little cleaner had I known about the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks">chunks</a> method on iterators.)</p>
<p>I was pretty surprised at how great the ball physics felt without much tuning. When I started with this design the physics felt like a big unknown for me. I felt like I might not be able to get them right within the 48 hour window, but coding the physics was actually one of the shortest features in the project.</p>
<p>I was pretty concerned that the …</p></article></div>

<div id="post-body-8378966868534474355" itemprop="articleBody"><p>
It might seem a reasonable question, but it makes some terrible assumptions:</p><ul>
<li>lines of code = effort</li>
<li>lines of code = value</li>
<li>all lines of code are equal</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why did a fix that seems so simple when looking at the changes made take two days to complete?</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Because the issue was reported with a vague description of how to recreate it.</b> It took me several hours to get to a reliable reproduction of the item. Some developers would have immediately gone back to the person reporting the problem and required more information before investigating. I try and do as much as I can with the information provided. I know some developers don't like having to fix bugs, and so do whatever they can to get out of it. Claiming there isn't enough is a great way to look like you're trying to help but not have to do anything. I know that reporting errors can be hard, and I'm grateful for anyone who does. I want to show appreciation for error reports by trying to do as much as possible with the information provided before asking for more details.</li>
<li><b>Because the reported issue was related to functionality, I'm not familiar with.</b>&nbsp;The feature it was to do with was something I rarely use and is not something I've ever used in great detail. This meant it took me longer than it might to understand how to use it and the nuances of how it interacts with the software with the bug.</li>
<li><b>Because I took the time to investigate the real cause of the issue, not just looking at the symptoms</b>. If some code is throwing an error, you could just wrap it in a try..catch statement and suppress the error. No error, no problem. Right? Sorry, for me, making the problem invisible isn't the same as fixing it. "Swallowing" an error can easily lead to other unexpected side-effects. I don't want to have to deal with them at a point in the future.</li>
<li><b>Because I investigated if there were other ways of getting to the same problem, not just the reported reproduction steps</b>. One set of reproduction steps can easily make the error appear to be in one place when it may actually be more deep-seated. Finding the exact cause of a problem, and looking at all the ways to get there can provide valuable insights. Insights such as how the code is actually used, where there might be other places with possible (other?) problems that might need addressing, or it may show inconsistencies in the code that mean an error is caused (or handled) in one code path but not another.</li>
<li><b>Because I took the time to verify if there were other parts of the code that might be affected in similar ways</b>. If a mistake led to the bug, the same error could have also been made elsewhere in the code-base. Now's a great time to check.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Because when I found the cause of the issue, I looked to find the simplest way of fixing it that would have minimal risk of introducing side-effects</b>. I don't want the quickest possible fix. I want a fix that isn't likely to cause confusion or other problems in the future.</li>
<li><b>Because I tested the change thoroughly and verified that it addressed the problem for all the different code paths that were affected</b>. I don't want to rely on someone else to have to test that what I've done is correct. I don't want a bug to be found in the future and for me to have to come back to this code when I've mentally moved on. Context switching is expensive and frustrating. Having a dedicated tester have to look at the "same" change again is something I want to avoid whenever possible.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div><p>
I don't like having to fix bugs. Partly because they can feel like the result of a previous failure on my part. The other reason I don't like fixing bugs is that I'd prefer to be working on new things.</p><p>

What's worse than having to fix a bug?<br>
Having to fix the same bug repeatedly.<br>
I take the time to make sure any bug is totally fixed any time it is encountered so that it doesn't need to be faced, investigated, fixed, and tested more than once.</p></div>

      <p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/streaming-desk.jpg" alt="Stream software picture"></p>
<p>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at
live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable,
immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or
just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are
an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if
you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</p>
<p>This month marks the 6 month anniversary of the first stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/large__data__bank">LARGE DATA
BANK</a>, my Twitch live coding channel. It’s
grown from a one-off Friday experiment into a regularly scheduled part of my
life, a community of dozens of wonderful regular viewers and chatters, and
an activity that’s one of the top things I look forward to doing every week.</p>
<p>I’ve learned a lot along the way, and this detailed guide to the way I’ve
set up my stream is my attempt at stepping back and sharing those learnings in
the hopes of inspiring others to try this awesome hobby for themselves. I hope
it’s useful for you as you start your own journey into streaming.</p>
<p>If you have any questions that aren’t answered in this blog post, I’m more than
happy to answer them <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanALewis">on Twitter</a> or
<a href="https://jordanlewis.org/">elsewhere online</a>.</p>
<p>Also, please send me a follow on <a href="https://largedatabank.com/">Twitch</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/JordanALewis">Twitter</a> for stream notifications! I stream
every Friday at 3 PM ET, and most Sundays at some time in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Whatever your reasons for wanting to try streaming, there’s quite a bit of setup
that you’ll need to do up front to try it out that can feel daunting. Everyone
has to go through this initial setup period, though, and so can you. You got
this!</p>
<p>The most important part of this post is the
<a href="#obs-configuration">section</a> about
<a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>, which is the awesome, cross-platform, free and
open source streaming software that most of the community uses. OBS will be
your best friend on your streaming journey! You will use it to control your
webcam, desktop, audio, and every other element that goes into the final
product of your livestream.</p>
<p>The rest of the post focuses on configuration that’s more specific to Twitch.
I like to use Twitch because I like the culture that’s developed there over
time, but plenty of people think that YouTube Live is more appropriate for
professional content. I’m not too familiar with YouTube Live, but most of the
discussion about OBS should apply the same for YouTube as it does for Twitch:
the main difference is that you’ll configure OBS to send to your YouTube
account instead of Twitch in Stream settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Yo!</em> If you’re trying to set up your very first stream</strong>, you really
don’t need most of the stuff in this guide, which represents what I’ve built
gradually over the past 6 months, stream by stream. My recommendation for the
livecoding-curious is to try streaming with a bare-bones setup, to see how
you like it, before investing in expensive gear or diving into hours of
configuration and asset creation. You can accomplish this in several hours
over a weekend. Set up a single scene in OBS with your captured desktop as
the background and your webcam in the corner, with your microphone configured
under Mic/Aux. That’s all you need: a simple setup for streaming your coding
is now yours! I’ll cover how to make that happen below, in the OBS
Configuration section. Just ignore most of the extra scenes and various bells
and whistles, and you’ll be good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> is where you’ll produce everything that your
viewers can see and hear on the live video, including your desktop, the camera
with your beautiful face on it, your voice, and any stream alerts, overlays,
text, or other information that you might want to show to your viewers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktop2.png" alt="Desktop"></p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover with OBS and I’m not going to try to explain all of it,
so I’ll just talk about what’s worked for me. To make something that suits you,
you’ll need to flex your creative muscles! You can use the ideas here as a
starting place, but you’ll need to dive into OBS and play around: everyone’s
setup is going to be different.</p>
<h2 id="scenes">Scenes <a href="#scenes" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h2>
<p>A <em>scene</em> is OBS’s name for a particular layout of video and audio components
on a stream. Typically, you’ll see Twitch streamers stay on a single scene for
most of their stream: their game, desktop, or whatever their focus is. But it’s
handy to have a few extra ones for the intro and outro to your stream,
something that covers the screen for when you want to take a break, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/scenes.png" alt="Scenes popped out"></p>
<p>I have the main scenes that I use bound to global hotkeys, so I can switch
between them without having to click around in OBS. Unfortunately, sometimes
the hotkeys stop working during the stream - I’ve yet to figure out exactly why
this happens. If you happen to have this same problem and have found a
workaround, please let me know!</p>
<p>I have 6 primary scenes, and a couple of child scenes that are embedded in
several main scenes to deduplicate on-screen elements (the ones below the
<code>-----</code> in the picture). However, I spend the vast majority of my stream on one
of them: the Desktop scene.</p>
<h3 id="desktop">Desktop <a href="#desktop" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This scene is the workhorse of the stream, and the one that’s active 95% of the
time. It consists of a full-screen, 1080p Display Capture source of my external
monitor. This is convenient because it leaves no ambiguity about what’s catpured
on the stream (it’s the whole monitor) and leaves my laptop screen free for
the OBS window, monitoring chat, and anything else that I want to look at while
streaming without having to show my viewers.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020">Desktop setup post</a> goes into more detail about the
way that I’ve set up my desk to have two monitors. It’s so convenient for the
stream that I’m hooked, and I’m not sure how I’d manage without.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktopscene.png" alt="Desktop Scene in OBS"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick note on font size: you have to make your text editor font quite large
to make it legible for your viewers! It will take a little while to get used
to this. I use 26-point font in my editor, which provides only about 30
visible horizontal lines of code. This is next to nothing compared to the
amount of context you’re probably used to seeing while programming. This
hamstringing is worth it, though: the bigger your font, the more likely it is
that your viewers will be able to follow along with what you’re doing, stay
engaged, ask questions, learn, and have fun.</p>
<p>You should also try to remove as many distracting elements from your editor
and desktop as possible while streaming, to keep the focus on the code. For
me, this has meant disabling the Mac’s menubar and Dock, and removing the
vast majority of toolbars from my IDE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the desktop capture source, which is at the back of the scene, I’ve
added several other sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Face cam, which is a video source from my capture card (more information about the video sources in the <a href="#video">Video</a> section)</li>
<li>Keyboard cam, which is a video source from a webcam pointed at my keyboard.</li>
<li>A couple of text boxes, to show my most recent subscriber, follower, and
some on-stream commands. The text boxes are updated automatically by the
<a href="https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/streamlabels">StreamLabels</a> app.</li>
<li>A web page source connected to Streamlabs Stream Alerts, which I’ll cover <a href="#stream-alerts">below</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I definitely didn’t start with all of these elements - it’s quite a lot of work
to tweak things just the way you want - but I’ve kept this configuration for the
past couple of months and I like the way it looks.</p>
<h3 id="whiteboard">Whiteboard <a href="#whiteboard" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>The whiteboard scene is meant to showcase my iPad full screen, allowing me to
draw things on stream to demonstrate ideas or concepts. I use the Concepts app
on the iPad along with an Apple Pencil for drawing, and it works pretty nicely.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/whiteboard.png" alt="Whiteboard scene"></p>
<p>I didn’t know how to fill up the space on the bottom left, since the iPad
doesn’t have a widescreen aspect ratio like my monitor does, so I put a picture
that my friend Aileen drew of me to make the stream a bit more visually
interesting!</p>
<p>This scene references the same facecam and alerts source as the Desktop scene.
You can definitely use DRY principles in OBS, just like software - but it does
get tricky to keep everything de-duplicated.</p>
<h3 id="ipad-green-screen-overlay">iPad Green Screen Overlay <a href="#ipad-green-screen-overlay" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>I also set up a “green screen” configuration for the iPad that I can overlay
over any other scene with a global hotkey. This gives me the ESPN football
announcer effect during my stream: I can draw on my iPad, and the lines will
appear overlayed on top of whatever else I have on stream at the time.</p>
<p>This is probably the most complex video element on my
stream, but OBS makes it pretty simple to set up. I added a Color Key filter
with a black background on top of the raw iPad video feed, set my drawing app
to have a black background, and tweaked the Color Key settings in OBS until
things looked right:</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/colorkey.png" alt="iPad Color Key"></p>
<p>I don’t use this element as nearly as often as I’d like, but I think it’s
pretty neat. I recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4WJQmN1cSo">demo
video</a> of it if you’re curious for
how it looks - I also use it occasionally on the stream.</p>
<h3 id="selfie">Selfie <a href="#selfie" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This is just a full-screen version of the facecam. I copied the name of the
scene from <a href="https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21">@noopkat’s
blog</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/selfie.png" alt="Selfie scene"></p>
<p>I use this scene for “turn to the camera” moments, which I find really fun. I’ll
switch to the scene, look right at the camera, and talk for a bit before
switching back to the desktop view.</p>
<h3 id="starting-soon">Starting Soon <a href="#starting-soon" arialabel="Anchor"><i data-feather="link-2"></i></a> </h3>
<p>This scene goes on as soon as the stream turns on, until I’m ready to start
talking to the camera. I’ll usually start the stream a few minutes before the
time that I announced on Twitter for my stream, and leave it up until that time
comes (with a muted mic!).</p>
<p><img src="https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/startingsoon.png" alt="Starting Soon scene"></p>
<p>I used a gif I found on the internet of someone typing, so people can tell that

		<div><p><img alt="etcd icon" src="https://www.roguelazer.com/images/etcd-icon.png"></p>
<p>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> which was a really lightweight database written
around the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14">Raft</a> consensus algorithm. This tool was
originally written in 2013 for a <del>bullshit</del> unsuccessful project called <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/">CoreOS Container Linux</a> that was
EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd
provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with
a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store
behind them and it's absolutely a pleasure to work with.</p>
<div>
<p>Hello <strong>massive influx of new readers</strong>! I see that some <del>person who's out to get me</del> kind soul has
cross-posted this to Hacker News, Reddit, and a bunch of other sites. Cool! A few things you might want to know <em>before</em>
you send me hate-mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The word "rant" is right up there in the tags line. This is not meant to be a persuasive argument to the secret cabal
  that controls API design or a nuanced technical comparison article. It's just some off-the-cuff thoughts. Chillax.</li>
<li>If this didn't come across clearly enough in the article: <em>I think etcd is great!</em> I have written a bunch of tools and
  applications on top of it! I think it's a fantastic little dæmon and its API, even the new janky v3 API, is still a
  million times better than ZooKeeper</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, then. Read on.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2015, an unrelated tool called <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> was released by Google (but, really, by
Xooglers). I would go so far as to say that Kubernetes (or, as the "cool kids" say, <kbd>k8s</kbd>) is the worst thing to happen to system administration
since <a href="https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/03/systemd/">systemd</a>. It's a comprehensive suite that promises to simplify operating clusters of software and give something like 
the experience of Google's <kbd>borg</kbd> cluster manager. What it really does is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add hundreds of new failure modes to your software</li>
<li>Move you from writing portable software configuration to writing thousands of lines of k8s-specific YAML</li>
<li>Ensnare you in a mesh of questionably-good<sup id="fnref:questionably-good"><a href="#fn:questionably-good">1</a></sup> patterns like containerization and software defined networking</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are running a truly enormous system and want to have off-the-shelf orchestration for it, Kubernetes may be
the tool for you. For 99.9% of people out there, it's just an extra layer of complexity that adds almost nothing of
value.</p>
<p>I digress, though; this is a story about etcd. And, unfortunately, our stories come together because Kubernetes was
quickly changed to use etcd as its state store. Thus began the rapid decline of etcd.</p>
<p>With the massive influx of Kubernetes users came, of course, a large number of Xooglers who decided to infect etcd with
Google technologies, as is their way<sup id="fnref:infection"><a href="#fn:infection">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:who"><a href="#fn:who">3</a></sup>. Etcd's simple HTTP API was replaced by a "gRPC"<sup id="fnref:grpc"><a href="#fn:grpc">4</a></sup> version; the
simple internal data model was replaced by a dense and non-orthogonal data model with different types for leases, locks,
transactions, and plain-old-keys. etcd 3.2 added back a tiny subset of the HTTP API through the <a href="https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway/">"gRPC
Gateway"</a>, but not enough to implement
any of the rich applications built on top of the original API. The v2 API lives on for now, but upstream threatens to
remove it in every new version and there will surely come a time when it'll be removed entirely.</p>
<p>That's it. That's the story. Popular modern technology is taken over by expats from a megacorp and made worse in the
service of a hyper-specialized (and just plain over-hyped) orchestration platform. That's the world today. Anything that
has a simple and elegant feature-set ends up coöpted by people who just want to build big ungainly architecture and ends
up inheriting features from whatever megacorp the coöpters came from<sup id="fnref:megacorp"><a href="#fn:megacorp">9</a></sup>. The software development world would
prefer to use their multi-gigabyte IDEs running on ElectronJS to build thousand-dependency Java applications targeting
ungainly APIs on hard-to-operate systems than support something simpler and better. Quality is, alas, a dying art.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5f0dca0caa6bc4150907a76b"><div><p>Dear A.G.,</p><p>It is with sadness that I write to tell you that I am resigning from The New York Times.&nbsp;</p><p>I joined the paper with gratitude and optimism three years ago. I was hired with the goal of bringing in voices that would not otherwise appear in your pages: first-time writers, centrists, conservatives and others who would not naturally think of The Times as their home. The reason for this effort was clear: The paper’s failure to anticipate the outcome of the 2016 election meant that it didn’t have a firm grasp of the country it covers. Dean Baquet and others have admitted as much on various occasions. The priority in Opinion was to help redress that critical shortcoming.</p><p>I was honored to be part of that effort, led by James Bennet. I am proud of my work as a writer and as an editor. Among those I helped bring to our pages: the Venezuelan dissident Wuilly Arteaga; the Iranian chess champion Dorsa Derakhshani; and the Hong Kong Christian democrat Derek Lam. Also: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Masih Alinejad, Zaina Arafat, Elna Baker, Rachael Denhollander, Matti Friedman, Nick Gillespie, Heather Heying, Randall Kennedy, Julius Krein, Monica Lewinsky, Glenn Loury, Jesse Singal, Ali Soufan, Chloe Valdary, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Wesley Yang, and many others.</p><p>But the lessons that ought to have followed the election—lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism, and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society—have not been learned. Instead, a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else.</p><p>Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor. As the ethics and mores of that platform have become those of the paper, the paper itself has increasingly become a kind of performance space. Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions.<strong> </strong>I was always taught that journalists were charged with writing the first rough draft of history. Now, history itself is one more ephemeral thing molded to fit the needs of a predetermined narrative.</p><p>My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views. They have called me a Nazi and a racist; I have learned to brush off comments about how I’m “writing about the Jews again.” Several colleagues perceived to be friendly with me were badgered by coworkers. My work and my character are openly demeaned on company-wide Slack channels where masthead editors regularly weigh in. There, some coworkers insist I need to be rooted out if this company is to be a truly “inclusive” one, while others post ax emojis next to my name. Still other New York Times employees publicly smear me as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action. They never are.</p><p>There are terms for all of this: unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge. I’m no legal expert. But I know that this is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not understand how you have allowed this kind of behavior to go on inside your company in full view of the paper’s entire staff and the public. And I certainly can’t square how you and other Times leaders have stood by while simultaneously praising me in private for my courage. Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.</p><p>Part of me wishes I could say that my experience was unique. But the truth is that intellectual curiosity—let alone risk-taking—is now a liability at The Times. Why edit something challenging to our readers, or write something bold only to go through the numbing process of making it ideologically kosher, when we can assure ourselves of job security (and clicks) by publishing our 4000th op-ed arguing that Donald Trump is a unique danger to the country and the world? And so self-censorship has become the norm.</p><p>What rules that remain at The Times are applied with extreme selectivity. If a person’s ideology is in keeping with the new orthodoxy, they and their work remain unscrutinized. Everyone else lives in fear of the digital thunderdome. Online venom is excused so long as it is directed at the proper targets.&nbsp;</p><p>Op-eds that would have easily been published just two years ago would now get an editor or a writer in serious trouble, if not fired. If a piece is perceived as likely to inspire backlash internally or on social media, the editor or writer avoids pitching it. If she feels strongly enough to suggest it, she is quickly steered to safer ground. And if, every now and then, she succeeds in getting a piece published that does not explicitly promote progressive causes, it happens only after every line is carefully massaged, negotiated and caveated.</p><p>It took the paper two days and two jobs to say that the Tom Cotton op-ed “fell short of our standards.” We attached an editor’s note on a travel story about Jaffa shortly after it was published because it “failed to touch on important aspects of Jaffa’s makeup and its history.” But there is still none appended to Cheryl Strayed’s fawning interview with the writer Alice Walker, a proud anti-Semite who believes in lizard Illuminati.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people. This is a galaxy in which, to choose just a few recent examples, the Soviet space program is lauded for its “diversity”; the doxxing of teenagers in the name of justice is condoned; and the worst caste systems in human history includes the United States alongside Nazi Germany.</p><p>Even now, I am confident that most people at The Times do not hold these views. Yet they are cowed by those who do. Why? Perhaps because they believe the ultimate goal is righteous. Perhaps because they believe that they will be granted protection if they nod along as the coin of our realm—language—is degraded in service to an ever-shifting laundry list of right causes. Perhaps because there are millions of unemployed people in this country and they feel lucky to have a job in a contracting industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Or perhaps it is because they know that, nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back. Too wise to post on Slack, they write to me privately about the “new McCarthyism” that has taken root at the paper of record.</p><p>All this bodes ill, especially for independent-minded young writers and editors paying close attention to what they’ll have to do to advance in their careers. Rule One: Speak your mind at your own peril. Rule Two: Never risk commissioning a story that goes against the narrative. Rule Three: Never believe an editor or publisher who urges you to go against the grain. Eventually, the publisher will cave to the mob, the editor will get fired or reassigned, and you’ll be hung out to dry.</p><p>For these young writers and editors, there is one consolation. As places like The Times and other once-great journalistic institutions betray their standards and lose sight of their principles, Americans still hunger for news that is accurate, opinions that are vital, and debate that is sincere. I hear from these people every day. “An independent press is not a liberal ideal or a progressive ideal or a democratic ideal. It’s an American ideal,” you said a few years ago. I couldn’t agree more. America is a great country that deserves a great newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this means that some of the most talented journalists in the world don’t still labor for this newspaper. They do, which is what makes the illiberal environment especially heartbreaking. I will be, as ever, a dedicated reader of their work. But I can no longer do the work that you brought me here to do—the work that Adolph Ochs described in that famous 1896 statement: “to make of the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.”</p><p>Ochs’s idea is one of the best I’ve encountered. And I’ve always comforted myself with the notion that the best ideas win out. But ideas cannot win on their own. They need a voice. They need a hearing. Above all, they must be backed by people willing to live by them.&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bari </p></div></div></div></div>]]>

July 14, 2020 | https://materialize.io/eventual-consistency-isnt-for-streaming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.io/eventual-consistency-isnt-for-streaming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streaming systems consume inputs and produce outputs asyncronously: the output of a system at any moment may not reflect all of the inputs seen so far. These systems provide various guarantees about how their outputs relate to their input. Among the weaker (but not unpopular) guarantees is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>. Informally, eventual consistency means if the input stops changing, the output will eventually arrive at the correct result.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll see that for as long as its input streams haven’t been stopped, natural eventually consistent computations can produce <em>unboundedly large and systematic errors</em>. If you are doing even slightly non-trivial computations, you should be prepared for your results to be <em>never-consistent</em> (a much less popular consistency definition). Until you pause the input streams and await correct answers, at least.</p>
<p>Not all is lost! There are stream processing systems that provide strong consistency guarantees. <a href="https://materialize.io/">Materialize</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a> both avoid these classes of errors by providing <em>always correct</em> answers, as do several other streaming systems.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid systematic and on-going errors in your results, you should probably check if the stream processor you use provides stronger consistency guarantees.</p>
<h2>Background on Eventual Consistency</h2>
<p>To quote from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">Wikipedia page on eventual consistency</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventual consistency is most often invoked for key-value stores, where each key tracks an independent value and one can reasonably imagine not updating the value associated with a key for long enough that the right answer might shake out. For example, if a database stores a map from people to their addresses, your update to your own address might not be visible immediately, but if you give it a few minutes it will probably sort itself out (if you don’t further update your address).</p>
<p>The requirement is only that folks stop updating a specific key, not that they stop using the database entirely. The rest of the world can keep reading out addresses, even keep reading out your stale address, and an eventually consistent system is obliged to eventually update your address (assuming you don’t keep re-submitting updates). Eventual consistency is a workable definition of consistency for key-value stores, where the vast majority of operations do not conflict, and one can reasonably expect to wait out any inconsistency.</p>
<p>Is eventual consistency a workable definition of consistency for streaming computations?</p>
<h2>Streaming computations</h2>
<p>There are many streaming computations out there. I’m going to focus on a class that lines up well with our study of consistency: incremental view maintenance. Incremental view maintenance is where you’ve defined a view, essentially a name bound to a query, and want to see the output answers change as the input data change.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve defined a query that could be applied to a static dataset, something like</p>
<pre title="">-- count the records in `data`
select count(*) from data
</pre>
<p>Now, the underlying <code>data</code> might change. As they do, we should produce the corresponding changes to the output. In this case, we would like to see how the <code>count</code> of the records in <code>data</code> have changed.</p>
<p>There are more complicated queries we might write. For example, this query determines the set of keys whose values are the largest among all keys:</p>
<pre title="">-- select keys with maximum values
select data.key
from data
where data.value in (select max(data.value) from data)
</pre>
<p>As <code>data</code> change, we would like to see the resulting set of keys track the maximum values</p>
<p>This next query determines the standard deviation of values for each key, and then selects out those values that are surprisingly large.</p>
<pre title="">-- determine average and stddev for groups
create view stats_by_key
select
    data.key,
    avg(data.value) as average,
    stddev(data.value) as deviation
from data
group by data.key;

-- select out surprisingly large values
select data.key, data.value
from data, stats_by_key
where
    data.key = stats_by_key.key and
    data.value &gt; average + 3 * devation
</pre>
<p>As <code>data</code> move around, the set of current outliers moves around too, and we would be delighted to be warned of them so that we can take some important action.</p>
<p>I don’t have strong opinions about whether these are exciting queries to compute, but we’ll use them as examples of streaming computations that can go surprisingly wrong. If your computations are more sophisticated than these examples, you might have even more to worry about.</p>
<h2>Eventual consistency in streaming: example 1</h2>
<p>What does a naive application of eventual consistency have to say about</p>
<pre title="">-- count the records in `data`
select count(*) from data
</pre>
<p>It’s not really clear, is it? Even if there were clear keys we are writing to, the thing we want to be correct is an aggregation across all of them rather than the value associated with a specific key. That result depends on all values. We could still extrapolate the definition of eventual consistency out to mean that if the input stops changing entirely, the system will eventually update to the correct count of records in <code>data</code>.</p>
<p>Although you shouldn’t expect to see this in the wild, an eventually consistent streaming system is certainly permitted to delay its processing as long as there are any outstanding input records that haven’t been processed yet.</p>
<p>This is actually not as unreasonable as you might think. Many stream processors intentionally batch up their inputs to improve their efficiency, and get started only once they get a moment of fresh air in their input stream. This technique allows them to improve their throughput during load spikes, by batching and re-ordering updates (for example, bundling all updates to the same key). It would be natural to see updates out of order, but taken to the extreme this technique results is no updates during the load spike.</p>
<p>While this is not necessarily something you’ll see in a professional stream processor, nothing about eventual consistency prevents behavior like this. So, while it’s not the most realistic reason to be worried about eventual consistency, it paints a bit of a picture about what we might need to watch out for.</p>
<p>Let’s ignore the possibility that a technically correct eventually consistent processor could produce no results, and instead look at what happens for more reasonable systems on continually changing input streams.</p>
<h2>Eventual consistency in streaming: example 2</h2>
<p>Let’s take the query that selects out the keys with maximum values:</p>
<pre title="">-- select keys with maximum values
select data.key
from data
where data.value in (select max(data.value) from data)
</pre>
<p>This is how you express “argmax” in SQL, and it is roughly equivalent to a join between the collections <code>data</code> and <code>select max(data.value) from data</code>.</p>
<p>A reasonable person might expect to see the keys with maximum values here, and have an eventually consistent system eventually show it some maximal keys. Some head scratching and you might walk that back to “any keys at all” because they might no longer be maximal at the moment you see them. But <em>eventually</em> we should see <em>some</em> keys, right?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>At least, not as long as the input stream is allowed to change.</p>
<p>Imagine the join between <code>data</code> and <code>select max(data.value) from data</code> receives its eventually consistent inputs consistently later for <code>data</code> than for <code>select max(data.value) from data</code>. This is not unreasonable, as it can be easier to maintain a <code>max</code> than to maintain an entire collection (<code>data</code>). As each record of <code>data</code> arrives, even those records with maximal values at the time of their submission may find that the maximum has advanced before they got there. They no longer match the maximum value, and are not produced as output.</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate this in <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow">Differential Dataflow</a>. We’ll have to fake some things out, because its consistency guarantees are unfortunately too strong. Fortunately, we can directly program transient delays in to the dataflow.</p>
<p>Imagine a collection that may have multiple keys in it, but we’ll only need one. We’ll increment the value associated with the key regularly (perhaps this is bandwidth used, or money spent, or most recent access, or …). Importantly, we’ll delay the update along one path by the gap in time between updates.</p>
<pre title="">// Global aggregation of values, on-time.
let input1 =
data.map(|(key,val)| ((),val))
    .max_by_key() // not real; should be `reduce(...)`.
    .map(|((), val)| (val, ()));

// Delayed map from values back to their keys.
let input2 =
data.delay(|t| t + 1)
    .map(|(key,val)| (val,key));

// Observe any results
input2.semijoin(&amp;input)
      .inspect(|x| println!("KEY: {:?}", x));
</pre>
<p>We’ll feed in changes that add elements to <code>data</code>, one at a time. Roughly like so</p>
<pre title="">(key, 1000)
(key, 2000)
(key, 3000)
...
</pre>
<p>The keys and values aren’t important, other than that the maximum increases. If the maximum increases within the time of the delay associated with the “eventual” nature of the consistency, we see no results:</p>
<pre title="">    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/examples/eventual`
Round 0 complete
Round 1 complete
Round 2 complete
Round 3 complete
Round 4 complete
Round 5 complete
...
</pre>
<p>Suffice it to say we didn’t see any <code>KEY</code> reports. We would, eventually, if we were to stall the input stream and allow one of the inputs to the join to catch up to the other.</p>
<p>What happens if we <code>delay</code> the <code>max</code> computation instead of the <code>data</code> stream? If the updates overwrite their previous values (<em>i.e.</em> if <code>(key, 2000)</code> overwrites <code>(key, 1000)</code>) then we also see no outputs, because by the time the maximum arrives the value has changed.</p>
<p>Eventual consistency is pretty badly suited to problem of aligning data, when the contents of either of those streams of data can be expected to move on. In our case, the maximum is regularly …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/loadzero/chopper258">chopper258</a> is a port of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/chopper-commando">Chopper Commando</a>, a DOS game written by <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,59219/">Mark Currie</a> using Turbo Pascal in 1990.</p>

<p>Some thirty years later, in 2020, I've dusted off the old code and breathed some new life into it. I've ported it to C and made it work with SDL2, and it can now run natively in modern environments.</p>

<p>The canvas below shows a minute or so of gameplay from the new version.</p>




<p>The game can also be played on the web, thanks to emscripten.</p>

<p>Let's do a quick check to see if you can play.</p>

<span>
    <p>Yes, you can play the game by <span>clicking</span> on the button below.</p>

    
    
</span>

<span>
    <p>Unfortunately, your browser looks to be incompatible. The game currently only works in Desktop Chrome, due to the use of certain low level features.</p>
</span>



<p>Thanks to Mark Currie for granting me permission to publish this translation of his game.

</p><p>In addition to publishing the <a href="https://github.com/loadzero/chopper258">source code</a>, and
<span><a href="https://blog.loadzero.com/demo/chopper258">playable version</a>,</span>
<span>playable version,</span> I am also writing a series of articles to accompany the
project, the first part of which is included below.</p>

<p>I have also made some animations and interactive parts that you can <span>play</span> around
with, such as the <a href="#picker_link">palette picker</a> later on in this piece.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I chose to revisit Chopper Commando for a few reasons.

</p><p>One of the biggest ones is nostalgia. I remember enjoying playing this game
as a child, on my PC and with others, and being surprised at some of the novel
mechanics. I also remember having a good laugh.

</p><p>This is the first game I played where you could leave a
vehicle, run around and do things on foot, and then get back in and keep going.
I thought that was so cool, and it was an early precursor to the sandbox games I
enjoy today.

</p><p>I have a soft spot for bedroom coded efforts like this, where the heart and
soul of the game isn't obscured by many layers of polish. It's not too hard to
imagine a 15-year old Mark Currie writing a game for himself on his 286, and
getting a real kick out of doing so.

</p><p>Games like this were pretty formative for me as a young aspiring games
programmer. Unlike something like Super Mario, which seemed unreachable to me at the time, I could play this and start working out how to make something similar, even with the simple tools I had.

</p><h2>Project Scale</h2>

<p>This was a bit smaller and more straightforward than my previous effort,
<a href="http://blog.loadzero.com/blog/si78c/">Space Invaders In C</a>. This project
took around 3 months of calendar time, and about 200 hours were spent on it in total.

</p><p>As the source code to the game was available, albeit in Pascal, not much
reverse engineering was required. Most of the effort went into the translation
to C, and building new code to provide workalikes for the Turbo Pascal API.

</p><p>One of the last parts I worked on, the sound, also turned out to be one of
the most difficult. The original game used PC speaker sound in a dynamic way,
and I had to write a synthesizer for it. It was quite fiddly to get the timing
right and make it sound like the original. More on that in part two.

</p><p>The original code is around 5500 lines of Pascal, all of it game logic code.
The new C version is around 5500 lines of game logic, 1500 lines of support
code and 400 lines of comments.

</p><p>Compared to the last project, there isn't too much behind the scenes
unpublished code in this one. I wrote a few small pieces to aid translation,
some scripts to build the font data, and some prototypes to help figure out the
sound code.

</p><p>I did end up writing a little bit of pascal code, mostly as temporary mods to the
original game source to help me figure out what the original system was doing. More
detail on compiling the old code is provided in a later piece.

</p><h2>Graphics</h2>

<p>One of the very first things I did on the project was to figure out the framebuffer format
for the original game, and start hacking to get it to display on a modern system.

</p><p>The frame buffer is CGA, meaning it is 320 pixels wide, 200 lines high and has
2 bit paletted color, for a grand total of four possible colors on screen at
any one time.

</p><p>Below is a selection of screen shots from the game in all their CGA glory.</p>



<p>If you look carefully, even though each screen can only show four colors, 
you can see that there are more than four colors in total. This is due to
palettes. In the CGA scheme, four base color palettes are available and each has a
different arrangement of sixteen possible colors.

</p><p>As an extra tweak, the first color in the palette (typically the background color), can be
freely chosen out of the sixteen, giving slightly more flexibility. This means that there
are sixteen variations of each of the four base palettes, giving sixty four palettes in total.

<a id="picker_link"></a>

</p><p>To play with the color combinations, <span>click</span> on the colored areas in the first panel below.
You can pick a palette and background color, and the effect will be shown in the second panel,
using one of the screenshots. Use prev and next to cycle to a different screenshot.

</p>


<p>In the old system, the framebuffer and the palette settings are bits of memory
that live on the graphics card and are twiddled by the game directly. In the
new system, these reside in host memory, and must be converted into a modern texture format
on the fly every frame for the GPU to use.

</p><p>Given that there are only 64 possible palettes, a neat trick can be used to
simplify and speed up the framebuffer conversion. Before the game starts
running, every possible combination of palette, background color and input
framebuffer byte (4 pixels at 2bpp) are iterated through, and the resulting 8
output bytes (4 pixels at 16bpp) are stored in a 16 * 4 * 256 entry lookup
table. Converting the framebuffer each frame is then just a matter of iterating
through each byte and performing a simple lookup and memcpy to stamp out four
pixels at a time.

</p><h2>To be continued...</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the sound code was one of the hardest parts of the port. Part two
explains why that was so, and the solution I used to solve it.</p>

<p>The canvas below shows a little preview.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This post appeared first on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/predictive-queries-vs-supervised-ml-models-ee7f17e4840e">Towards Data Science</a> in July 12th, 2020.</p></blockquote><p>One of the greatest trends in today’s technology landscape is the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/democratization-ai-means-tech-innovation/">democratization of machine learning</a>. Because the commodity state-of-the-art models, better tooling and better access to hardware: machine learning is becoming an everyday tool in the companies’ toolbox.</p><p>The ML democratization is still an on-going trend and given the disruption in this space it’s worth asking: where will this transformation take us? What the future of the everyday ML will look like?</p><p>Predictive queries are an interesting take on machine learning, especially in the ML democratization context. Solutions like <a href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/">MIT’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/probcomp/bayeslite">BayesDB/BayesLite</a> and Aito provide a way to get arbitrary predictions instantly with SQL-like queries. As an example, here’s a predictive query in Aito:</p><div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"from"</span><span>:</span> <span>"invoice_data"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"where"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"Item_Description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Packaging design"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"Vendor_Code"</span><span>:</span> <span>"VENDOR-1676"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"predict"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Product_Category"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>As such: the predictive queries seem like an easier, faster and radically different way to do machine learning. They give a glimpse of a future, where anyone can do machine learning as easily as one does database queries.</p><p>This article gives a brief introduction to the predictive queries, and it compares the predictive queries to supervised learning through 3 different aspects that are:</p><ol><li>The workflow, comparing the easiness and the costs between predictive queries and supervised machine learning</li><li>The architecture, comparing the high level differences between using predictive queries and using supervised models</li><li>And the qualitative properties (scaling, accuracy) as the quality is an obvious concern for an emerging, if promising, technology.</li></ol><h2>Introduction to the predictive queries</h2><p>Predictive queries resemble normal database queries with the exception that they provide predictions about the unknown, while the traditional database queries provide facts about the known. Here’s an example of the BQL (Bayesian Query Language) query done against BayesDB/BayesLite database:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-queries-in-bayeslite.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>Predictive BayesQL queries in BayesLite. BayesQL is based on SQL and it provides a very elegant way to query arbitrary estimates. This query can be executed after the CREATE POPULATION, CREATE ANALYSIS, INITIALIZE ANALYSIS and ANALYZE operations. </span></p></div><p>In essence, the predictive queries can provide a very SQL-like alternative to the supervised ML models with the key differences that:</p><ol><li><p>While supervised machine learning models need to be configured, trained and deployed before usage, the predictive queries provide instant answers after the database is prepared with data. As such: the predictive queries have a different workflow.</p></li><li><p>While supervised machine learning is always specialized for a single prediction from A to B, predictive queries can be used a) to instantly predict any unknown X based on any known Y and b) to provide also recommendations, smart search and pattern mining. As such, the supervised models are narrow, while the predictive queries are multipurpose, which has implications on the architecture.</p></li><li><p>While with the supervised machine learning the narrow models are explicitly formed train time, the predictive queries do multi-purpose modeling write time or narrow modeling during query time. As such: the predictive queries are technically more challenging.</p></li></ol><p>Only few solutions exist, that provide such predictive queries. One is the mentioned BayesDB/BayesLite, which creates an in-memory multi-purpose models in a special preparation phase. Another solution is Aito.ai, which does query-time narrow modeling without explicit preparations. Here’s is an example of the Aito workflow:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-queries-in-3-steps.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>Predictive BayesQL queries in BayesLite. BayesQL is based on SQL and it provides a very elegant way to query arbitrary estimates. This query can be executed after the CREATE POPULATION, CREATE ANALYSIS, INITIALIZE ANALYSIS and ANALYZE operations. </span></p></div><p>We are focusing the following comparisons on Aito. We feel this focus is justified as in Aito we are more familiar with the solution, and it is mature enough to serve the end customers in live production settings. While BayesLite is extremely impressive and their BQL interface and DB/ML integration are worth envy: BayesLite seems to have properties like the 16 minute preparation phase for simple data, which are not consistent with the presented arguments.</p><p>So let’s next dig deeper on the difference in workflow, architecture and quality between the predictive queries and supervised ML models.</p><h2>1. The Workflow</h2><p>The first difference between predictive queries and the traditional supervised models relates to the workflow and the costs.</p><p>Supervised ML models are deployed typically in data science projects, which have several steps like the handover to the data scientist, data preparation, feature engineering, model fitting, deployment, integrations, retraining and monitoring &amp; maintenance. As an addition to this linear progression, you also often have an iteration phase, where the results are improved by refining the data, the preparations, the features, the models, the deployment or the integrations.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-data-science-project-workflow.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>A simplified version of the data science project.</span></p></div><p>Taking a supervised model to production may take several weeks or months from one to two persons. This can raise the price point up to hundred thousand euros per model. If you need several models, you need several data science projects, leading to multiplied expenses and delays.</p><p>Now this process changes rather dramatically, if you implement the machine learning functionality with predictive queries. With predictive queries the workflow is in essence the following:</p><ol><li>Prepare the auxiliary <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-database-category-the-predictive-database/">predictive database</a> once (if it’s not used as the main database)</li><li>Verify good enough prediction quality with evaluate requests</li><li>Integrate the predictive queries like you would integrate SQL queries</li><li>Write the test/evaluation cases, push these to Git and let the CI handle the regression testing</li><li>If seen as necessary: track the in-production prediction quality with analytics and display the metrics in the product dashboard.</li></ol><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/pq-vs-ml-predictive-query-workflow.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>The workflow with the predictive queries is similar to the workflow with the database queries. Still, because predictive functionality is statistical and its behavior may drift as the data changes: it is advisable to verify the prediction quality (step 2) before implementation and monitor the prediction quality in production (step 5).</span></p></div><p>While putting an auxiliary database (like ElasticSearch) into production can take weeks, the expense related to putting each query into production is closer to the expense of using search/database queries. Often such queries form only a small part of the related functionality’s expense, and often the query based functionality can be implemented in hours and put into production in days.</p><p>This dramatic difference between the workflows and the expenses are explained a) partly by the <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-database-category-the-predictive-database/">predictive database</a>’s AutoML capabilities that are accelerated by a specialized database and b) partly by the reduced need for deployments and integrations as the data and the ML are already integrated into a single system. The complex phases of the data science project get systematically eliminated or simplified:</p><ol><li>The handover of the data science project to the data scientist is not needed as the predictive query workflow is easy enough for the software developers.</li><li>Data preparation and feature engineering steps can be greatly eliminated with the ML-database integration. You don’t need to re-prepare and re-upload the data, if the data is already in the database. You don’t need to manually aggregate data into flat data frames, if you can do <a href="https://aito.ai/docs/articles/utilizing-relationships-in-aito/">inference through the database references</a>. You don’t need to manually featurize text either, as the predictive database analyzes the <a href="https://aito.ai/docs/api/#schema-analyzer">text automatically</a> just like ElasticSearch. Last: you don’t need to manage feature redundancies, if the database has built-in <a href="https://aito.ai/blog/introducing-concept-learning-to-free-you-from-feature-engineering/">feature learning capabilities</a>.</li><li>Modeling phase can be automated with a single sophisticated model that provides good enough results for most applications.</li><li>Per model cloud deployment, live integrations and retraining of models simply disappear, because you don’t need to ‘deploy’ or retrain the predictive queries. Instead you integrate one auxiliary predictive database like you would integrate <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a>. If you use the predictive database as your main database, you can omit even that one integration.</li><li>Maintenance is easier, because instead of maintaining deployed infrastructure for each prediction target, you maintain the SQL-like queries like you would maintain code with Git &amp; CI.</li></ol><p>As a consequence, the workflow and the cost of implementing ML via predictive queries is similar to the process of implementing normal business logic via SQL.</p><p>The second difference between the predictive queries and the supervised models is the narrowness and it’s implications on the software architecture.</p><p>Famously: the supervised ML models are <em>narrow</em> in 2 different respects:</p><p>1.Narrowness of the prediction setting. Supervised learning models are essentially narrow functions from A (e.g. text) to B (category), which means that if you have 10 different problems, you end up with with 10 different supervised ML models.
2. Narrowness of the predictive functionality type. A single kind of supervised method can typically serve only one kind of predictions. For this reason you often need completely separate systems or products to implement predictions, recommendations, smart search and pattern mining.d up with with 10 different supervised ML models.</p><p>This combined narrowness has negative implications on the architecture. If you have 10 different predictive functionalities that mix prediction, recommendation and smart search use cases: you end up struggling with a very complex system. The system may include separate supervised model platform with half dozen deployed models, separate recommendation system, a separate smart searching product and separate pattern mining tools. Such complexity is hard to learn, master and …</p></div></div>

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>

        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>

          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>

        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        

<p>On a recent project we gained the ability to specify environment variables but not the process that was executed.
We were also unable to control the contents of a file on disk, and bruteforcing process identifiers (PIDs) and file descriptors found no interesting results, eliminating <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/goahead/">remote LD_PRELOAD exploitation</a>.
Fortunately, a scripting language interpreter was executed which enabled us to execute arbitrary commands by specifying particular environment variables.
This blog post discusses how arbitrary commands can be executed by a range of scripting language interpreters when supplied with malicious environment variables.</p>



<p>A quick read of the <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> section of the <code>perlrun(1)</code> man page reveals plenty of environment variables worth investigating.
The <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable allows specifying command-line options, but is restricted to only accepting the options <code>CDIMTUWdmtw</code>.
This unfortunately means that <code>-e</code>, which allows supplying perl code to run, is out.</p>

<p>All is not lost though, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HackerFantastic/exploits/blob/master/cve-2016-1531.sh">exploit</a> for CVE-2016-1531 by <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic">Hacker Fantastic</a>.
The exploit writes a malicious perl module to <code>/tmp/root.pm</code> and supplies the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-Mroot</code> and <code>PERL5LIB=/tmp</code> to achieve arbitrary code execution.
However this was an exploit for a local privilege escalation vulnerability and a generic technique should ideally not require access to the file system. Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty">blasty</a>’s <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-exim.sh">exploit</a> for the same CVE, the exploit did not require creating a file and used the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-d</code> and <code>PERL5DB=system("sh");exit;</code>.
The same environment variables were also used to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1dm8fv/hack_this_website_and_win_bitcoins_the_first/c9tm6j4/">solve a CTF challenge</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>One final nicety of a generic technique would be to use a single environment variable instead of two.
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">@justinsteven</a> found this was possible by leveraging <code>PERL5OPT=-M</code>.
While either <code>-m</code> or <code>-M</code> can be used to load a perl module, the <code>-M</code> option allows adding extra code after the module name.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-0: arbitrary code execution achieved using an environment variable against perl running an empty script (/dev/null)</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>--env</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`)'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl /dev/null
<span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>



<p>Reading the <code>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</code> section of the <code>python(1)</code> man page, <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> initially appears like it may be a piece of a straightforward solution.
It allows specifying a path to a Python script that will be executed prior to displaying the prompt in interactive mode.
The interactive mode requirement didn’t seem like it would be an issue as the <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> environment variable can be used to enter interactive mode, the same as specifying <code>-i</code> on the command line.
However, the documentation for the <code>-i</code> option explains that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> will not be used when python is started with a script to execute.
This means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> and <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> cannot be combined and <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> only has an effect when the python REPL is immediately launched.
This ultimately means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> is not viable as it has no effect when executing a regular Python script.</p>

<p>Other environment variables which looked promising were <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Both of these will let you gain arbitrary code execution but require you to also be able to create directories and files on the filesystem. It may be possible to loosen those requirements through the use of the proc filesystem and/or ZIP files.</p>

<p>The majority of the remaining environment variables are simply checked if they contain a non-empty string, and if so, toggle a generally benign setting. One of the rare exceptions to this is <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code>.</p>

<h2 id="making-progress-with-pythonwarnings">Making progress with PYTHONWARNINGS</h2>
<p>The documentation for <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> states <code>it is equivalent to specifying the -W option</code>. The <code>-W</code> option is used for warning control to specify which warnings and how often they are printed. The full form of argument is <code>action:message:category:module:line</code>. While warning control didn’t seem like a promising lead, that quickly changed after checking the implementation.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-1: Python-3.8.2/Lib/warnings.py</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[...]</span>
<span>def</span> <span>_getcategory</span><span>(</span><span>category</span><span>):</span>

            <span>raise</span> <span>_OptionError</span><span>(</span><span>"invalid module name: %r"</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span><span>module</span><span>,))</span> <span>from</span> <span>None</span>
<span>[...]</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>The above code shows that as long as our specified category contains a dot, we can trigger the import an arbitrary Python module.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the vast majority of modules from Python’s standard library run very little code when imported. They tend to just define classes to be used later, and even when they provide code to run, the code is typically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">guarded with a check of the <code>__main__</code> variable</a> (to detect if the file has been imported or run directly).</p>

<p>An unexpected exception to this is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">antigravity module</a>. The Python developers included an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/206e3074d34aeb5a4d0c1e24d970b6569f7ad702">2008</a> which can be triggered by running <code>import antigravity</code>. This import will immediately open your browser to the xkcd comic that joked that <code>import antigravity</code> in Python would grant you the ability to fly.</p>

<p>As for how the <code>antigravity</code> module opens your browser, it uses another module from the standard library called <code>webbrowser</code>. This module checks your PATH for a large variety of browsers, including mosaic, opera, skipstone, konqueror, chrome, chromium, firefox, links, elinks and lynx. It also accepts an environment variable <code>BROWSER</code> that lets you specify which process should be executed. It is not possible to supply arguments to the process in the environment variable and the xkcd comic URL is the one hard-coded argument for the command.</p>

<p>The ability to turn this into arbitrary code execution depends on what other executables are available on the system.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-perl-for-arbitrary-code-execution">Leveraging Perl for Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>

<p>One approach is to leverage Perl which is commonly installed on systems and is even available in the standard Python docker image. However, the <code>perl</code> binary cannot itself be used. This is because the first and only argument is the xkcd comic URL. The comic URL argument will cause an error and the process to exit without the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable being used.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-2: PERL5OPT having no effect when a URL is passed to perl</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>-e</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`);exit'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl https://xkcd.com/353/
<span>Can't open perl script "https://xkcd.com/353/": No such file or directory</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>Fortunately, when Perl is available it also common to have the default Perl scripts available, such as perldoc and perlthanks. These scripts will also error and exit with an invalid argument, but the error in this case happens later than the processing of the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable. This means you can leverage the Perl environment variable payload detailed earlier in this blog post.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/securitymb">Michał Bentkowski</a> provided a payload for exploiting Kibana (CVE-2019-7609). A prototype pollution vulnerability was used to set arbitrary environment variables which resulted in arbitrary command execution. Michał’s payload used the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc filesystem</a>, specifically <code>/proc/self/environ</code>.</p>

<p>Although Michał’s technique was creative and worked perfectly for their vulnerability, the technique is not always guaranteed to work and has some constraints that would be nice to remove.</p>

<p>The first constraint is that it using <code>/proc/self/environ</code> is only viable if the contents can be made to be syntactically valid JavaScript. This requires being able to create an environment variable and have it appear first in the contents of <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, or knowing/bruteforcing the environment variable’s name that will appear first and overwriting it’s value.</p>

<p>Another constraint, as the first environment variable’s value finishes with a single line comment (<code>//</code>). Therefore, any newline character in other environment variables will likely cause a syntax error and prevent the payload from executing. The use of multi-line comments (<code>/*</code>) will not fix this issue as they must be closed to be syntactically valid. Therefore, in the rare case that an environment variable contains a newline character, it is required to know/bruteforce the environment variable’s name and overwrite it’s value to a new value that does not contain a newline.</p>

<p>Removing these contraints is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders.

                        <p>The vast majority of serious malware&nbsp;<a href="https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsource_raid16.pdf">over the past 30 years</a>&nbsp;has been written in Assembly or compiled languages such as C, C++, and Delphi. However, ever-increasing over the past decade, a large amount of malware has been written in interpreted languages, such as Python. The low barrier to entry, ease of use, rapid development process, and massive library collection has made Python attractive for millions of developers- including malware authors. Python has quickly become a standard language in which threat actors create Remote Access Trojans (RATs), information stealers, and vulnerability exploit tools. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-one-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-planet/">Python continues to grow radically in popularity</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/malware-against-the-c-monoculture/">C malware monoculture</a>&nbsp;continues to be challenged, it would seem only certain that Python will be increasingly utilized as malware in cyber attacks.</p>

<p>In comparison to a standard compiled language like C, writing malware in Python comes with a whole host of difficulties. The first being that Python is required to be installed on the operating system in order to interpret and execute Python code. However, as we’ll see in the next section, a Python program can easily be converted into a native executable using a variety of different methods.</p>
<p>Malware written in Python will also have adverse effects on file size, memory footprint, and processing power. Serious malware is often designed to be small, stealthy, have low memory footprint, and use limited processing power. A compiled malware sample written in C might be 200 KB, while a comparable malware sample written in Python might be 20 MB after converted into an executable. Both the CPU &amp; RAM usage will also be significantly higher when using an interpreted language.</p>
<p>However, it’s 2020 and the digital landscape isn’t what it once was. The internet is faster than it’s ever been, our computers have more memory &amp; storage capacity than ever, and CPUs get faster every year. Python is also more ubiquitous than ever, coming pre-installed on macOS and most all Linux distributions by default.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows is still the primary target for most malicious campaigns, and it does not come with Python installed by default. Therefore, for threat actors to distribute their malware effectively they must convert their Python code into an executable format. There are many methods to “compile Python” into a native executable. Let’s take a look at the few most popular methods…</p>
<h3>PyInstaller</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png" alt="" width="500" height="100" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png 500w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>&nbsp;is capable of building Python applications into stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux, macOS and more by “freezing” Python code. It is one of the most popular methods to convert Python code into executable format and has been used widely for both legitimate and malicious purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple “Hello, world!” program in Python and freeze it into a stand-alone executable using PyInstaller:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
...

$ ./dist/hello 
Hello, world!

$ file dist/hello 
dist/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=294d1f19a085a730da19a6c55788ec08c2187039, stripped

$ du -sh dist/hello 
7.0M    dist/hello
</code></pre>
<p>This process created a portable, stand-alone Linux ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) which is the equivalent to an EXE on Windows. Now let’s create and compile a “Hello, world!” program in C on Linux for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
}

$ gcc hello.c -o hello

$ ./hello 
Hello, world!

$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=480c7c75e09c169ab25d1b81bd28f66fde08da7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

$ du -sh hello
20K hello
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how much larger the file size is: 7 MB (Python) vs 20 KB (C)! This demonstrates the major drawback we discussed previously about file size and memory usage. The Python executable is so much larger due to the fact it must bundle the Python interpreter (as a shared object file on Linux) inside the executable itself in order to run.</p>
<h3>py2exe</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">Py2exe</a>&nbsp;is another popular method to convert Python code into Windows EXE (executable) format that can be run natively. Similar to PyInstaller, it bundles the Python interpreter with your Python code to make a portable executable. Py2exe is likely to fall out of style with time as it has not been supported past Python 3.4, this is due to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#cpython-bytecode-changes">the bytecode in CPython being heavily changed in Python 3.6 and beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Py2exe utilizes distutils and requires a small&nbsp;<code>setup.py</code>&nbsp;script to be created to produce an executable. Let’s create an example “Hello, world!” executable using py2exe:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; type hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

&gt; type setup.py
import py2exe
from distutils.core import setup
setup(
    console=['hello.py'],
    options={'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1, 'compressed': True}},
    zipfile=None
)

&gt; python setup.py py2exe
...

&gt; dist\hello.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>hello.exe</code>&nbsp;created by py2exe is similar in size to PyInstaller coming in at 6.83 MB.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png" alt="" width="369" height="508" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png 369w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe-218x300.png 218w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></p>
<h3>Nuitka</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nuitka.png" alt="" width="120" height="24"></p>
<p><a href="https://nuitka.net/">Nuitka</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the most underutilized, and yet more advanced method of compiling Python code to an executable. It translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute code the same as CPython. Nuitka can use a variety of C compilers including gcc, clang, MinGW64, Visual Studio 2019+, and clang-cl to convert your Python code to C.</p>
<p>Let’s create a “Hello, world!” Python program on Linux and compile it using Nuitka:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ nuitka3 hello.py
...

$ ./hello.bin
Hello, world!

$ file hello.bin 
hello.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=eb6a504e8922f8983b23ce6e82c45a907c6ebadf, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

$ du -sh hello.bin
432K    hello.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced a portable binary very simply, and at 432 KB is a fraction of the size of what PyInstaller or py2exe can produce! How is Nuitka able to do this? Let’s take a look at the build folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ cloc hello.build/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C                               11           2263            709           8109
C/C++ Header                     1              1              0              7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUM:                            12           2264            709           8116
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced over 8,000 lines of C code from our 1 line Python program. The way Nuitka works is it actually translates the Python modules into C code and then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in the same way as CPython does.</p>
<p>This is very impressive, and it seems highly likely the Nuitka “Python compiler” will see further adoption as time goes on. As we’ll see later, Nuitka might have a further, built-in advantage in protection against Reverse Engineering (RE). There already exist several tools to easily analyze binaries produced by PyInstaller and py2exe to recover Python source code. However, by Nuitka translating the Python code to C it is much more difficult to reverse engineer.</p>

<p>Python malware can take advantage of a massive ecosystem of open-source Python packages and repositories. Almost anything you could think of, someone has already built it using Python. This is a huge advantage to malware authors as simplistic capabilities can be cherry-picked from the open web and more complex capabilities likely don’t need to be written from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three simple, yet powerful tool examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code Obfuscation</li>
<li>Taking Screenshots</li>
<li>Performing Web Requests</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tool Example 1 – Obfuscation</h3>
<p>Malware authors using Python have many libraries they could use to obfuscate their Python code to make code readability much more difficult, such as:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier">pyminifier</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor">pyarmor</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how&nbsp;<code>pyarmor</code>&nbsp;can obfuscate Python code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py 
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyarmor obfuscate hello.py
...

$ cat dist/hello.py

  <article>
  
  <p>Jul 13, 2020</p>
  <p>As many web platform developer and Firefox users, I believe <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla’s mission</a> is instrumental for a better Internet. In a recent <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/ecosystem-health">Igalia’s chat about the Web Ecosystem Health</a>, participants made the usual observation regarding this important role played by Mozilla on the one hand and the limited development resources and small Firefox’s usage share on the other hand. In this blog post, I’d like to explain an experimental idea we are launching at Igalia to try and make browser development better match the interest of the web developer and user community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">
    <img src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/open-prioritization.png" width="750" height="255" alt="Open Prioritization by Igalia. An experiment in crowd-funding prioritization.">
  </a>
</p>

<h2 id="igalias-contribution-to-browser-repositories">Igalia’s contribution to browser repositories</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the past in this blog, Igalia has contributed to different part of Firefox such as multimedia (e.g. &lt;video&gt; support), layout (e.g. Stylo, WebRender, CSS, MathML), scripts (e.g. BigInt, WebAssembly) or accessibility (e.g. ARIA). But is it enough?</p>

<p>Although commit count is an imperfect metric it is also one of the easiest to obtain. Let’s take a look at how Igalia’s commits repositories of the Chromium (chromium, v8), Mozilla (mozilla-central, servo, servo-web-render) and WebKit projects were distributed last year:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="374" height="305" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/distribution-of-igalia-commits-2019.png" alt="pie chart">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, the distribution of Igalia's contributions to browser repositories in 2019 (~5200 commits). Chromium (~73%), Mozilla (~4%) and WebKit (~23%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, in absolute value Igalia contributed roughly 3/4 to Chromium, 1/4 to WebKit, with a small remaining amount to Mozilla. This is not surprising since Igalia is a consulting company and our work depends on the importance of browsers in the market where Chromium dominates and WebKit is also quite good for iOS devices and embedded systems.</p>

<p>This suggests a different way to measure our contribution by considering, for each project, the percentage relative to the total amount of commits:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="436" height="339" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/igalia-commit-percentage-per-project-2019.png" alt="Bar graph">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, for each project, the percentage of Igalia's commits in 2019 relative to the total amount of the project. From left to right:
  Chromium (~3.96%), Mozilla (~0.43%) and WebKit (~10.92%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the WebKit project, where ~80% of the contributions were made by Apple, Igalia was second with ~10% of the total. In the Chromium project, the huge Google team made more than 90% of the contributions and many more companies are involved, but Igalia was second with about 4% of the total. In the Mozilla project, Mozilla is also doing ~90% of the contributions but Igalia only had ~0.5% of the total. Interestingly, the second contributing organization was… the community of unindentified gmail.com addresses! Of course, this shows the importance of volunteers in the Mozilla project where a great effort is done to encourage participation.</p>

<h2 id="open-prioritization">Open Prioritization</h2>

<p>From the commit count, it’s clear Igalia is not contributing as much to the Mozilla project as to Chromium or WebKit projects. But this is expected and is just reflecting the priority set by large companies. The solid base of Firefox users as well as the large amount of volunteer contributors show that the Mozilla project is nevertheless still attractive for many people. Could we turn this into browser development that is not funded by advertising or selling devices?</p>

<p>Another related question is whether the internet can really be shaped by the global community as defended by the Mozilla’s mission? Is the web doomed to be controlled by big corporations doing technology’s “evangelism” or lobbying at standardization committees? Are there prioritization issues that can be addressed by moving to a more collective decision process?</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.igalia.com/about/">Igalia</a>, we internally try and follow <a href="https://wingolog.org/tags/cooperatives">a more democratic organization</a> and, at our level, intend to make the world a better place. Today, we are launching a new <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">Open Prioritization</a> experiment to verify whether crowdfunding could be a way to influence how browser development is prioritized. Below is a short (5 min) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk">introductory video</a>:</p>

<iframe width="850" height="508" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I strongly recommend you to take a look at the proposed projects and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/#faq">read the FAQ</a> to understand how this is going to work. But remember <em>this is an experiment</em> so we are starting with a few ideas that we selected and tasks that are relatively small. We know there are tons of user reports in bug trackers and suggestions of standards, but we are not going to solve everything in one day !</p>

<p>If the process is successful, we can consider generalizing this approach, but we need to test it first, check what works and what doesn’t, consider whether it is worth pursuing, analyze how it can be improved, etc</p>

<h2 id="two-crowdfunding-tasks-for-firefox">Two Crowdfunding Tasks for Firefox</h2>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As explained in the previous paragraph, we are starting with small tasks. For Firefox, we selected the following ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CSS <code>lab()</code> colors. This is about giving web developers a way to express colors using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB color space</a> which approximates better the human perception. My colleague Brian Kardell wrote a <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Unlocking-Colors.html">blog with more details</a>. Some investigations have been made by <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205675">Apple</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1026287">Google</a>. Let’s see what we can do for Firefox !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SVG path <code>d</code> attribute. This is about expressing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571119">SVG path using the corresponding CSS syntax</a> for example <code>&lt;path style="d: path('M0,0 L10,10,...')"&gt;</code>. This will likely involve a refactoring to use the same parser for both SVG and CSS paths. It’s a small feature but part of a more general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--S_wgAJA">convergence effort between SVG and CSS</a> that Igalia has been involved in.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is this crowd-funded experiment going to work? Can this approach solve the prioritization problems or at least help a bit? How can we improve that idea in the future?…</p>

<p>There are many open questions but we will only be able to answer them if we have enough people participating. I’ll personally pledge for the two Firefox projects and I invite you to at least take a look and decide whether there is something there that is interesting for you. Let’s try and see!</p>

						I owe my interest in public education to Everett Reimer. Until we first met in Puerto Rico in 1958, I had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people. Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.</p><p>
						
						
						Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos, not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."</p><p>
						
						
						Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.</p><p>
						
						
						On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, I submitted the various parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and Jos? Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner, Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have appeared in The New York Review of Books.</p><p>
						
						
						Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp; Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.</p><p>
						
						
						I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries. </p><p>

						&nbsp;
						
						
						Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value. Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.</p><p>
						
						
						In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.</p><p>
						
						
						I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the nature of modern institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so, I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life, politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.</p><p>
						
						
						I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent chapters.</p><p>
						
						
						Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil. Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."</p><p>
						
						
						Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be born and to die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken care of by the institutional church. Now to begin andend life at home become signs either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the institutional management of doctors and undertakers.</p><p>
						
						
						Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.</p><p>
						
						
						The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<center><em>TypeScript — ARM  — August 2020</em></center>

<p><big><em>So, you’ve been trying to learn how compilers and programming languages work?</em> </big></p>

<p>Perhaps, you’ve learned about compiling to JavaScript,
or about building an interpreter? Or, maybe, about
compiling to bytecode? All good steps.</p>

<p><em>But there’s a tension building up.</em></p>

<p>Because it feels a bit like cheating.
Because you know that somewhere, somehow, the code you write
is translated to assembly instructions. To the machine language.
That’s where the rubber hits the road. That’s where it gets hot.
And, oh-so-many resources are hesitant to cover this part.
But not this book.</p>

<p>This ebook will show you in detail
how you can build a compiler from scratch
that goes all the way from <em>source</em> to <em>assembly</em>.</p>

<p>The example code is written in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, a dialect of <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
The book describes the design and implementation of a compiler that emits
32-bit <strong>ARM</strong> assembly instructions.</p>

<h2>Why ARM?</h2>

<p>In many ways, the ARM instruction set is what makes this book possible.</p>

<p>Compared to Intel x86-64, the ARM instruction set is a work of art.</p>

<p>Intel x86-64 is the result of evolution from an 8-bit processor,
to a 16-bit one, then to a 32-bit one, and finally to a 64-bit one.
At each step of the evolution, it accumulated complexity and cruft.
At each step, it tried to satisfy conflicting requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel x86-64 is based on <em>Complex Instruction Set Architecture</em> (CISC),
which was initially optimized for writing assembly by hand.</li>
<li>ARM, on the other hand, is based on <em>Reduced Instruction Set Architecture</em> (RISC),
which is optimized for writing compilers.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Guess which one is an easier target for a compiler?</em></p>

<p>If this book targeted Intel x86-64 instead of ARM, it would have been two times as long
and — more likely — never written.
Also, with 160 <em>billion</em> devices shipped, we better get used to the fact
that ARM is the dominant instruction set architecture today.</p>

<p>In other words… ARM is a good start.
After learning it, you will be better equipped
for moving to x86-64 or the new ARM64.</p>

<p><em>Will you be able to run the code your compiler produces?</em></p>

<p>I bet you will! The Appendix will contain a bazillion ways
to execute ARM code, starting from Raspberry Pi,
cloud VM, to various ways to emulate ARM on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>

<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

<p>First of all, you will be able to follow this book in any reasonable programming language.
For me, it was tough to pick one for this job, and I’m pleased I’ve chosen TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is probably nobody’s favorite, but it’s a good compromise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you coming from a dynamic language like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby?
Then if you close your eyes at the
type annotations, TypeScript is just modern-day JavaScript.</li>
<li>If you’re coming from Java or C#, then you will feel right at home,
since TypeScript
is brought to you by the same people who brought you C# <em>(and Turbo Pascal!)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if you’ve never seen TypeScript code before.
If you can read the following, you will most likely be able to pick it up,
as the book goes <em>(real code from the book here!)</em>:</p>

<pre><b>class </b>Label {
  <b>static </b>counter = 0;
  value: number; <em>// Type annotation
</em>
  <b>constructor</b>() {
    <b>this</b>.value = Label.counter++;
  }

  toString() {
    <b>return </b>'.L' + <b>this</b>.value;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I avoided using any TypeScript- or JavaScript-specific
language features in the code.</p>

<p>If you’re into statically-typed functional programming
languages (Haskell, OCaml, or Reason ML),
you will find that the class structure I used
has a nice translation to an algebraic data type.
It is, in fact, how I wrote it first.</p>



<h2>Book Contents</h2>

<p>The book consists of two parts. Part I
presents a <em>detailed</em>, <em>step-by-step</em> guide on how
to develop a small “baseline” compiler that can compile simple
programs to ARM assembly.</p>

<p>By the end of Part I, you will have a working compiler that can
compile simple functions like this one:</p>

<!--table>
<tr>
<td>


md5-73395652867122248e3299aa94c98c61


</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table-->

<pre><b>function </b>factorial(n) {
  <b>if </b>(n == 0) {
    <b>return </b>1;
  } <b>else </b>{
    <b>return </b>n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Into ARM assembly code like this:</p>

<pre>.global factorial
factorial:
  <b>push </b>{fp, lr}
  <b>mov </b>fp, sp
  <b>push </b>{r0, r1}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =0
  <b>push </b>{r0, ip}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>pop </b>{r1, ip}
  <b>cmp </b>r0, r1
  <b>moveq </b>r0, #1
  <b>movne </b>r0, #0
  <b>cmp </b>r0, #0
  <b>beq </b>.L1
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>b </b>.L2
.L1:
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>sub </b>r0, r0, r1
  <b>bl </b>factorial
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>mul </b>r0, r0, r1
.L2:
  <b>mov </b>sp, fp
  <b>pop </b>{fp, pc}
</pre>

<p>This code won’t win any awards, and an optimizing compiler
could do much better, but it’s a start!</p>

<p>Part II talks about <em>more advanced</em> topics in <em>less details</em>.
It explores several different (often mutually exclusive)
directions in which you can take your compiler.</p>

When I write blog posts I usually spent the first half
of the time writing the code and develoing the idea, and
the second half on the prose.
This book will be no exception.

At the moment I have finished writing
the code, and I am very happy with the results.
I expect the book to be ready early summer 2020, and a draft to
be available even sooner.

                        <blockquote>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - George Bernard Shaw</blockquote><p>I grew up in a family where I was taught to be likable. To please, to impress, and to make others happy. Seems like a pretty good idea, right?</p><p>While likeability is a good trait if you want to be popular it isn't ideal if you want to achieve. Let me explain.</p><p>Popularity feels good. Being liked feels good. Humans evolved as social creatures and we crave attention from each other. This pattern plays out over and over in schoolyards, bars, and workplaces, or anywhere humans meet. And the cooperation needed for our survival can only happen if you're accepted by your tribe.</p><p>However, praise by the masses won't make you successful, let alone fulfilled. Actually it's more likely that <em>popularity will prevent you from being successful.</em></p><p>Movie stars, professional athletes, and a business visionaries–we all want to be them. We grow up trying to be them. Personally, I've long idolized Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. But most of our heroes got to where they are by being unlikeable, not likable.</p><p>We love these men and women for being unique yet we internally berate ourselves for being different. These heroes have been described as annoying, difficult, stubborn, and unreasonable. Not exactly what we strive to read about ourselves in peer reviews. Sure, they have some popularity, but it's not all rainbows. Was Gandhi liked? Yes, but he also had millions of people who were against him, and ultimately murdered him. So if it's the oddballs that we look up to, why do we try to be so likable?</p><p>This aversion to difference starts early. Bullies throughout life pick on the kid who is different, on the easy target. Additionally modern culture has decided that the best path in life is to do as you're told; follow the rules, stay in line, and smile. Follow the leader and be a good girl/boy. The scripture of conformity is pervasive.</p><p>And there is true merit to fitting in. Society can't exist without collectively agreed upon rules. Early on we learn that being a three year old hellion is unacceptable has consequences. If I spit out my Cheerios one more time mom will be angry mom, so I'm going to be nice.</p><p>So we're taught to fit in. Be likable and hide your "flaws". Like the only white fish in a school of black fish you don't want to be the different one when a shark is on the prowl. Blend in and don't stand out. Seek group acceptance.</p><p>While conformity has its place in keeping society running, too much conformity stunts progress.</p><p>Differences are what make you, you and me, me. They're what make change possible. Change comes from differences, not from more of the same. After all, a species evolves based on small aberrations, on "flaws", that turn into strengths and a better way of being.</p><p>All progress comes from those who see the world differently. First they act differently and then they convince others to see differently as well. They don't accept the status quo and they don't assimilate.</p><p>Generally speaking this results in being unpopular. Many of the people who helped change the world aren't liked even in the height of their success. But they kept pushing their indomitable will against the world, and eventually, the world shifted ever so slightly.</p><p>Practice being unreasonable this week. Don't "yes" your way through life, following someone else's path for you. Be a bit more of a jerk. Be more demanding. Piss a few people off.</p><p>And be okay with it. Be okay with people being angry or mad or annoyed with you. Cultivate your ability to keep pushing towards your goals despite what others say.</p><p>And who knows, maybe you'll see the world shift ever so slightly.</p>

    <p>The human brain is a marvel of biological engineering. It allowed us to accumulate and pass on the knowledge of many prior generations throughout millennia, resulting in a civilization that went into space, taught computers to see and speak, and that continually discovers and investigates the laws of the Universe.</p>
<p>Its complexity is astounding, and we do not fully understand it yet. And because of that, occasionally, myths about the functioning of the brain pop out. Among the most prominent such legends is the one that claims we are dormant geniuses. But before analyzing and debunking that, let’s discuss some brain facts.</p>
<h2 id="size-does-not-matter">Size Does Not Matter</h2>
<p>For instance, did you know that the brain weighs around 1300-1400 grams? It represents only 2% of the total body weight of a 150 pound or 70kg human. However, it requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% of total cardiac output (the blood that flows in our body);</li>
<li>20% of total body oxygen;</li>
<li>25% of total body glucose utilization</li>

<p>That is quite an energy-hungry organ inside our skull! But even that fades away when comparing to children: at around five years old, the human brain takes up as much as 50% of oxygen consumption<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the brain’s level of oxygen consumption does not significantly vary when you are resting vs. when you do some cognitively intense work. Overall, measures of the whole brain changes in blood flow during intense mental activity have failed to demonstrate any change. Even <em>local changes</em> in blood flow of the regions involved most in a cognitive task are often 5% or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, it is well known and demonstrated that glucose is the brain’s “fuel,” therefore increases in blood glucose levels can positively impact cognitive performance in some tasks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-mystical-brain-myth">The Mystical Brain Myth</h2>
<p>There is a popular myth that we use our brains at only 10% of its capacity, thus boldly affirming that we have a whopping 90% of dormant potential that we can awaken and become geniuses.</p>
<p>Unlike other widespread myths that started from a single event, or unscientific claims from poorly designed research studies (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> and his fraudulent study than falsely claimed a link between vaccines and autism), the myth that humans use only 10% of their brains started at the end of the nineteenth century and was gradually strengthened by many people since then. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#Origin">Wikipedia</a> article on the subject has a lengthy explanation of the potential origin and evolution of the myth throughout the years.</p>
<h3 id="a-small-confession">A Small Confession</h3>
<p>Before moving on, I have a revelation to make. Occasionally, I might buy a cloth item and wear it once or twice. If I recall correctly, there might have been one or two items in my experience that I have not worn at all. Do you know anyone with similar oddities?</p>
<p>This makes my wardrobe much like the brain described in the myth: I am using around 10% of it, and I can “tap into” the rest of my wardrobe should such need arise.</p>
<h3 id="your-brain-is-not-a-wardrobe">Your Brain Is Not A Wardrobe</h3>
<p>But our brain is not a collection of cloth items. Though there are still unanswered questions regarding some brain functions, brain mapping physiology demonstrates that all its areas have a purpose. And you do not have to be a neuroscientist to prove that, simply recall from your anatomy classes that the brain has different regions, such as the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and the fact that each of those lobes has its role.</p>
<h2 id="debunking-the-myth">Debunking The Myth</h2>
<p>Let’s address that myth in a more scientific manner.</p>
<p>If we are using only 10% of our brains, that means a person would be fine if the other 90% of the brain got removed. 10% of the 1400g average brain is 140g—that’s the size of a sheep’s brain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Since I doubt sheep have their own 90% hidden potential myth, it makes no sense that humans have advanced so far as a civilization by using only part of their brains equivalent in size to a sheep’s brain.</p>
<p>There are instances in history when people were injured and got parts of their brain removed (although not as close as even 10%), the most prominent (and among the first recorded ones) being the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>, who survived an accident where a large iron rod was driven through his left part of the head, from the bottom of the cheek, through his left eye and frontal lobe all the way to the top of his head. He lived 12 years more after that accident. There are varying opinions on his recovery, but it took him ~10 years to recover from the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Another example is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Zasetsky">Lev Zasetsky</a>. A bullet entered his left parieto-occipital area and resulted in a long coma. Following this, he became unable to perceive the right side of things. Objects he did see often appeared as fragmented pieces rather than whole objects. He did not recover in the 50 years he lived after the injury.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn—The Brain Basics</a>, our brains can rewire through a process called <em>neuroplasticity,</em> which can help regain some of the lost functions as a result of an accident. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Researchers have found that only 27% of people recover from a <em><strong>concussion.</strong></em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> That means almost 3 out of 4 people do not fully recover! And this is “just” a concussion—your brain does not lose any of its parts.</p>
<p>If 90% of the brain were unnecessary, it is highly unlikely that we would not have evolved such big brains with irrelevant matter in the first place. There are several factors for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical risk of childbirth deaths due to the big skull size would stress out the selection of offspring with smaller brain sizes.</li>
<li>Natural selection favors characteristics that offer an advantage of some sort over the other. There is no way such a big brain would have formed in the first place if it wouldn’t be necessary for survival.</li>
<li>As already mentioned, the brain requires an enormous amount of energy. Even if we had 90% of the brain unused and suddenly were to “wake” it, we couldn’t provide our brains with enough power, as it already consumes 20%-25% of the entire body resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this scientific evidence works against this myth. We indeed use only some areas of the brain at any given time, but throughout the day, we use all of it, not just 10%. And next time you hear about this myth, recall the sheep brain weight.</p>

<h4><a href="https://petsymposium.org/2020/files/papers/issue1/popets-2020-0003.pdf"><strong>Discontinued Privacy: Personal Data Leaks in Apple Bluetooth-Low-Energy Continuity Protocols</strong></a></h4>

<p>We found that Apple devices are leaking sensitive information in the BLE wireless signals they emit. Those issues are associated with the Apple Continuity services and are affecting all Apple devices as well as devices compatible with the Continuity framework. Based on a reverse engineering of Continuity, we identified that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) messages emitted by Apple devices include unencrypted data that can expose sensitive information. We discovered that those data can be easily collected by an eavesdropper and processed in order to: track users, monitor activities in a smarthome, obtain phone number, email addresses and Apple Voice Assistant, Siri, commands, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png" alt="" width="822" height="385" srcset="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png 822w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-300x141.png 300w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>

<h2>BLE advertising</h2>
<p>In BLE, devices broadcast short messages, called Advertising Packets, to announce their presence and feature to nearby devices (those messages can be observed from an Android device using an application like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner&amp;hl=en">Ramble</a>). Advertising Packets can include the name of the device, its type, but can also include custom data in a field called Manufacturer specific. This field is typically used by vendors to transmit data for application. Apple make use of this field to include data for its Continuity Protocols.</p>
<h2>Apple Continuity Protocols</h2>
<p>Apple has developed a number of features, called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681"><i>Continuity</i></a>, that are designed to increase the usability of its products. Those features include: activity transfert, file transfert (airDrop), Wi-Fi password sharing, etc. The communication between nearby devices, required by Continuity services, is done by using BLE. Continuity data are embedded in BLE advertising packets and are broadcast to be picked up by nearby devices.</p>

<h2>Data exposed in cleartext</h2>
<p>We found that, even though some elements are encrypted, most of the data included in Continuity messages is sent in plain text. The exposed data can thus be passively collected by an eavesdropper and exploited to mount one of the attack presented below.</p>
<h2>Tracking users (iPhones, iPad, airpods …)</h2>
<p>We found that the content of <i>Apple Continuity </i>BLE messages can be used to track the device despite the use address randomization. We have identified several elements that remain constant over time or that can undermine the anti-tracking feature mechanism (i.e. address randomization). For instance, we found that messages emitted by earpods include information (battery levels and lid open counter) that can be exploited to track the earpod set. We also discovered a novel attack that would allow tracking by actively replaying BLE messages. An passive attacker could exploit this information to track the the location of individuals in spite of address randomization, the anti-tracking feature of BLE.</p>
<h2>Linking device belonging to the same iCloud account</h2>
<p>We discovered that it is possible to link together devices associated to the same iCloud account. This attack relies on the replay of messages that will trigger a response only from devices associated to the same <i>iCloud</i> account. An attacker could exploit this to identify all the device belonging to a person, and could narrow down its home if some device are left there.</p>
<h2>Monitoring activities in a smart home (Homekit)</h2>
<p>We found that messages emitted by <i>Homekit</i>-compatible devices can betray the activity in a smart-home. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"><i>Homekit</i></a> is a smart-home framework developed by <i>Apple</i> and found in <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit">devices</a> of <i>Apple</i> and other vendors (…). <i>Homekit</i> devices using BLE continuously emit messages that include an indicator reflecting the device state. For instance, in the case of a lightbulb, this indicator changes only when it is either turned on or turned off. Similarly, in an infrared movement detector, the indicator changes only when a person crosses the detection field. In-lab experiments showed that a passive attacker can leverage Homekit BLE messages to track the evolution of devices in a household and thus monitor the activities of the occupants.</p>
<h2>Device model, software version and more</h2>
<p>We found that a number of messages expose a wide variety of information on the emitting device characteristics and state: device model, OS version, device color, cellular connectivity, battery level, current activity etc.</p>
<h2>E-mail address and Phone numbers (Airdrop &amp; Nearby)</h2>
<p>We found that when using features such as Airdop and Nearby, devices emit messages from which email addresses and phone numbers can be extracted. Continuity services allow to seamlessly share resources with nearby devices: Airdrop to share files, Nearby to share Wi-Fi network credential. Prior exchange of information, the devices establish their identity by exchange identifiers over BLE: email addresses and/or phone numbers. Those identifiers are not sent in clear but are rather hashed using a cryptographic hash-function. This obfuscation can be bypassed in most cases and the identifiers recovered.</p>
<h2>Voice assistant commands (Siri)</h2>
<p>We found that when activated via voice, the Siri voice assistant will generate a message including a digital fingerprint of the command. Although the raw audio signal cannot be reconstructed from it, the fingerprint could be leveraged to infer the command.</p>

<p>The vulnerabilities identified were reported to Apple, Osram and Eve on May 29 th , 2019.</p>

<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>

<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

July 13, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One of the strangest phenomena in academia is the reliance on publishing
companies. In this article, I want to outline some of the issues that
arise when working with publishers. I shall also endeavour to provide
some solutions to improve this collaboration.</p>
<p>Before we start, a brief <strong>disclaimer</strong>: this article will use an
amalgamation of different incidents that involved either myself, my
colleagues, or my friends.  Names&nbsp;(of the publishing companies)
have been withheld because I do not think it fair to use my ‘soapbox’
without giving the <em>other</em> side a chance to respond. Moreover,
everything I write here pertains to publishing your research in
a journal. Conference publishing—at least in machine learning—is
a joy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Plus, there <em>are</em> good examples of journals for machine
learning papers, foremost of them the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of Machine Learning
Research</a>. The ‘adversaries’ in this article are
rather the ‘big’ publishing companies and their practices. With that out
of the way, let us take a look at the state of the art!</p>

<p>If you are new to science, at some point, you will probably have to deal
with an established publishing company to get your article published.
The deal usually works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You look for a journal you want to publish in and submit your article
to the journal. This already often involves jumping through some
hoops. Without knowing the eventual fate of your article, you often
already have to abide by certain arbitrary formatting guidelines or
completely ‘butcher’ your article for the submission<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> by shifting
content around. However, this can be all accepted and endured because
of course, you want something from <em>them</em>, i.e. a published,
citable publication!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journal then receives your submission—often through a web
interface that was developed with all the UX/UI knowledge of the
1980s<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and has <em>never</em> been updated since—and this is where it gets
slightly <em>murky</em>. Another person—typically the editor of the
journal—now decides whether to accept the paper for reviewing, or
whether to provide you with a desk reject. A desk reject usually cannot
be appealed. It just shows you the door and leaves you to try again
with another journal&nbsp;(more murkiness here). For early-career
researchers like Ph.D. students submitting their first paper,
this can be highly discouraging. I see the reason for reducing the
workload on reviewers, of course, but I also heard of academic feuds
that were carried out on the backs of Ph.D. students and their
publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming your paper ‘survived’ the desk reject, it will now be sent
to reviewers or referees. Their job is to review your paper
thoroughly, provide feedback, and in general give this whole business
a formal veneer. Setting aside problems in the reviewing
process—which I discussed <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/reviewing/">in another blog post</a>—this again opens up a portal into
a strange dimension: working as a reviewer for a journal is usually
a job that is provided for free&nbsp;(same goes for editorial
duties). Notice that this is <em>despite</em> the fact that those journals
are charging money to readers and universities. ETH Zurich, my
current employer, describes their experiences of the <a href="https://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Services/Using-ordering-resources/National-negotiations-with-publishers-Read-publish-reorganised">negotiations
with
publishers</a>
and mentions an expenditure of 6.4 million EUR&nbsp;(roughly 7.25
million USD) per year for being allowed to access journal articles.
That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>Setting aside the actual numbers here, let me just point out how
strange it is that companies are relying on <em>unpaid labour</em>, and this
reliance is <em>crucial</em> to their business model. They often do not
employ people that are qualified to judge the content that they want
to publish! But of course, reviewers and editors get the benefit of
<em>exposure</em>—that wonderful currency that is supposed to help your
career along! Even stranger: journals often charge hefty sums for
accessing your own research articles. To me, it is super weird that
research that is often <em>funded</em> by the taxpayer cannot be <em>accessed</em>
by the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supposing your article got sufficiently good reviews to be published,
the next stage of the process starts. This is where the <em>meddling</em>
begins in earnest. After a little back and forth, you article will be
changed according to some arbitrary rules: the last period of every
sentence in an image caption will be removed, footnotes will be put
into the text—because for some reason, footnotes are permitted in
virtually every template and publishing medium, but deemed somewhat
uncouth by certain publishers—and you might have to redo certain
parts of your paper because of subtle font changes or what have you.</p>
<p>Again, lest you think of me as a particularly cranky person prone to
grumbling and finding faults, you are getting the wrong idea here.
I do not object to these changes, but I <em>do</em> object to the fact that
these meddlesome changes often decrease the quality of your paper.
Here are some irksome changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Footnotes will be inserted willy-nilly into the text, regardless of
whether they make sense or not. That might break the flow of your
paper, but that is <em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ‘publisher house rules’ conflict with proper nomenclature in
a field. For example, the journal might have the ‘rule’ that all
fields in a table have to be capitalised. If this clashes with
nomenclature in your field, it is—you guessed it—<em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your equations will typically be typeset yet
another time for you<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which might introduce subtle changes: symbols
will change and you have to be go through your own paper once again
line-by-line to see whether anything untoward happened. Again, I am
primarily objecting to the substandard quality of this meddling:
the work that you put into writing your equations is completely
ignored, and now you have to chase—often very subtle—changes in
your own text. For mathematical typesetting, precision is crucial,
and it is unbecoming when people who do not <em>care</em> about this
precision create more work for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a last example, your figures might be meddled with: you might be
forced to convert them into obsolete file formats&nbsp;(because
apparently, EPS is still the best format available), or, more
appallingly, vector graphics might be converted to raster
images&nbsp;(judging from the experiences of my friends and myself,
this is unfortunately relatively common!). This might sound like a tiny
problem again, but it decreases readability and accessibility for
some readers, and, more to the point of this post, it is somewhat
unnecessary meddling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me re-iterate my main point: I do not object to changing my
paper, I merely object to meddlesome changes that are just generating
useless work. For example, there is no need whatsoever to typeset
your equations again—this is quite literally the definition of
negative work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you survived this ordeal intact, you now must <em>pay</em>. To be fair,
not all journals charge you for normal articles, but <em>most</em> of them
charge you for open access publishing. In other words: if I want my
research, which is generously funded<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by the Swiss taxpayers, to
be available to those selfsame taxpayers, I have to pay. The amounts
vary a little bit, of course, but we are talking upwards of a few
hundred USD at least. Luckily, this is <em>not</em> a problem for my
research group; my postdoctoral adviser, <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Prof. Karsten
Borgwardt</a> ensures that
sufficient funds for open access publications are available.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sometimes the cost is fielded by a conference; this
happens when the conference has a contract that ensures that its
publications will be available as special issue of some journal.
This might seem nice because it <em>shifts</em> the costs away from authors,
but it is also somewhat non-transparent; conference costs being high
already, I find it strange that some of the money goes into the
pockets of another party.</p>
<p>After all this negativity, it is time for a <em>positive example</em>:
NeurIPS, one of the flagship machine learning conferences, is
partnered with a publisher and makes <em>all</em> papers available for free
online. I <em>gladly</em> pay the conference fee for this!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How can this process be improved? I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: publishers should make it clear <em>where</em> the funds are
going. Are we increasing shareholder value by working for free? How
are profits split and used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giving back</strong>: it is generally understood that everyone needs to eat
and no one should have to work for free. Why is then that this
completely different in publishing? Almost all the profits are
essentially generated because editors and reviewers work for free.
I know that being remunerated for your reviewing work might raise
some questions about impartiality etc., so I think <em>paying</em> people to
write reviews might be somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>However, closely related to my point about transparency, publishers
could be more upfront about how they user their funds and <em>give back</em>
to the community. For example, publishers could sponsor students so
that they can visit a conference for free, or publishers could
sponsor the conferences themselves.</p>
<p>If you, as a publisher, engage the community and give back a little,
the community will be all the more happy to work with you. We need
you, but you also need us. Without the scientists, you cannot be
a scientific publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to excellence</strong>: publishers should commit to the highest
quality and the highest standards. Employ people that are capable of
working <em>with</em> the scientists, not <em>for</em> the scientists. Train your
employees to be experts in typography, typesetting, and pair them
with domain experts so that they do not create more work for the
authors by inadvertently destroying equations, figures, and so on.</p>
<p>This goal is not necessarily orthogonal to maximising your profits,
by the way: if you lower your standards, your reputation as
a publisher will suffer, meaning that scientists in the long
run&nbsp;(!) might not be willing to publish with you any more. If
you commit to excellence, by contrast, we will flock to you.</p>
<p>I know that working with a publisher that <em>cares</em> about the end
product as much as I do is a heavenly match! So we should endeavour
to make such …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Apropos of Apple’s ARM announcment, I thought I might write up a post on a recent bit of code I wrote that specifically looks at ARM64, and its benchmarks on various hardware.</p><p>I’ve been implementing some compact data structures for a project. One of the CPU hotspots for the implementation is the need to run a quick population count across a potentially large bit of memory.</p><p>If you’ve never seen population count before, it’s the count of the number of set 1 bits in a byte (or list of bytes) – for example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">0xF3 == 0b11110011
popCount(0xF3) == 6
</code></pre></div><p>Now, every reasonable x86_64/amd64<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> CPU in the past decade or so has a built-in instruction for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT"><code>POPCNT</code></a>. It works like this (in Go Assembler):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">MOV    $0xF3, R10  // Store a constant
POPCNT   R10, AX   // AX now equals 6
</code></pre></div><p>Go uses the built-in instruction for this in the <code>math/bits</code> via SSA compiler rewrites (which it added in 1.9), but only up to a uint64 at a time; using assembly to loop over a <code>[]byte</code> is considerably more efficient</p><p><a href="https://github.com/tmthrgd"><code>@tmthrgd</code></a> created a really nice little x86_64-assembly-optimized package at <a href="https://github.com/tmthrgd/go-popcount">github.com/tmthrgd/go-popcount</a>. It works great, works around a weird little Intel bug (see the helpful comments) and is still faster than looping and using the Go standard library, which it helpfully benchmarks as well.</p><p>Recently, I picked up one of the new 8GB Raspberry Pi 4s. Loaded it up with the nice new <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro 20.06</a> and set up my usual environment. As a test, I wanted to try my latest WIP data structure code.
Of course, the bottleneck was right where I expected it to be: in the population count.</p><h3 id="implementing-it">Implementing it</h3><p>I discovered that ARM64 has a <code>POPCNT</code>-like instruction, logically enough called <code>CNT</code>. I thought, since I’ve been playing with Go assembly for memmove, why not try my hand at the new architecture?</p><p>Go already has the SSA-rewrite for OnesCount on ARM (added in 1.11), but again, only a uint64 at a time. There might be some performance on the table.</p><p><a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0596/a/DDI_0596_ARM_a64_instruction_set_architecture.pdf">Official architecture guide</a> at the ready, I got to work. And there was a lot to learn. Some notes:</p><h4 id="1-its-part-of-the-vector-suite-neon">1. It’s part of the vector suite, NEON</h4><p>NEON is the name for the addition of vector instructions to the ARM architecture, so I’d be working with both an unfamiliar architecture <em>and</em> its vector instructions.</p><p>In x86-land, <code>POPCNT</code> and vectorization are two separate concepts. <code>POPCNT</code>, as an instruction, deals with everyday, 64-bit integer registers, and not the vector registers (even though it appeared approximately the same time as the addition to vector instructions, SSE4)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p><p>ARM/NEON did <code>CNT</code> differently. Since you can load an array of items (say, 16 bytes, in the ARM64 vector registers), <code>CNT</code> will count them individually. In fact, you can <em>only</em> do it in vectors of single bytes.</p><p>So this means that the following signatures are approximately the way to think about it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>popCountx86</span><span>(</span><span>in</span> <span>uint64</span><span>)</span> <span>uint64</span> <span>// register-at-a-time, 64-bit (8 bytes)
</span><span></span>
<span>func</span> <span>popCountNeon</span><span>(</span><span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>16</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>16</span><span>]</span><span>uint8</span> <span>// 16 bytes all counted in parallel.
</span></code></pre></div><p>This ends up being really effective, as it turns out (below).</p><h4 id="2-gos-assembler-documentation-is-barebones">2. Go’s assembler documentation is barebones</h4><p>Writing instructions so that Go’s assembler is happy with the instructions you’re giving it is a bit frustrating.</p><p>There’s a good gloss at <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/">golang.org/pkg/cmd/internal/obj/arm64</a> which gives an overview of many of the differences.
For example, all vector instructions start with <code>V</code>, different than what ARM64 switched to (they used to commonly start with V on 32-bit ARM) – so while I understand the desire for continuity (and even subtly like it, knowing it’s a vector op) it’s just makes another little difference to remember vs. the original documentation.</p><p>But more frustrating is, even if your instruction is supported (and most of them are) knowing how to <em>use</em> the instruction in Go assembler boils down to “assume data goes left-to-right and hope there’s an example <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/asm/internal/asm/testdata/arm64enc.s">in the test suite</a>”</p><p>I’m a big Go fan, yet Go’s history into Plan 9 and accompanying assembler (and, relatedly, odd calling conventions) is one of my gripes about Go, even more than lack of generics (which is a topic for another day).
Sure, there were some good ideas in Plan 9 that influenced the design of Go – from a design level, it’s great! – but on the implementation level, this is one place where I kinda wish it had followed precident.
Take whichever side you want in the Intel vs GNU syntax debate, <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">creating a third option</a> means relearning all the quirks from scratch, and ignoring any documentation that already exists.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><p>The end result is my friendly fork of <code>go-popcount</code>: <a href="https://github.com/barakmich/go-popcount">github.com/barakmich/go-popcount</a></p><p>Really, it’s more of an extension than a fork – it provides the same API, just with handwritten assembly for ARM64 chips.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4><p>The vectorization works really well. The process is:</p><ul><li>Load a set of vector registers, 16 bytes each</li><li>popCount them</li><li>Vector sum their partial results (up to 32 individual vectors, to fit the 8-bit counts), trying to avoid a data dependency</li><li>Finally, sum (“widening”, in vector terms) the final vector</li><li>Add it to the final output</li></ul><p>The other thing to balance was how much to load from memory vs. how much work to do to optimize throughput. That ended up being about 8 vectors (128 bytes) at a time.
That may vary as a function of CPU, but it’s a good place to start.</p><h4 id="arm64-feels-nice">ARM64 feels nice</h4><p>This is purely subjective, but there were a number of moments where I felt “hey, that’s handy” in writing ARM64 assembly.
Of course modern x86_64 chips account for all of these differences and makes them performant – through deeper instruction pipelines or having <a href="http://sunnyeves.blogspot.com/2009/07/intel-x86-processors-cisc-or-risc-or.html">micro-op instruction queues</a> that ultimately pull the same tricks.
But at the same time, when you’re dropping down to work at the instruction level, it’s kind of a breath of fresh air.</p><h5 id="pre-and-post-increment">Pre-and-post increment</h5><p>A lot of the time when you’re working with an array of whatever you’re pulling a chunk of memory into registers, doing some transform, and putting it back.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm"><span>VLD1.P</span> <span>64</span><span>(</span><span>R1</span><span>),</span> <span>[</span><span>V16.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V17.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V18.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V19.B16</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Reads as load 1-byte*size structures into the following vector registers – so far so good, this is similar to the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/movdqu:vmovdqu8:vmovdqu16:vmovdqu32:vmovdqu64"><code>VMOVDQU</code></a> instruction family (though the size-structure variants on that instruction are a recent addition) on x86. It has a similar ability to load many registers in multiple back-to-back instructions through address/offset/size calculation, but ARM has a nice one-liner that way.</p><p>But I really like the auto-increment of <code>R1</code> by the read size (64) after loading – hence post-increment. Many loads from memory have a similar flag. It’s very descriptive and means things like “increment the offset register and decrement the size register and test” things live with their appropriate parts of the code, instead of having to increment later (and finding the optimal time)</p><h5 id="consistency-of-style">Consistency of style</h5><p>This is a holdover from history, but the consistency of having fixed-size instructions is a nice thing when trying to hand-assemble an instruction. I had to do some hand-assembly when <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39445">I discovered and reported a bug in Go</a>. It was silently writing the wrong version of the instruction while accepting the correct one as input. Kudos to the Go community – it was fixed by an expert within a day or two, so I’m looking forward to the next version that contains the fix!</p><p>Still, this meant with a <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">steady hand</a> and a copy of <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0596/a/DDI_0596_ARM_a64_instruction_set_architecture.pdf">the architecture guide</a> I could feasibly implement any instructions that were missing.</p><p>Also in consistency-land, most binary operations take <code>input1_reg, input2_reg, output_reg</code> with few exceptions. Omitting the output_reg is Go’s assembler syntactic sugar to set output to input2. x86, again for historical reasons (trying to keep instructions small), often has the store-to-the-second-register as the primary or only version of an operation, which can lead to more operations overall (and cognitive overhead IMO).</p><h3 id="benchmarking-on-arm">Benchmarking on ARM</h3><p>So let’s take a look at some benchmarks.
The most interesting thing about looking at population count is that this little routine does something useful and shows tradeoffs between CPU bounds and memory bandwith between the CPU, the on-chip caches, and main memory.
At array sizes small enough to fit into CPU cache (but big enough to run the compute loop a few times), the CPU is the limiting factor – how many bits it can count.
For larger data sizes, the memory bandwidth becomes the bound; the CPU is waiting on getting enough data to crunch through.</p><p>To this end, the benchmark curves in the repository max out in throughput at about 16K (most work possible, while still being in cache) and then trail down into a steady state as memory becomes the bound. So I’ll truncate the full benchmarks to compare peak throughput and long tail.</p><p>Some findings and commentary:</p><h4 id="raspberry-pi-4">Raspberry Pi 4</h4><div><pre><code data-lang="text">Unoptimized (Go implementation):
BenchmarkCountBytesGo/16K              297778          8056 ns/op     2033.78 MB/s
BenchmarkCountBytesGo/512M                  8     279380432 ns/op     1921.65 MB/s

Optimized (My hand-rolled assember):

BenchmarkCountBytes/512M                    8     131214574 ns/op     4091.55 MB/s
</code></pre></div><p>This was my finished product on my local Pi. I may be able to do better, but varying the block sizes between grabbing from memory and doing the vector addition for popcount topped out about here, so I’m fairly satisfied.</p><p>Interestingly, the ~4.1GB/s memory bandwidth follows exactly with <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/10/raspberry-pi-4-benchmarks-processor-and-network-performance-makes-it-a-real-desktop-contender/">initial read benchmarks of the Pi 4</a> suggesting it’s close to saturation, which is good news.</p><h4 id="ampere-emag">Ampere eMag</h4><p>So my next thought was to spin up an ARM64 server with my old friends at <a href="https://packet.net/">Packet</a>.

      <div id="main">
        

    

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]
// signature requires the request to have a `Content-Type`
fn multipart_upload(cont_type: &amp;ContentType, data: Data) -&gt; Result&lt;Stream&lt;Cursor&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;, Custom&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    // this and the next check can be implemented as a request guard but it seems like just
    // more boilerplate than necessary
    if !cont_type.is_form_data() {
        return Err(Custom(
            Status::BadRequest,
            "Content-Type not multipart/form-data".into()
        ));
    }

    let (_, boundary) = cont_type.params().find(|&amp;(k, _)| k == "boundary").ok_or_else(
            || Custom(
                Status::BadRequest,
                "`Content-Type: multipart/form-data` boundary param not provided".into()
            )
        )?;

    match process_upload(boundary, data) {
        Ok(resp) =&gt; Ok(Stream::from(Cursor::new(resp))),
        Err(err) =&gt; Err(Custom(Status::InternalServerError, err.to_string()))
    }
}

fn process_upload(boundary: &amp;str, data: Data) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    let mut out = Vec::new();

    // saves all fields, any field longer than 10kB goes to a temporary directory
    // Entries could implement FromData though that would give zero control over
    // how the files are saved; Multipart would be a good impl candidate though
    match Multipart::with_body(data.open(), boundary).save().temp() {
        Full(entries) =&gt; process_entries(entries, &amp;mut out)?,
        Partial(partial, reason) =&gt; {
            writeln!(out, "Request partially processed: {:?}", reason)?;
            if let Some(field) = partial.partial {
                writeln!(out, "Stopped on field: {:?}", field.source.headers)?;
            }

            process_entries(partial.entries, &amp;mut out)?
        },
        Error(e) =&gt; return Err(e),
    }

    Ok(out)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.
