<hr>

<p>Just yesterday, I released my <a href="https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/dither">dithering library</a>, written in Go.
It’s the product of many hours of research, experimentation, and refactoring. I’m
excited that it’s finally out, and to see what people create with it. Personally I’d like to create a CLI dithering
tool at some point that uses it.</p>

<p>Creating this library required research into the different algorithms for dithering, and how to implement them.
Unfortunately, not all of that knowledge is easily found. It’s spread across blog posts, Wikipedia pages without
citations, old books, and code comments. Recently, Surma wrote an article called
<a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a>.
It is an invaluable resource that combines lots of knowledge about dithering into one place. The main thing missing
from the post, however, is going beyond “monochrome”. Surma shows us how to dither with a 1-bit palette of black and
white, but what about more shades of gray? What about colour images? With this blog post I’d like to explore those
techniques, taking them out of my code and into English, so you can easily apply them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>First off, please read Surma’s post.</strong> It explains what dithering is, how it works, and many different algorithms.
I don’t feel the need to explain these again, but merely add on what I’ve learned.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2>

<p>An HN commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">informed me</a> that you cannot accurately represent
linear RGB with just 8-bits (0-255), you need at least 12. Because of this, I have updated the blog post to use
16-bit color (0-65535), and will be updating the library shortly. Make sure you do this in your code too!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Dithering operations consist of at least two steps, applied to each pixel. Sometimes there are further steps, like
“modify these nearby pixels”, but these are the basic ones.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the pixel’s colour value.</li>
  <li>Find the colour in the palette that is “closest” to that modified value and use that on the output image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we know from Surma’s post that step 1 must be done with linear RGB values. Otherwise, different values will be
affected differently – for example adding 5 to each colour won’t affect all colours the same way.</p>

<p>But what about step 2? How do we find the closest colour in the palette? In 1-bit dithering we don’t have to worry
about this, because anything above 0.5 is white, and anything below is black. But when your palette colours can be
anyhere in a 3D space, it is something that needs to be figured out.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, we’re not looking for a way that matches human perception. In fact, we are using Euclidean
distance with linear RGB values, which doesn’t match human perception at all! Why is this?
Thomas Mansencal (<a href="https://github.com/KelSolaar">@KelSolaar</a>) explains it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can factor out the observer [the human] because what you are interested in here is basically energy
conservation. The idea being that for a given pool of radiant power emitters, if you remove a certain number of
them, by how much must the radiant power of the remaining ones be increased to be the same as that of the full
pool. It is really a ratio and doing those operations in a linear space is totally appropriate!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This helped it click for me. Dithering can be thought of as trying to reconstruct the “radiant power” of the original
pixel colours, while restricted to a certain set of “emitters”, aka the palette colours. It is only with linearized
RGB values that we can properly measure the radiant power.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-grayscale">Random Noise (grayscale)</h2>

<p>Random noise is a good one to start with, to show the differences between 1-bit dithering and larger palettes.</p>

<p>Surma does this by basically just adding a random number from -0.5 to 0.5, and then thresholding it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>grayscaleImage</span><span>.</span><span>mapSelf</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>brightness</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0.5</span> 
    <span>?</span> <span>1.0</span> 
    <span>:</span> <span>0.0</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my library, there are two separate random noise functions. One is for grayscale, and one is for RGB. The grayscale
one looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>-</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>min</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The math with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is just to put the random value in the desired range. If we clean that up it’s more
understandable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>gray</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>rand</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>rand()</code> just represents a function that does whatever range we want, -0.5 to 0.5 in this case.</p>

<p>So, obviously this is quite similar to what Surma does. The heavy lifing of the dithering in this case is done by the
other code, the part that finds the best palette colour.</p>

<p>The main thing that’s worth noting here is how the rounding works. <code>roundClamp</code> rounds the value to an integer, and then
clamps it to the range 0-65535. But how is the rounding done?</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26122642">HN commenter</a> shared <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/1UCRko23/">this link</a>
which discusses different rounding methods, and the problems with the way rounding is often done. The best solution is to
use a rounding function that does this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a number exactly halfway between two values, round to the even value (zero is considered even here).</p>

  <p>round( 1.7 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.7 ) –&gt; 3<br>
round( 1.5 ) –&gt; 2 round( 2.5 ) –&gt; 2<br>
round( 1.3 ) –&gt; 1 round( 2.3 ) –&gt; 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not really about dithering, but this is a pretty important point to get things right mathematically.
Make sure you do it! Otherwise your outputs will be biased.</p>

<h2 id="random-noise-rgb">Random Noise (RGB)</h2>

<p>Back to random noise, but for colour this time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxR</span><span>-</span><span>minR</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minR</span><span>))</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxG</span><span>-</span><span>minG</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minG</span><span>))</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Float32</span><span>()</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>maxB</span><span>-</span><span>minB</span><span>)</span><span>+</span><span>minB</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And simplified:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randR</span><span>())</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randG</span><span>())</span>
<span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>roundClamp</span><span>(</span><span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>65535.0</span><span>*</span><span>randB</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple, it just adds randomness in each channel. This can be done with grayscale images too, but it won’t
work very well, because grayscale colours only actually have one dimension. So it will just not add as much
randomness as you would expect.</p>

<p>Also note that usually you’ll want the random ranges to be the same for R, G, and B.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<h2 id="ordered-dithering">Ordered Dithering</h2>

<h3 id="modifying-threshold-matrices">Modifying threshold matrices</h3>

<p>Most of the resources online that talk about ordered dithering talk about a “threshold matrix”. “Thresholding” is
how these matrices are applied for 1-bit dithering. You divide the matrix by whatever number is specified, scale
it to the colour value range, and compare it to each pixel in the image. If it’s less than the matrix value, make
it black, otherwise white. Obviously this doesn’t work with any other kind of palette. So what’s the solution?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Wikipedia</a> offers an answer. Unfortunately there’s no citation,
but I’ve confirmed independently that it works. Here it is with some of my own math added as well.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a percentage, usually a float from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. It’s the amount the matrix will be applied to the
image. The closer to zero it is, the smaller the range of input colors that will be dithered. Colors outside
that range will be quantized. Usually you’ll want a strength of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, to apply the matrix and dither fully, but
sometimes reducing it can be useful, to reduce noise in the output image. It is inversely proportional to contrast –
that is, when you reduce the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, it is visually similar to increasing the contrast.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can also be negative, from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-1.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This is useful in certain cases where the matrix usually
makes things bright, like what Surma describes with Bayer matrices.</p>

<p>Note that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>65535</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">65535</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is multiplied by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">strength</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because the colours in my code are in the range <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>65535</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[0, 65535]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If yours
are different you can change that number.</p>

<p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the value the entire matrix is divided by. It represents the maximum value of the matrix, and normalizes
it by dividing. Usually this is the product of the dimensions of the matrix. It can also be the
largest value in the matrix plus one.</p>

<p>The result of applying this operation to each cell of the matrix is a new, precalculated matrix, which can be added
to a pixel’s colour value for dithering. Adding 0.5 does not need to happen in this case. In my library, I call the
function that does this <code>convThresholdToAddition</code>, because that’s essentially the purpose of this – converting
a threshold matrix into one that can be used for addition.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is designed for matrices that range from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">max - 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re using a matrix you found that
starts at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, you’ll usually just want to subtract one from each value when you program it, then apply the operation
I described above.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-modified-matrix">Using a modified matrix</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve modified the matrix so it can be used for addition, it needs to be applied to the image. This is pretty
simple. Use modulus so the matrix values are tiled across the image, and add the same value in the R, G, and B channels.
If you’re using a grayscale image you can just apply it in the one channel, or still use RGB. Since the same value is
being added it doesn’t make much of a difference. Like always, make sure to clamp the values to the proper colour range.</p>

<p>Doing all of this definitely works with colour images, but it’s not the greatest. Here’s an example, where the palette
is red, green, and black.</p>

<p>As you can see, it doesn’t really emulate any of the yellow in the first example, while Floyd-Steinberg can. Once yellow is added
to the palette it looks pretty good though.</p>

<p>There are a lot of indispensable GUI tools that I use. These include Firefox, lyx, Gimp, KeepassX, Shutter, viking, dia, Wireshark, calibre, audacity, Handbrake and VLC. But where possible I still prefer to script things. My main development languages are still shell, Perl and C.</p>

<p>My shell is now bash. The vi keystrokes are burned into my fingertips and, as long as vim can be ported to new systems, that will be my text editor until I pass on. My mail client is now mutt (definitely not a web client) and my mail is stored locally, not on someone else's server.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is that, since a job change, I now have to deal with Windoze things. Thus, I have VirtualBox, libreoffice and Wine to help me do that.</p>

<p>I started with Unix on a Pyramid 90x. I now have a smart phone that blows the 90x out of the water on performance, RAM and storage. But I'm so very happy that, somewhere down underneath, there is still a Bourne shell and an operating system that does open(), close(), read(), write(), fork() and exec()!</p>

While technically correct, I believe these attributes tend to overlook other surprising properties.</p><p>In this article, I invite readers to learn more about its internal features, many of which became predominant in the market only after the Virtual Boy’s discontinuation.</p><hr><h2 id="display">Display</h2><p>The whole system is a curious piece of engineering. Externally, it resembles a bulky VR headset on a bipod. The player must place their head close to the eyepiece to see the game in action.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/virtualboy/case/front.f5ed2bf56afcaf7238bb81e26e42ea66a11e68a40b14581affc282e9ee25c268.png"><picture>

In reality, games look very crisp and in full size!</figcaption></div><p>Internally, it’s a whole different story (and a very complicated one too). For this reason, I thought it would be better to start by explaining how this console displays images and then go through the internal hardware.</p><h4 id="projecting-an-image">Projecting an image</h4><p>Once you switch the Virtual Boy on, you will start seeing two <strong>monochromatic red</strong> pictures (one for each eye) through the eyepiece. So far so good? Well, here is the interesting part: <strong>This console doesn’t have a screen</strong>, so what you see is more of an ‘illusion’ - Let’s dive deeper to know what’s going on.</p><p>The topics involved in explaining this (optics, visual phenomenons, etc) may feel difficult at first, but I constructed some interactive animations to make this section little more immersive.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-scanner-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-scanner">Scanner</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-mechanics-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-mechanics">Mechanics</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-display-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-display">Display</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-active-periods-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-active-periods">Active periods</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-scanner"><h4>Scanner</h4><p>The large volume of this console can be attributed to the <strong>Scanner</strong>, which fills up a big part of it. The Scanner is the area of the Virtual Boy that displays images. It’s composed of two <strong>Display units</strong>, each one independently projects a frame (giving a total of two frames, one per eye).</p><p>A Display unit is where all the ‘magic’ happens, it’s made of the following components:</p><ul><li>An <strong>LED Unit</strong>: Contains 224 red LEDs stacked vertically and the necessary circuitry to control each one of them.</li><li>A <strong>Lens</strong>: Refracts the light coming from the LEDs.<ul><li>At the top of the Virtual Boy’s case, there is a <strong>Focus slider</strong> used to shift the lenses closer or further away from the LEDs. This allows the user to adapt the console to their focal length (preventing blurry images).</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Mirror</strong>: Reflects the light coming from the lens and directs them to the user’s eyes. Furthermore, this component will be constantly oscillating thanks to a <strong>Voice coil motor</strong> connected to it. The motor is managed by the <strong>Servo control</strong>, a separate board which sends electrical pulses at 50 Hz.<ul><li>All in all, this is a very complex and fragile area of the console, so there’s a photo interrupter (a type of photosensor) installed. This reports the oscillation observed from the mirror to the Servo control, which in turns monitors the oscillations and applies the necessary corrections.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Next to the focus slider there is a <strong>IPD dial</strong> (knob-shaped switch), which adjust the distance between the two Display units. This is done to adapt the displays to the user’s inter-pupil distance.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-mechanics"><h4>Mechanics</h4><div><figcaption>Basic representation of the angle of the oscillating mirror over time (at a very slow motion)<br>The left and right LEDs are operating (active) during the red and blue period, respectively<br>During the grey period, no LED is operating (idle)<br>For sake of simplicity, the angular velocity represented here is constant (but not in the real world)</figcaption></div><p>Now that we have each component identified, let’s take a look how the Virtual Boy manages to show images to our eyes.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed before, there <strong>isn’t any dot-matrix display to be found</strong>, so why are we seeing two-dimensional images from the eyepiece? Similarly to the functioning of a CRT monitor, Display units play with the way we perceive images:</p><ul><li>The fact the mirrors oscillate enables a single column of LEDs to displace horizontally between our field of view. The angle of the mirror is strategically directed to place the LEDs on 384 different ‘column positions’ distributed across our field of view.</li><li>Human vision is logarithmic and the mirror oscillates at <strong>50 Hz</strong> (each period takes 20 ms). This is so fast we end up perceiving 384 columns of LEDs illuminating at the same time (afterimage effect) until the mirror stops oscillating.</li><li>All of this is perfectly synchronised with the LED controller, which updates each LED bulb every time the mirror is slightly moved. Thus, we end up seeing a full picture coming from the eyepiece.</li></ul><p>In practice, there are some conditions for all these principles to work:</p><ul><li>The LEDs must only operate when the angular velocity of the mirror is stable (in other words, not when the mirror is changing direction). This can be thought of as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#tab-2-4-result"><strong>Active State</strong></a> of a CRT monitor.</li><li>In relation to the previous point, the angular velocity of the mirror can’t stay constant (since the mirror can’t change direction instantly, the periods considered ‘stable’ will be subject to forces that will disrupt its velocity). To remedy this, the Virtual Boy stores a list of values in memory called <strong>Column Table</strong> which instructs how much time to dedicate for each column interval, in an effort to balance out excessive &amp; insufficient periods of ‘LED column’ exposure.</li><li>Let’s not forget that this whole process has to be done twice since we got two display units (one per eye). Unfortunately, both units can’t pull energy and data at the same time, so each one operates at different display periods (out-of-phase, 10ms apart). We don’t notice this (another illusion!).</li></ul></div><div id="tab-2-3-display"><h4>Display</h4><div><figcaption>Simplified representation of how the first LED unit operates during specific periods of time. Notice how the LEDs will start displaying each column of the frame-buffer during active periods.</figcaption></div><p>Contrary to previous video chips modelled after CRT displays (i.e. <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#graphics">PPU</a> and <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/master-system/#graphics">VGP</a>), graphics on the Virtual Boy are <strong>not rendered on-the-fly</strong>. The graphics chip on this console sends the processed frame to a frame-buffer in memory, each column of the frame is then sent to the LED array for display.</p><p>Once the Servo board detects it’s time for display, the graphics chip will start sending columns of pixels from the frame-buffer to those 224 vertically-stacked LEDs, one-by-one in a strategically synchronised matter so the LEDs will have shown 384 columns during the display period. Hence, the ‘screen resolution’ of this console is 384x224 pixels.</p><p>Moreover, we need to store two frame-buffers since each one will go to a different display unit. The graphics subsystem also employs double-buffering and other quirks (mentioned later in the ‘Graphics’ section). So, for now, just remember how a digital frame is sent to the LEDs.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-active-periods"><h4>Active periods</h4><div><figcaption>Another simplified animation, this time showing how the oscillation of the mirror deviates the LEDs light in a way the user will end up seeing a proper frame</figcaption></div><p>Consequently of this design, there are going to be periods of:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Display</strong> during which the LEDs are pulling an image from the frame-buffer and nothing can disrupt it.</li><li><strong>Active Display 2</strong>: Same as before but now the other Display unit is operating.</li><li><strong>Drawing idle</strong>: A period where none of the LEDs are operating and the angular velocity of the mirror is unstable.</li></ul><p>This cycle is repeated 50 times per second (hence the 50 Hz refresh rate). That means that for every frame, the CPU and GPU would have around 10ms worth of time to update the picture that the user will see. In reality, Nintendo’s engineers implemented something more sophisticated. Again, I’ll try to explain this with more depth in the ‘Graphics’ section. But for now I hoped you got a good understanding of how the Virtual Boy cleverly managed to produce a picture with inexpensive hardware.</p></div></div></div><p>This has been a quick explanation of how optics can turn a single vertical line into a picture. If you own or have read about the Virtual Boy before, you may be wondering when the three-dimensional imagery takes place. I just want to make it clear that none of the previous explanation have a connection with that effect. I’m mentioning this because in the past I’ve seen many places arguing that the oscillating mirrors are the cause of the ‘depth perception’, however, with all the information I’ve gathered in this study, I don’t think that claim is accurate.</p><p>That being said, I think it’s time we discuss the 3D phenomenon…</p><h4 id="creating-a-third-dimensional-vision">Creating a third-dimensional vision</h4><p>During the marketing of the Virtual Boy, there was a lot of fanfare regarding the fact this console could project a ‘3D world’. I’m not referring to images with 3D polygons stamped (like the other 5th gen. consoles), but the actual perception of depth.</p><p>In a nutshell, the Virtual Boy relies on <strong>Stereoscopic images</strong> to carry out that illusion. So this system wasn’t only capable of toying with our vision to project a full image, but it also did it in a way we would think certain drawings are closer/far away from others!</p><div><div><figcaption>Snapshot of the game seen from the different display units<br>Mario's Tennis (1995)</figcaption></div><p>The technique is very simple: Each of the two frames displayed (one on each eye) will have some elements slightly shifted horizontally, so when we try to see them with our two eyes, our brain will think they are nearer than others. This depends on the direction the elements are shifted.</p><p>Objects shifted towards the centre of your eyes (moved right on the left frame and moved left on the right frame) will appear closer, objects shifted away from the center of your eyes will appear further away. Finally, objects with no shifting will appear between the two other. This approach is called <strong>Stereoscopic parallax</strong>.</p></div><p>One of the drawbacks of stereoscopy is <strong>eyestrain</strong>. This was alleviated by the fact games provided an ‘automatic pause’ system which reminded the user to take breaks every 30 min. Nintendo also wrote down various warning messages in their packaging and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div>
						<p>When the US joined World War Two, it set back a number of peacetime R&amp;D projects. A team at Bell Labs had been studying some interesting properties of semiconducting substances, with the hope that they might find a way to replace the then-ubiquitous vacuum tube. But the exigencies of wartime complicated their plans—for one thing, the only supplier of sufficiently pure silicon was a German company—so they took a break to focus on wartime applications like radar. By the time they returned to regular work, the war was won, the US industrial base had dramatically ramped up (now DuPont, not German suppliers, made the world’s purest silicon), and the team had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of how substances like silicon and germanium behave.</p>
<p>Two years later, the transistor was born.</p>
<p>Crises radically reshape priorities; they cancel some projects, and accelerate others. But another effect they have is to make people more conscious of the future. To struggle through a crisis is, implicitly, to view the future as a point very much worth getting to. The Bell Labs team certainly helped build a better postwar future, and arguably Covid-19 has pushed people in the same direction.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t expect the results of this to be visible just yet. Scientific progress is visible on a lag: while the <i>New York Times</i> did mention the invention of transistors, it was midway through a column called “news of the radio,” hardly an accurate assessment of the impact of one of the twentieth century’s great inventions. Fortunately, there are more real-time ways to approximate people’s attitudes towards the future—the stock market is a real-time dollar-weighted poll about what kinds of companies will matter, and how that’s changing.</p>
<p>One of the surprising consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic was that, after a brief and fearsome decline, overall asset prices rose. That’s partly an artifact of how policymakers responded to the pandemic; pumping liquidity into the market does help offset supply shocks, and some of that money finds its way into speculative vehicles. But even <i>within</i> the market, there’s been a striking rise in investor interest in electric vehicles, autonomous cars, AI, and software companies ranging from consumer-facing companies like Facebook and Google to complex enterprise products like Snowflake.</p>
<p>The market’s judgments always have to be taken judiciously. Humans are imperfect judges of the present, not to mention the future. And as the recent GameStop fireworks demonstrate, sometimes prices can be driven more by technical aspects of market structure than by a cold and calculating assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Even GameStop’s run-up, though, was born out of forward-looking analysis of a business, not gambling. The original thesis behind buying GameStop, before it turned into a social movement devoted to punishing hedge funds, <i>was</i> an argument that the company was fundamentally underpriced—because the market had missed its opportunity to transcend brick-and-mortar retailing and digitize its business!</p>
<p>There are definite precedents for extrapolating about new concerns from stock prices. Defense stocks rise when war is rumored to be imminent, for example, and cyclical stocks’ performance tends to change ahead of macro data on the economic cycle. More narrowly, the economist Armen Alchian <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119914000546">deduced that hydrogen bombs use lithium by tracking the stock prices of mining companies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the world’s most valuable automaker is Tesla, with a market capitalization of $827bn, compared to $232bn for runner-up Toyota. Tesla isn’t valued based on its current production (just under 500,000 vehicles annually, compared to Toyota’s 9.2 million) or high margins (it eked out a net profit margin of just under 2%, less than half of Toyota’s results). Instead, Tesla is valued based on three forward-looking intangibles: it’s a pure-play electric vehicle company, its brand name is synonymous with clean energy rather than the more mixed reaction General Motors or Hyundai might engender, and its charismatic CEO has been able to recruit cult-like adherents to his vision of sustainable transportation and a multiplanetary species.</p>
<p>Calling Tesla is a cult isn’t pejorative, just descriptive: any organization that successfully accomplishes something that is widely believed to be impossible has to have distinctive beliefs, and any group of people who behave in unusual ways because of shared beliefs can be reasonably described as a cult. Some companies use their cultish aspects in harmful ways, but cults are a social design pattern that shows up over and over again, in successful companies and political movements. Cult-like traits are more common with companies that are growing fast—it would be hard for a steel mill or a local bank to engender this kind of behavior in its employees. It’s a way to focus everyone’s energy on the future, and avoid distracting questions about whether or not that future is viable—a way to raise the variance of outcomes, which makes extreme upside scenarios possible while increasing the odds of failure.</p>
<p>Tesla is not the only futuristic vehicle stock to be accorded a high value by the stock market. In fact, it’s arguably among the more mature. There are at least earnings to put a price/earnings multiple on, whereas many of the more recent EV companies are at an earlier stage than that. Luminar Technologies, for example, went public through a reverse merger late last year, and currently has a market value of almost $11bn. The company has minimal sales ($11m over the last nine months) and is still pouring money into R&amp;D. But LiDAR appears to be the most promising way to get cars to full autonomy, so investors are willing to value it based on the chance that a) autonomous vehicles will happen, b) they’ll use LiDAR, c) they’ll use Luminar’s systems to do it, and d) Luminar will be able to earn acceptable margins selling it.</p>
<p>The joint probability of all of those possibilities is low if they’re independent: if there’s a 10% chance of autonomous vehicles, a 10% chance they’ll use LiDAR, a 10% chance that LiDAR-using AVs will use Luminar’s technology, and a 10% chance that Luminar will get good margins, then the odds of Luminar being a good investment work out to 0.01%. But the more ambitious a company is, the more its job is to make those variables <i>conditional</i> instead: the closer a company gets to being the <i>only</i> way a given technology can happen, the more technology risk becomes synonymous with business risk, which compresses the overall range of outcomes. It also solves for the viable-business condition: if there’s just one company that can make AVs possible, then that company will have the pricing power necessary to make them profitable, too.</p>
<p>This dynamic actually works in two directions: first, it means that the odds of Luminar selling LiDAR conditional on LiDAR becoming ubiquitous are higher, because the latter is most probably going to happen if the former is true. And second, it’s a recruiting tool: if there’s one company that has a reasonable shot at accomplishing something, and it’s a desirable goal, then the company has a monopoly on the kinds of employees who can achieve that goal. This is a point Peter Thiel articulates in <i>Zero to One</i>, and it’s one of the reasons technology companies have such a skewed distribution of outcomes. They articulate a variant view, which means they attract people who share that variant view—and since the argument is settled by technology and economics, they don’t have to persuade the rest of the world, just to offer a better product.</p>
<p>The rise of special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, is a general testament to a more forward-looking market. In a conventional IPO, an operating company sells shares to the public; with a SPAC, an empty shell company goes public, and then identifies a private company to merge with. Due to a quirk in securities laws, a traditional IPO prospectus only shows a company’s backwards-looking estimates, and makes heavily-qualified statements about the future. A company that goes public through a SPAC is technically engaging in a merger, rather than an IPO, and the rules are different. When a public company buys another company, securities laws allow it to talk about that company’s anticipated growth, or the likely cost savings of the merger. Similarly, SPAC offerings can talk up a company’s long-term prospects, and even make exact estimates of future revenue.</p>
<p>SPACs have existed for years, but they exploded in popularity in 2020. Of the 466 SPAC companies that went public from 2011 through 2020, 248 of them went public in 2020 alone. A number of technical forces drove this—a large number of private companies looking for acquisitions, investors eager to get into <i>any</i> growth company early, some technicalities around SPAC issuance that make them attractive to specialist hedge funds. But the key driver of excitement about SPACs is that they can take companies public based on a future-focused outlook.</p>
<p>When Virgin Galactic went public by merging with Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, the company, which has taken deposits but generated minimal revenue, was able to project $590 million in annual revenue in the year 2023, and over a quarter of a billion dollars in pretax, pre-depreciation earnings. While this was optimistic, it’s also demonstrative: a company like Virgin Galactic would have been almost impossible to take public in a conventional way, because backwards-looking financial statements showed only losses. it may not work out as a business, or live up to its projections, but those projections got more plausible once it had access to public markets for funding.</p>
<p>High valuations for money-losing, often pre-revenue companies remind people of the dot-com bubble, and it’s worth putting that bubble in perspective. Someone who bought the market at its peak in March 2000 has earned a 6% compounded return since then. …</p></div></div></div>

      <div><p><i>I sent this email to the whole team at YC yesterday:</i></p><p>When I joined&nbsp;YC&nbsp;7.5 years ago, there weren’t many people around. PG and Jessica were still running things. We had offices in Mountain View, Palo Alto, and on Kearny street, but they were nearly always empty. The only meeting on any calendar was the lunch on Thursdays where we’d talk about companies over takeout or at a table in a crowded restaurant.</p><p>The ways in which we’ve changed since then have been amazing to see.&nbsp;YC&nbsp;has grown in every way imaginable. The scope of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;funds is larger. The team is bigger and more capable. The number of companies is pushing towards some ever receding upper bound. There’s more software, a larger community, and more programming designed to help&nbsp;YC&nbsp;founders build better futures.</p><p>I feel a deep sense of pride and honor at the part that I’ve played in that change and growth. I recall the first conversation I had with Aaron King about the Series A for Snapdocs. The questions he and I worked through were the kernel of the Series A program. I am amazed to see the directions in which Janelle is now building YCA. I’m grateful for the part I played in our conversations about growing beyond seed investing - conversations which eventually took shape as YCC. And, of course, there are fifteen batches worth of applications, interviews, dinners, office hours, and demo days rattling around in my head.<br></p><p>I’ve been thinking, recently, about the founders with whom I’ve had a chance to work. I’ve lost count of the number of incredible people I’ve gotten to know over these last years. Thinking back, it’s easy to see how the sheer weight of numbers can drive a person to be jaded about the problems that founders face. But the other night, as I spoke with a founder about a tough situation, I was reminded about how important it is to that individual that she gets the best possible advice. This is a lesson I learned time and again, and is something I hope I’ll never forget.</p><p>And then there’s the funny stuff. There were stolen air conditioners, barefoot pitches, robots that did not make sandwiches, update emails pulled from the I Ching, bandages, inhaled jet fuel, and literal blood on the interview floors. These are the things that I’ll remember long after everything else.</p><p>The truth is, I only meant to stick around&nbsp;YC&nbsp;for two years. Somehow, that two became two more, and then some more. As meaningfully as I’ve enjoyed my work here, it’s time for me to move onto something different and new and outside the bounds of what&nbsp;YC&nbsp;does. That’s a strange, exhilarating moment, and an important one for me and for my family. The pandemic provided the practical and existential nudge I needed to see the depth of this need.</p><p>To my fellow partners - thank you for your tireless work for our founders and for&nbsp;YC. Thank you for everything you’ve taught me, for all the strange conversations we’ve had, and for all the demo day presentations we’ve crafted.</p><p>To PG and Jessica and Trevor and RTM - thank you for giving me this opportunity and for making&nbsp;YC&nbsp;the kind of place I could love enough to stay long after I meant to leave.</p><p>To Janelle - thank you for building YCA with me and for being the best person I could imagine to take it into the future.</p><p>To everyone else -&nbsp;YC’s mission in the world is abstract. It could mean so many things, but it wouldn’t be anything without your work. Whether you are managing founder expectations about housing in the Bay Area, helping someone understand the mysteries of cap tables, talking someone down off the ledge of yelling at a reporter, or making sure that there will one day be an office to come back to, you are what makes&nbsp;YC&nbsp;a viable, vital force in the world.</p><p>I’ve never liked&nbsp;goodbye.</p><p>aaron</p></div>

        <h4>February 12th, 2021 · 5 minute read</h4>

        <p>
          I've seen quite a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21990566">few</a> <a href="https://blog.pushbullet.com/2020/05/13/lets-guess-what-google-requires-in-14-days-or-they-kill-our-extension/">people</a> <a href="https://blog.lipsurf.com/part-ii-after-3-years-of-work-chrome-killed-my-extension-and-wont-tell-me-why/">complaining</a> lately about the Kafkaesque Chrome extension review process, so when I started running into my own problems with the Chrome Web Store I wasn't exactly surprised.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn’t until I submitted the same extension to the Firefox Add-Ons Store that I saw just how good things could be. In a world of walled gardens watched over by heavy handed reviewers, Firefox's review process was laughably good.
        </p>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            In January 2020 my buddy and I started working on an idea we had for an automation app. We called it Otto.
          </p>

          <p>
            Otto consisted of two parts: a Mac app and a browser extension. After a few months worth of nights and weekends we had an alpha version we were ready to share with friends. I submitted the browser extension to Chrome under my own personal account, and after a review process of a couple days it was accepted. So far so good.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            The trouble started a few months later. After some more development and discussion, we re-framed our idea as an app to make custom keyboard shortcuts and we decided to rename Otto to <a href="https://keysmith.app/">Keysmith</a>. We also took the time at this point to create a company Google account. We renamed the extension and submitted it from our new company account.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be clear: changing the name was the <i>only</i> change we made.
          </p>

          <p>
            A few days later we received a rejection email. Here's a timeline of our interaction:
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit Keysmith to the Chrome Web Store.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                First rejection email.

                Quick summary:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Keysmith "violates the 'Use of Permissions' section"</li>
                <li>We should "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary"</li>
                <li>"If more than one permission could be used to implement a feature, you must request those with the least access to data or functionality."</li>
                <li>We shouldn't attempt to "future proof"</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                We double check the permissions we've requested and can't find any problems. We respond asking for more detail.
                </p><p>
                We also mention that we had previously submitted the <i>same</i> extension with the <i>same</i> requested permissions, just under a different name (Otto). We hoped they'd say "oh, in that case we'll approve this right away!". But instead:
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                Otto, our <i>existing extension</i>, is removed from the store and no additional detail on the rejection is provided. In fact, this email contains the <i>same exact</i> text as the previous one.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond, again asking for more detail. We ask if it would help if we expanded on how we're using each permission in the permissions justification section.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the <i>exact same text again</i>. No further detail. No help at all.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We suspect these reviews are entirely automated, so we ask if we can speak to a "human reviewer", hoping this will trigger a manual review (we also consider dropping an f-bomb for the same reason, but decide to remain decent for now).
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with some <i>slightly</i> different text, but still nothing useful.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We try adding a lot more detail to the "justification" section for each of the permissions we use and we resubmit.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the exact same text as the first rejection.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We respond with one more plea for more more information.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                They respond with the same text again.
              </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            At this point I dig into Chrome's documentation once again with a fine-tooth comb and I make a discovery: we had been requesting both the <span>tabs</span> and <span>activeTab</span> permissions, but since we also requested permission to run on <span>&lt;all_urls&gt;</span> it turns out that the features made available by <span>activeTab</span> were a strict subset of the features made available by <span>tabs</span>. So the <span>activeTab</span> permission was redundant. We weren't opening up any new functionality, we were just asking for a <i>redundant</i> permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This discovery made the Chrome review team's communications far more frustrating in retrospect. The line that all of their emails repeated was "Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary". And, sure, we had asked for <span>activeTab</span> when we didn't need it, but that permission <i>didn't grant us any more functionality</i>. They had rejected our extension 6 times with no detail <i>because of a technicality</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We committed the 1 line diff removing the <span>activeTab</span> permission and resubmitted. A day later it was accepted.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            A Firefox version of our browser extension had long been on our list, but for the first little while it didn't feel worth the additional support cost. We didn't know exactly how large that cost would be, but we suspected that there would be enough differences between the two browsers that it'd be a bit of a hassle to maintain them both.
          </p>

          <p>
            Boy were we wrong. When we finally started looking into porting our extension to Firefox we found that we had to make <i>zero</i> changes to the code. None whatsoever. Firefox even supported the use of the global <span>chrome</span> object for accessing extension APIs (if you're curious, Chrome is not kind enough to return the favor).
          </p>

          <p>
            So we created a Firefox developer account, submitted our extension, and girded ourselves for another rough ride.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Boy were we wrong.</i>
          </p>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We submit the first version of our extension to Firefox.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <div>
              <div><p>
                Less than 3 hours later we receive an email from Firefox that says, in effect, "Sorry this is taking so long, but we'll get to it soon!"
                </p><p>
                Responses from the Chrome team usually came in the wee hours of the morning, making the effective turnaround about 24 hours. Firefox apologizing after fewer than 3 hours was <i>hilarious</i> to us.
              </p></div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            
            <p>
                We get an email saying the extension was accepted exactly 24 hours after submission.
              </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Further updates have been even speedier, usually only taking 2 or 3 minutes to be scanned and accepted. One of our updates even got accepted before I finished uploading the unminified source archive (which they require if you minify in production). And the dashboard shows your position in the review queue to give you some idea of when it'll complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air, and we won't be neglecting support for Firefox ever again in the future.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          

          <p>
            I realize that in some ways this is an unfair comparison. Chrome's market share is much larger than Firefox's these days, so surely they also have to deal with far more extension submissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the lack of transparency in their process was infuriating and counter-productive. Had someone taken the time to manually review our case, or at least <i>read any of the emails</i> we sent, we could've resolved this issue with one response. Instead it took 6 responses and a week of wondering if this review process would kill our product before it even launched.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really hope things improve, but I'm not counting on it.
          </p>

    <p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS</a> when it was featured in hxp CTF and then on <a href="https://twitter.com/liveoverflow">LiveOverflow’s</a> YouTube channel. SerenityOS is an open source operating system written from scratch by <a href="https://twitter.com/awesomekling">Andreas Kling</a> and now has a strong and active community behind it. If you’d like to learn a bit more about it then the recent <a href="https://cppcast.com/serenity-os/">CppCast episode</a> is a good place to start, as well as all of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/andreaskling">fantastic videos by Andreas Kling</a>.</p>

<p>Two of the recent videos were about writing exploits for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMvjaoBLPxA">typed array bug in javascript</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt6-TC6FtMs">kernel bug in munmap</a>. The videos were great to watch and got me thinking that it would be fun to try and find a couple of bugs that could be chained together to create a full chain exploit such as exploiting a browser bug to exploit a kernel bug to get root access.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>I started looking around and discovered an integer overflow when creating a typed array from an array buffer, the length was multiplied by the element size which could overflow.

<p>This could be used to create two powerful primitives, one that could read an arbitrary address and the other that could read an arbitrary amount from some allocated memory. These were the same primitives that Kling created in his video which meant that the issue could be exploited in exactly the same way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding a vtable pointer with the offset primitive by spraying lots of Numbers</li>

<p>While I was looking into exploiting this, someone else spotted the same issue and it was quickly patched.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/f6c6047e49f1517778f5565681fb64750b14bf60"><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/slack.jpg" alt="slack"></a></p>

<p>As I had already started and wanted to keep using the same issue, I kept working from <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commit/c899ace3ad1efbf1bc8f8ee2ebb1e35903d7224b">this commit</a> which still had the bug :)</p>

<p>Exploiting the issue is pretty much identical to the video above and it does a great job explaining what is going on, so I wont go into too much detail. Here Is what I ended up with:</p>

<p>After loading this up and setting a breakpoint with gdb at <code>0x9d000000</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://devcraft.io/assets/serenity/gef.jpg" alt="gef"></p>

<p>Success! Arbitrary code in the browser.</p>

<h3 id="kernel-bug-hunting">Kernel Bug Hunting</h3>

<p>Next it was time to try and find a kernel bug that could be reached from the browser process. There had been a few issues with integer overflows, so I started looking for places that this might happen. After some searching I saw the following in <a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/22b0ff05d4a5b087d805d8147ca12efe410cb18f/Kernel/VM/RangeAllocator.cpp#L139">RangeAllocator::allocate_anywhere</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>available_range</span> <span>=</span> <span>m_available_ranges</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>

    <span>// FIXME: This check is probably excluding some valid candidates when using a large alignment.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>(</span><span>effective_size</span> <span>+</span> <span>alignment</span><span>))</span>
        <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each process has a list of available ranges that are used when allocating memory regions. This code is looping through all the ranges and seeing if there is one large enough to hold the requested size, taking into account the alignment (both <code>effective_size</code> and <code>alignment</code> are controlled by the user). The issue is that <code>effective_size + alignment</code> can overflow, resulting in a range being chosen that is too small to hold the requested size.</p>

<p>The <code>available_range</code> is then used to create a new allocated range:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>FlatPtr</span> <span>initial_base</span> <span>=</span> <span>available_range</span><span>.</span><span>base</span><span>().</span><span>offset</span><span>(</span><span>offset_from_effective_base</span><span>).</span><span>get</span><span>();</span>

                        SVG, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, short for <em>“scalable vector graphics”</em> is a format for, well, scalable vector graphics. In this article I summarize my opinion of the format, what its problems are and suggest what could be done to improve things.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SVG together with Inkscape regularly for a few years for sketches and graphics, and like to write it by hand to satisfy my love for precision and art through code. SVG and I have a kind of love-hate relationship. It’s powerful and has some nice free and open-source tooling, but the format itself is pretty ugly.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s <em>the</em> format for vector graphics. It is well supported by a range of programs from Adobe Illustrator to Inkscape for editing and in various browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a web standard so you can use it directly in websites. You can also use CSS with it.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s XML-based, so the syntax is familiar, it’s extensible and can benefit from the vast XML ecosystem. For example, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> you can reference other elements and definitions in an SVG file. Or <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> uses custom XML tags to extend SVG into their editor exchange format.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s powerful. You can do <em>a lot</em> with it. It obviously supports various path types and shapes, supports text and more, but also animations, gradients, effects and more.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>It’s a web standard. And as is customary for a web standard, SVG is magnificiently bloated. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/REC-SVG11-20110816.pdf">SVG specification</a> brings a whopping 826 (<em>eight-hundred twenty-six</em>) pages to the table. And as if that’s not enough, it’s also XML-based and cross-linked with other web standards, driving the scope of any implementation to dizzying heights.</p>
<p>If you want to be sure to correctly render all SVG files, not only do you have to consider 800 pages of SVG spec, but e.g.&nbsp;another 20 pages of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink spec</a>. Oh, and CSS as well, by the way. And, I shit you not, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>. Yes. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script">SVG files can include <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</a></p>
<p>SVG fits right in with web browsers. They’re hilariously bloated already, they already implement stuff like CSS and JavaScript that a complete SVG implementation requires. This problem of SVG is actually just the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html">problem of the web in general</a>. It’s scope is huge, it’s bloated and hard to work with.</p>
<p>SVG is nothing you could implement in a day. Or a week. Or a month. The huge amount of specifications, that are most often only partly implemented, makes it very hard to overview what supports what, confusing the user as to what features they can actually use if they want their SVG file to be universally supported.</p>
<p>Furthermore the XML-based syntax is pretty ugly and needlessly verbose. It’s tiring to write by hand and just as tiring to parse or generate automatically.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>A central problem that can be extracted from the points listed above is the one I detailed in my article about <a href="https://www.eisfunke.com/article/language-design-machine-or-human.html">language design for machines vs.&nbsp;humans</a>: SVG doesn’t know what it wants to be, a machine-focused language or a human-focused language and ends up doing badly in both aspects.</p>
<p>Is it a machine-processible language? It’s far too bloated for that. Writing parsers, renderers and generators for SVGs is a huge task. The syntax is repetitive and complex. It has a lot of features that could be represented by more basic features.</p>
<p>But is it a format well-suited for direct usage by humans? Well, no. Firstly, the exhausting syntax and complexity is also bad for human users. Secondly, it misses a lot of features that would make it suitable for direct use. A graphics language that is meant for direct human use would be <a href="http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz">Ti<em>k</em>Z</a> for LaTeX. While it’s not a great language regarding user experience in my opinion, it is definitely meant for humans and has the necessary features to help making creating complex graphics easy. But nobody would have the idea to use Ti<em>k</em>Z code as an interchange format for the finished graphic. Nobody would want to implement 1300 pages of Ti<em>k</em>Z manual just to view some graphic. Instead you compile it into an PDF (which is also a horrible format and badly bloated, but well). If SVG was a language meant for human use, compiling it into a machine-focused format would be the way to go as well, but as I said – it isn’t. It’s neither.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>A good idea would be to develop a simple vector graphics exchange format that is desigend to be easily processed by machines. As minimal in features as possible. Maybe JSON-based, definitely not XML-based. You should be able to implement a basic renderer in a few days, or even better, hours, without depending on two metric tons of XML ecosystem libraries. Bezier curves, elliptic curves, fills, outlines and gradients should mostly suffice to represent every unanimated SVG. An extension could allow animations in a separate file extension.</p>
<p>This minimal and well-delimited format could then have a strict test suite and be implemented in browsers and image viewers with relative ease. Users could rely on their graphic working everywhere and implementers wouldn’t have to worry about implementing XLink, CSS and JavaScript as well. It could save bandwidth and computation power. Compilers from and to SVG could be written for compatibility.</p>
<p>It could be used as export format of user-facing programs like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. For people wanting to markup graphics through code there’s already stuff like Ti<em>k</em>Z, <a href="https://diagrams.github.io/">Haskell diagrams</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html">Python matplotlib</a> that could also export to the new minimal interchange format.</p>
<p>I’m actually thinking about making a slim machine-focused vector graphics format (the name <em>“SlimSVG”</em> has been suggested :D) and writing my own human-focused Haskell graphics creation library with similar goals for my own purposes in the future, maybe as a student research project for the university.</p>
<p>In summary: Decide whether a language is for humans or for machines and do one of those things. And do the one thing well instead of both, but badly.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> This article was posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26114863">Hacker News</a> and landed on the front page, currently it’s on rank 3. I’m honored! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=26115086&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D26114863%2326115086">In the comments there</a> somebody mentioned an <a href="https://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg">interesting use of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in SVG</a>. I’m unsure though whether I should be impressed or horrified :D</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Somebody posted this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/livw57/svg_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly">Reddit</a> as well. Currently, there are over 150 comments, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> PEOPLE, PLEASE. This is absolutely not about “XML is bad, let’s do JSON instead”. I actually like XML more than JSON in total, I’m a fan of XML schema and nice strong schemas. And while I still don’t like the syntax, XML generally is a good fit for a document markup language like HTML. I mostly wouldn’t care whether a good format with a good data model was encoded in JSON, XML, YAML, binary, Brainfuck or monkey feces. The encoding really is the least important part. I just think that for a strictly machine-focused format for data JSON would be a better choice.</p>
<p>I guess though I should have anticipated that saying that I don’t like XML and then mentioning the word “JSON” would start a religious war.</p>

                    <p>On December 1st, 2020, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Amazon AWS announced Babelfish</a>. Babelfish “<em>adds an endpoint to PostgreSQL that understands the SQL Server wire protocol Tabular Data Stream (TDS), as well as commonly used T-SQL commands used by SQL Server. Support for T-SQL includes elements such as the SQL dialect, cursors, catalog views, data types, triggers, stored procedures, and functions</em>”. Wow. <strong>SQL Server wire and application compatibility for PostgreSQL!</strong></p>
<p>What this means is that Babelfish will be able to “impersonate” a SQL Server database. Applications may be able to run unchanged, believing that they are connecting to SQL Server, when they will actually be connecting to PostgreSQL-Babelfish.</p>
<p>Surely, compatibility will not be 100% at the beginning. But it will keep improving, and <strong>as long as it provides enough compatibility for a nice set of applications to run unchanged on Babelfish, it will open the door to migrations and replacing SQL Servers with Babelfish</strong>. This is very good news for the PostgreSQL Community!</p>
<h2 id="brief-analysis-on-postgresql-popularity">Brief analysis on PostgreSQL popularity</h2>
<p><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/85">PostgreSQL has been named (again) database of the year 2020</a>. This award is given based on “<em>DBMSs sorted by how much they managed to increase their popularity in 2020</em>”, which means that <strong>PostgreSQL was the database that grew the most in popularity in 2020</strong>. <strong>But in absolute terms, PostgreSQL’s popularity is still way behind that of Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server</strong>. Let’s analyze <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend">db-engines popularity trend chart</a> for the Top4 DBMS, on a linear scale (db-engines presents results on a logarithmic scale):</p>
<p><img src="https://postgresql.fund/img/dbengines_popularity_ranking-linear-900.png" alt="DB-engines popularity ranking - linear scale"></p>
<p>The trends for the last 8 years are clear: Oracle and SQL Server are constantly declining in popularity; MySQL is slightly declining; and PostgreSQL is clearly growing in popularity. But while PostgreSQL almost tripled in popularity in these eight years, it is still far behind the other three.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL became the database of 2020 because its popularity grew the most in the last year. The other three mentioned databases declined in popularity during 2020. If we assume the same rate of change in popularity will continue for the upcoming years, by 2025 PostgreSQL would still remain in the 4th place, albeit close to SQL Server. It won’t overtake SQL Server until 2026, and by 2030 PostgreSQL would still lag behind Oracle and MySQL.</p>

<p>How is this analysis related to Babelfish? <strong>Babelfish opens the door to new users, new markets, new opportunities. <strong>Babelfish may bump PostgreSQL’s popularity further, targeting use cases that either PostgreSQL is not able to reach today; or can only reach via complex technology migrations.</strong> Babelfish could be one of the many potential boosts that PostgreSQL needs in order to become a more universally used database</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="to-fork-or-not-to-fork-thats-the-question">To fork, or not to fork, that’s the question</h2>
<p>In their announcement, AWS said that “<em>We are open sourcing Babelfish in 2021. […] We are releasing Babelfish under the Apache 2.0 license. We invite others to become active in the project, and we will see it as a sign of success when developers outside of AWS become committers or maintainers. You can help by adding or extending Babelfish functionality, submitting feature requests, working on documentation, and contributing test cases</em>”. They also mentioned the code will be published on GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>At the time Babelfish will be published, it will likely require changes to PostgreSQL to enable Babelfish to be an extension</strong>. Some people may call that a “fork” of PostgreSQL, and others may call it a “development branch”. The difference between the two will only be clear over time. Note that PostgreSQL development model doesn’t use feature branches, and in my opinion it’s a great model –but this is an entirely different topic. It is really appreciated that AWS is releasing the code as open source, and under a permissive license (that should be compatible with PostgreSQL’s). <strong>If AWS developers work with the PostgreSQL Community to get the necessary changes merged into PostgreSQL core, then it would have been a development branch, and not a fork. This is something that the PostgreSQL Community and all parties involved need to figure out</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 25th, Amazon AWS made a first move. In an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAGBW59d5SjLyJLt-jwNv%2BoP6esbD8SCB%3D%3D%3D11WVe5%3DdOHLQ5wQ%40mail.gmail.com">email to PostgreSQL’s hackers mailing list</a>, Jan Wieck, a well-known Postgres-er, proposed to start discussing the implementation of protocol hooks. These hooks would enable to implement SQL Server’s protocol as an extension, rather than a fork.</p>
<p>Protocol hooks are, possibly, not the only hooks or modifications to PostgreSQL core that would be required to integrate the whole Babelfish project. With those changes to the core most of the Babelfish code could possibly be integrated in core as an extension(s). I cannot estimate the complexity of these core changes. But I believe that it would be a worthwhile effort, an effort that may further increase PostgreSQL outreach.</p>
<p>Only very recently (Feb 10th, 11th) some initial, very interesting, discussion around this proposal has started (including a very interesting offer to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CADUqk8UndFi7WHVNZscs4ZCk37_2aBUw-K32QA7sQd_3cJ%2Bqng%40mail.gmail.com">open source MySQL protocol compatibility for Postgres!</a>). It’s understandable, it’s a very busy time for PostgreSQL hackers (the last Commitfest for feature inclusion into PostgreSQL 14 is ongoing). But Babelfish was already announced more than two months ago; and it could be published anytime. I believe we need to start a deeper conversation about Postgres-Babelfish integration sooner than later. And what is being discussed so far are mainly technical considerations around the integration of one of the possibly several integration points that may be required. <strong>I’d love to also have a strategic discussion, where the Community would address, from a leadership perspective, what would be the plans for integrating, or not, Babelfish</strong>. <strong>Is Babelfish the Elephant in the Room?</strong> Probably not anymore, but I anyway hope this post will help, at the very least, to spark the strategic discussion.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? What will happen if PostgreSQL would not implement such hooks or will not pursue understanding with AWS, for the common benefit, and help Babelfish and PostgreSQL cooperate and allow for code bases integration?</p>
<p><strong>Under this scenario, AWS will probably have to keep Babelfish as a fork</strong>. For one, AWS already keeps Aurora as a fork, even though it’s an internal one. Given AWS’ well-known customer obsession and that AWS doesn’t kill services that they started offering, I think that if given no other chance they will keep Babelfish as a separate fork, getting its own share of features and contributors. Surely AWS knows that maintaining a fork is expensive. And I believe they have no intention to have it as a fork (otherwise, they won’t be publishing it as open source). So there will be serious intentions and efforts to merge it into PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all. But the recent Elastic case has demonstrated that AWS is committed to the open source software that is part of their managed services, and are willing to step up with a lot of resources when they are required to continue serving their customers. Apparently AWS has around 200 open job positions (!!) for developers working on Elasticsearch. Surely they can do the same for Babelfish, especially given that RDS Postgres/Aurora/Babelfish is probably a much larger business for them than Elastic.</p>
<h2 id="on-protocol-hooks">On protocol hooks</h2>
<p>Jan also argued that “<em>Creating the necessary infrastructure in the postmaster and backend will open up more possibilities, that are not tied to our compatibility efforts. Possible use cases for wire protocol extensibility include the development of a completely new, not backwards compatible PostgreSQL protocol or extending the existing wire protocol</em>”. I cannot agree more. This effort not only benefits the Babelfish integration; but also opens the door for new PostgreSQL protocols.</p>
<p>The current PostgreSQL protocol (v3) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/release-7-4.html">has been in use since PostgreSQL 7.4</a>, released in 2003. It works well, and has spun the broadest possible set of drivers, tools and even compatible databases that use it (like CockroachDB, Crate.io or NoisePage, for example). But it also has some limitations and well-known problems. There is an entry in PostgreSQL “TODO” about <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo#Wire_Protocol_Changes_.2F_v4_Protocol">proposed changes for an eventual v4 version of the protocol</a>. I also participated in another <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/95ba7b261e39754674c5817695ae5ebf9a341fae/backend_protocol_v4_wanted_features.md">“brain dump” on v4 proposed features</a>. But despite much talk, v4 has not happened and there’s no ongoing effort to make it happen. v3 is to stay for long.</p>
<p>Why is that, why can’t the protocol evolve? Have a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CD5C1525-8B2C-4986-87F0-B1CB3B52ACA7%40wa-research.ch">this thread</a>, where a proposal to implement an HTTP protocol for PostgreSQL was made. Other than the proposal about HTTP itself –which has its own merits, and is a topic that I believe should definitely be discussed again–, the general sentiment was that <strong>any new protocol would have to provide all the features that the current protocol has, work for every use case, do not disrupt existing drivers or provide good means for driver rewrites; and do it significantly better than the current one</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovators-dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</h2>
<p>I don’t have an MBA, but this to me is a clear case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a>. PostgreSQL protocol v3 is the incumbent, and protocol v4 and/or other protocols like HTTP are the potential disruptive innovators. In what looks like a perfect match for Christensen’s book, a disruptive protocol innovation “<em>would not initially satisfy the demands of even the high end of the market</em>”. In other words, initial versions of these protocols should not target feature parity with the incumbent. They should rather focus on doing the basics, but much better, with a compelling higher value proposition.</p>
<p>Eventually, these protocols “<em>will surpass sustaining technologies</em>” and may end up replacing the current v3 protocol. This was very well explained by Prof. Clayton and is represented on his famous graph comparing the product …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

    <p><em>Posted on January 30, 2021
    
        by Thomas Mahler
    </em></p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Quite a while back I wrote a larger article on the algebraic foundation of software patterns which also covered the <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">MapReduce algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>During the research digged out a paper on <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0498/3a1c0d6343e21129aaffca2a1b3eec419523.pdf">algebraic properties of distributed big data analytics</a>, which explained that a MapReduce will always work correctly when the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a Monoid under the <code>reduce</code>-operation.</p>
<p>For some reason, I was not convinced that this Monoid-condition was enough, because all the typical examples like word-frequency maps are even <strong>commutative</strong> Monoids under the respective reduce operation.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following personal theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if the intermediate data structure resulting from the <code>map</code>-phase is a <strong>commutative Monoid</strong> under the <code>reduce</code>-operation, then a parallel MapReduce will produce correct results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to validate this property using the <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2">QuickCheck test framework</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the QuickCheck tests failed! This finally convinced me that my theory was wrong, and after a little deeper thought, I could understand why.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.</p>
<p>The code shown in this blog <a href="https://github.com/thma/CommutativeMonoid">is also available on GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="commutative-monoids">Commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>In abstract algebra, a monoid is a <em>set</em> equipped with an <em>associative binary operation</em> and an <em>identity element</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest example for a <em>commutative Monoid</em> is <span>\((\mathbb{N}_0, +, 0)\)</span>: the natural numbers under addition with <span>\(0\)</span> as the identity (or neutral) element. We can use QuickCheck to verify that indeed the Monoid laws plus commutativity are maintained.</p>
<p>If we want to use <code>GHC.Natural</code> type to represent natural numbers, we first have to make <code>Natural</code> instantiate the <code>Arbitrary</code> type class which is used by QuickCheck to automatically generate test data:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.QuickCheck</span> (<span>Arbitrary</span>, arbitrary, <span>NonNegative</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>import</span>           <span>GHC.Natural</span>     (<span>Natural</span>, naturalFromInteger)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>instance</span> <span>Arbitrary</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5">  arbitrary <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    <span>NonNegative</span> nonNegative <span>&lt;-</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    <span>return</span> <span>$</span> naturalFromInteger nonNegative</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can start to write our property based tests. For algebraic structures it is straightforward to come up with properties: we just write the required laws (associativity, 0 is identity element and commutativity) as properties.</p>
<p>I am using Hspec as a wrapper around QuickCheck as it provides a very nice testing DSL which makes it easy to read the code and the output of the test suite:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>import</span>           <span>Test.Hspec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>spec ::</span> <span>Spec</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">spec <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>

<p>The output of these tests will be as follows:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>Monoid</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Natural Numbers under Addition'</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb3-4">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-5">    <span>has</span> 0 as identity (or neutral) <span>element</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb3-7">    <span>is</span> commutative</span>
<span id="cb3-8">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So behind the scenes, QuickCheck has generated test data for 100 tests for each property under test. For all these data the test cases passed.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a proof. But it gives us some confidence that our math text-books are correct when giving Natural Numbers under addition as an example for a commutative Monoid.</p>
<p>OK, that was easy! Now let’s move to non-commutative Monoids.</p>
<h2 id="non-commutative-monoids">Non-commutative Monoids</h2>
<p>Strings (or any other Lists) under concatenation are a typical example. It’s easy to see that <code>"hello" ++ ("dear" ++ "people")</code> equals <code>"(hello" ++ "dear") ++ "people"</code>, but that <code>"hello" ++ "world"</code> differs from <code>"world" ++ "hello"</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to formalize these intuitions as QuickCheck property based tests again.</p>
<p>First I’m introducing an alias for <code>(++)</code>, as it is defined on any list type, it would be required to have type signatures in all properties (as we had all those <code>:: Natural</code> signatures in the examples above). So I define an operation <code>(⊕)</code> which is only defined on <code>String</code> instances:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1">(⊕)<span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">(⊕) a b <span>=</span> a <span>++</span> b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can extend our test suite with the following test cases:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">  describe <span>"The Monoid 'Strings under concatenation'"</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">    </span>
<span id="cb5-3">    it <span>"is associative"</span> <span>$</span> </span>
<span id="cb5-4">      property <span>$</span> \x y z <span>-&gt;</span> ((x ⊕ y) ⊕ z) <span>`shouldBe`</span> (x ⊕ (y ⊕ z))</span>
<span id="cb5-5">      </span>
<span id="cb5-6">    it <span>"has \"\" as left and right identity element"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7">      property <span>$</span> \x <span>-&gt;</span> (x ⊕ <span>""</span> <span>`shouldBe`</span> x) <span>.&amp;&amp;.</span> (<span>""</span> ⊕ x <span>`shouldBe`</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output looks promising:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1">  <span>The</span> Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">    <span>is</span> associative</span>
<span id="cb6-3">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span>
<span id="cb6-4">    <span>has</span> <span>""</span> as left and right identity element</span>
<span id="cb6-5">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 100 tests.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now let’s try to test the non-commutativity:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">    it <span>"is NOT commutative"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2">      property <span>$</span> \x y <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>`shouldNotBe`</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But unfortunately the output tells us that this is not true:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">    <span>is</span> NOT commutative FAILED [1]</span>
<span id="cb8-2"></span>
<span id="cb8-3">  <span>1</span>) <span>Monoid</span>, The Monoid <span>'Strings under concatenation'</span>, is NOT commutative</span>
<span id="cb8-4">       <span>Falsifiable</span> (after 1 test)<span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6">         <span>""</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7">       <span>not</span> expected: <span>""</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We formulated the property in the wrong way. The <code>(⊕)</code> <em>may be commutative for some</em> edge cases, e.g.&nbsp;when one or both of the arguments are <code>""</code>. But it is not commutative <em>in general</em> – that is for all possible arguments.</p>
<p>We could rephrase this property as <em>“There exists at least one pair of arguments <span>\((x, y)\)</span> for which <span>\(\oplus\)</span> is not commutative”</em>:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>QuickCheck does not come with a mechanism for <em>existential quantification</em>. But as is has <code>forAll</code>, that is <em>universal quantification</em>. So we can try to make use of the following equivalence:</p>
<p><span>\[\exists (x,y) \left [  x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ] 
  \equiv 
  \neg \forall (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y = y \oplus x \right ]\]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately we can not write this simply as <code>not forAll</code>, as <code>forAll</code> returns a <code>Property</code> but <code>not</code> expects a <code>Bool</code>. But as explained in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42764847/is-there-a-there-exists-quantifier-in-quickcheck">this discussion on Stackoverflow</a> it is still posible to implement our own <code>exists</code>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>exists ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Arbitrary</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2">exists <span>=</span> forSome <span>$</span> resize <span>1000</span> arbitrary</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>forSome ::</span> (<span>Show</span> a, <span>Testable</span> prop) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Gen</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> prop) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Property</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">forSome gen prop <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6">  mapResult (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r {P.reason <span>=</span> <span>"No witness found."</span>, P.callbacks <span>=</span> []}) <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">    once <span>$</span> disjoin <span>$</span> <span>replicate</span> <span>1000</span> <span>$</span> forAll gen prop</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can rewrite the property <span>\(\exists (x,y) \left [ x \oplus y \neq y \oplus x \right ]\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1">    it <span>"is not commutative (via exists)"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">      exists <span>$</span> \(x,y) <span>-&gt;</span> x ⊕ y <span>/=</span> y ⊕ x</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I like how close the Haskell code stays to the concise mathematical formulation! The output of this test fits much better into our intuitive understanding:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">    <span>is</span> not commutative (via exists)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      <span>+++</span> OK, passed 1 test.</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="sequential-mapreduce">Sequential MapReduce</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify <strong>a map function</strong> that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, <strong>and a reduce function</strong> that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.</p>
<p>[This] abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp and many other functional languages. <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/16cb30b4b92fd4989b8619a61752a2387c6dd474.pdf">Quoted from Google Research</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not going into more details here, as You’ll find detailed information on this approach and a working example <a href="https://thma.github.io/posts/2018-11-24-lambda-the-ultimate-pattern-factory.html#map-reduce">in my original article</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the definition of a sequential MapReduce:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">simpleMapReduce </span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)   <span>-- map function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>-&gt;</span> ([b] <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-- reduce function</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>-&gt;</span> [a]        <span>-- list to map over</span></span>
<span id="cb12-5">  <span>-&gt;</span> c          <span>-- result</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">simpleMapReduce mapFunc reduceFunc <span>=</span> reduceFunc <span>.</span> <span>map</span> mapFunc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can test the sequential MapReduce algorithm with the following property based test:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">    it <span>"works correctly with a sequential map-reduce"</span> <span>$</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">      property <span>$</span> \a b c d <span>-&gt;</span> (simpleMapReduce <span>reverse</span> (<span>foldr</span> (⊕) <span>""</span>) [a,b,c,d]) </span>
<span id="cb13-3">                     <span>`shouldBe`</span> (<span>reverse</span> a) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> b) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> c) ⊕ (<span>reverse</span> d)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="excurs-foldmap">Excurs: foldMap</h3>
<p>What I have shown so far just demonstrates the general mechanism of chaining <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions without implying any parallel execution. Essentially we are chaining a <code>map</code> with a <code>fold</code> (i.e.&nbsp;reduction) function. In the Haskell base library there is a higher order function <code>foldMap</code> that covers exactly this pattern of chaining. Please note that <code>foldMap</code>does only a single traversal of the foldable data structure. It fuses the <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> phase into a single one by function composition of <code>mappend</code> and the mapping function <code>f</code>:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>-- | Map each element of the structure to a monoid,</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>-- and combine the results.</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3"><span>foldMap</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>foldMap</span> f <span>=</span> <span>foldr</span> (<span>mappend</span> <span>.</span> f) <span>mempty</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="parallel-mapreduce">Parallel MapReduce</h2>
<p>Now we come to the tricky part that kicked off this whole discussion: parallelism.</p>
<p>As an example we consider a simple sequential MapReduce, taking an input list of <code>Int</code>s, computing their squares and computing the sum of these squares:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> simpleMapReduce (<span>^</span><span>2</span>) (<span>foldr</span> (<span>+</span>) <span>0</span>) [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>]</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span>30</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s try to design this as a massively parallelized algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mapping of <code>(^2)</code> over the input-list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> would be started in parallel to the reduction of the intermediary list of squares by <code>(foldr (+) 0)</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The mapping phase will be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each element of the input list).</p></li>
<li><p>The reduction phase will also be executed as a set of parallel computations (one for each addition).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course the reduction phase can begin only when at least one list element is squared. So in effect the mapping process would have to start first. The parallel computation of squares will result in a non-deterministic sequence of computations. In particular it is not guaranteed that all elements of the input list are processed in the original list order. So it might for example …</p></div></div>

<p>In this post we’ll discuss how Spotify optimized and sped up elements from our largest Dataflow job, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/18/spotify-unwrapped-how-we-brought-you-a-decade-of-data/" target="_blank">Wrapped 2019</a>, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/genre/2020-page">Wrapped 2020</a> using a technique called Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) join. We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Shuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his <a href="http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf">2018 master’s thesis</a>, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html" target="_blank">Scio module</a> afterwards.</p>



<h2>Design and Implementation</h2>



<p>The majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spotify/scio" target="_blank">Scio</a>, a Scala API for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a>, and run on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google Cloud Dataflow</a> service. We implemented SMB in Java to be closer to the native Beam SDK (and even wrote and collaborated on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing">design document with the Beam community</a>), and provide Scala syntactic sugar in Scio like many other I/Os. The design is modularized into the main components listed below — we’ll start with the two top-level SMB <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTransforms</a> — the write and read operations SortedBucketSink and SortedBucketSource.</p>



<h3>SortedBucketSink</h3>



<p>This transform writes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections" target="_blank">PCollection</a>&lt;T&gt; (where T has a corresponding <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/FileOperations.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileOperations&lt;T&gt;</a> instance) in SMB format. It first extracts keys and assigns bucket IDs using logic provided by <a href="https://github.com/spotify/scio/blob/master/scio-smb/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/smb/BucketMetadata.java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BucketMetadata</a>, groups key–values by the ID, sorts all values, and then writes them into files corresponding to bucket IDs using the FileOperations instance.</p>



<p>In addition to the bucket files, a JSON file is also written to the output directory representing the information from BucketMetadata that’s necessary to read the source: the number of buckets, the hashing scheme, and the instructions to extract the key from each record (for example, for Avro records we can encode this instruction with the name of the GenericRecord field containing the key).</p>

<h3>SortedBucketSource</h3>



<p>This transform reads from one or more sources written in SMB format with the same key and hashing scheme. It opens file handles for corresponding buckets from each source (using FileOperations&lt;T&gt; for that input type) and merges them while maintaining sorted order. Results are emitted as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/join/CoGbkResult.java" target="_blank">CoGbkResult</a> objects per key group, the same class Beam uses for regular Cogroup operations, so the user can extract the results per source with the correct parameterized type.</p>

<h3>FileOperations</h3>



<p>FileOperations abstracts away the reading and writing of individual bucket files. Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.</p>



<h3>BucketMetadata</h3>



<p>This class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.</p>



<h3>Optimizations and Variants</h3>



<p>Over the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Date partitioning:</strong> At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories <em>per source</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Sharding:</strong> Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of <em>shards</em> to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence"><em>per bundle</em></a>. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:<ul><li><strong>Minimum parallelism,</strong> or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.</li><li><strong>Maximum parallelism,</strong> or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.</li><li><strong>Auto parallelism:</strong> Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>SortedBucketTransform:</strong> A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.</li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>External Sort:</strong> We made a number of improvements to Beam’s <a href="https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter">external sorter extension</a>, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Core Data Producers</h2>



<p>Since SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.</p>



<p>Implementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:</p>



<ul><li>Agree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.</li><li>Set compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.</li><li>Make sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.</li></ul>



<h2>Adoption — Wrapped 2020</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending some weeks playing with Rust, I felt ready to test my skills and try some programming challenges in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a>. My approach to tackle some of those challenges was to solve them using Javascript (I use it in my day to day) first and then port the code to Rust. While writing the port I just focus on getting the Rust code as elegant as possible to achieve that I research the Rust API's to get syntactically correct. It was after finishing porting this <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> in particular and feeling a sense of accomplishment that I decided to test how the Rust compiled code will perform against Javascript interpreter.</p><h2 id="naive-algorithm">Naive Algorithm</h2><hr><p>Before jumping to the whom-was-slower-and-why, let’s take a quick look at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5">puzzle</a> (so you see there is no hidden agenda) which goes like this:</p><p>You are given an input string with <code>N</code> amount of characters and we should write an algorithm that find and remove any sequential pairs of characters that similar but have different capitalisation, examples of this are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">bB <span># Remove</span>
bb <span># Do Nothing</span>
ab <span># Do Nothing</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The algorithm should re-evaluate the string recursively searching for new pairs created after the removal, something like tetris.</p><p>We have this input:</p><p>We should remove <code>bB</code> to get:</p><p>Then because <code>aA</code> has been formed we should eliminated this too:</p><p>Then we remove <code>dD</code> and the final string should be:</p><h3 id="my-solution">My Solution</h3><p>To solve this I wrote two functions, one that <code>process</code> takes array of characters, traverse the array a pair at a time and validate that they follow the rules mentioned above:</p><h4 id="rust">Rust</h4><hr><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>process</span>(tokens: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>String<span>&gt;</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {

My first reaction (in an act of self denial) was to check the compiler flags <code>opt-level</code> and after checking that was fine, which to be honest won’t make a difference, I started to look for inefficiencies in the code, first using the ancient <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html">Drunk man anti-method</a> technique and when that didn’t work, I end up settling for a more scientific method of profiling my code with <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a>.</p><h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2><hr><p>Every time you are debugging a performance issues you might feel tempted to start adding your own function to calculate the duration of suspicious section of code (like I used to do, in the past). <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">Perf</a> does this for you by taking various approaches such as listening to CPU/Kernel <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/developer_guide/perf">performance events</a> metrics emitted by the system in reaction of your process while running.

<p><strong>Update 1:58 AM PT:</strong> <em>Updated the post to clear confusion about how Google’s Safe Browsing feature works.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Apple’s privacy push is much more widespread than it seems at the surface. A perfect example is the new privacy feature in <a href="https://the8-bit.com/ios-14-5-changes/">iOS 14.5 Beta 1 (V2)</a> which redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance users’ privacy and to not let Google see your IP address. </p>
<p>Google Safe Browsing is a security service created by Google that checks whether a website is malicious. When you access a website on the desktop version of Chrome on your Mac or PC, for instance, Google Safe Browsing checks if a website is safe to browse and displays a warning accordingly. The user ultimately has the choice, however.</p>
<p>As Reddit user u/jaydenkieran explains, Apple uses Google Safe Browsing when you enable “Fraudulent Website Warning” within the Safari settings in the Settings app on iPhone or iPad.</p>

If it does, it’s added to Google’s online database. Google also identifies phishing websites by using statistical models. </p>
<p><a aria-label="According to Apple (opens in a new tab)" href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT210675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Apple</a>, before visiting a website, Safari may send hashed prefixes of the URL (Apple terms it “information calculated from the website address”) to Google Safe Browsing to check if there’s a match. </p>
<p>Since Apple uses a hashed prefix, Google cannot learn which website the user is trying to visit. Up until iOS 14.5, Google could also see the IP address of where that request is coming from. However, since Apple now proxies Google Safe Browsing traffic, it further safeguards users’ privacy while browsing using Safari.</p>
<p>Apple has been intensifying its push for privacy with iOS 14 what with the <a href="https://the8-bit.com/app-tracking-transparency-guide/">App Tracking Transparency update and the inclusion of App Privacy Reports in the App Store</a>. </p><div><p>See also</p><div id="block-wrap-39225" data-id="39225" data-base="0"><div><div><div><article><div><p><a href="https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/" title="Siri_Default_Music_App"><img width="100" height="100" src="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg" alt="Siri Default Music App" srcset="https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-100x100.jpg 100w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-80x80.jpg 80w, https://the8-bit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Siri_Default_Music_App-293x293.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"></a></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>At the same time, companies like Facebook are actively opposing the Cupertino giant, accusing it of negatively affecting the advertising industry. Apple’s response has been simple: </p>
<p>“We believe that this is a simple matter of standing up for our users. Users should know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites — and they should have the choice to allow that or not. App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 does not require Facebook to change its approach to tracking users and creating targeted advertising, it simply requires they give users a choice.” </p>
<p>Google itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/google-still-hasnt-updated-its-ios-apps-while-pondering-android-privacy-controls" target="_blank" aria-label="had been holding off (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been holding off</a> on updating its host of apps on the App Store due to the App Privacy Health Reports in the App Store that lets users view how an app tracks them. However, Google later disclosed that it will update its apps to include as little tracking as possible.</p>
<p>Having said that, it’s interesting to see Apple focus on enhancing user privacy as much as they can. And setting up a proxy server to filter Google Safe Browsing traffic just so Google cannot see users’ browsing activity will be a welcome move for a lot of users.</p>

February 11, 2021 | https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2021/02/10/mozilla.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I don’t think any little girl grows up with the goal of “I want to be an OSS Android browser developer” and to be totally honest, even as an adult I just kind of fell into it. I first joined Mozilla as an intern during my change-career journey mainly because I had taken one Android class, knew some Java, and applied on a whim at the right time to hit the recruiter’s inbox. Despite not actively seeking Mozilla or Android out, I immediately fell in love with the project and team and knew I had stumbled into a very special place. The problems were interesting, I had opportunities for leadership and growth from the start, and the people were kind, smart, and supportive.</p>

<p>At Mozilla you’ll meet the smartest and most passionate people who could be tech leaders at any other major company (and almost certainly make more money) but are choosing to work specifically on Firefox because they believe in the product and the mission. It’s definitely intimidating to come in as an intern to one of the original “software companies” but everyone I’ve met is truly wonderful and welcoming. It was (mostly) fun to be the underdog and celebrate our wins, large and small alike. I felt connected to the mission and the products we were creating. I felt like I had a large impact in my team after only a short amount of time (most teams are quite small and tight-knit). The fans and the community were passionate and many times I had the cool experience of wearing a Firefox t-shirt in public and people thanking me for my work (now that I’m writing this, it feels a bit odd. I guess you had to be there).</p>

<p>So if it’s so great then why am I leaving? I know it’s not a satisfying answer, verging on cliche, but I’m just looking to do something new. That and.. I am also extremely burnt out. The very small mobile team has been through a gauntlet in order to ship a full rewrite of the flagship Firefox for Android browser (partly during the pandemic no less). Working too much during the week for the last 2 years was normal for me and while never asked for from my team, I cared deeply about the product and the success and it would have been impossible to hit our deadlines and ship something I was proud of without it. And when we finally did ship, I WAS proud of our team and what we had accomplished, but the release just felt like a blip in our planned schedule before jumping into more sprints and fires and thinking about the next iteration.</p>

<p>I did take one week of PTO right after our release! … which just so happened to be the week that the large layoffs happened. I was safe from layoffs, but morale plummeted, and I was definitely not refreshed. The cherry on top was being specifically targeted for harassment that same week after the release by unhappy users of Firefox looking for someone to direct their frustrations at<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup>. There’s nothing that Mozilla really could have done in this scenario, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth after all of the blood, sweat, and tears I had put into this project. For someone who thought of themselves as an empathetic dev overworking myself FOR the end users and product, this hurt and I’m not sure I ever really recovered. While the pace is slowing down now and there’s a promise of no more deadline crunches, I just feel that I haven’t been able to catch my breath no matter how much time I take off. Whether that’s the project, pandemic fatigue, or all of the above, I’m very ready for a break, a fresh start, and a change of pace.</p>

<p>Working in open source full-time has been an incredible experience that has had its extreme ups and downs. On the positive side, I’ve loved mentoring new contributors to get their first open source PR merged. I’ve enjoyed all the positive interactions with the lovely community volunteers who care as much about making the product better as I do. On the negative side, it has become increasingly hard for me to separate work from not work. I found myself “contributing” (read - working) at all hours of the day. Replying to issues, emails, and public chats when I was in bed at midnight, when I just woke up at 7am, in the car on the way to go hiking on the weekend, and then while ON the hike. This might be a me problem, but boundary setting when there’s a public repo always getting new issues, comments, emails, and chatroom messages was difficult for me. And of course not all of those messages are nice; the constant stream of negative comments from unhappy and rude users during the work week and outside of it was extremely draining. Besides politicians, this might be one of the only jobs where you can wake up to an inbox full of emails and messages about how much everyone thinks you suck at your job. You definitely grow a thick skin quickly, but it’s still exhausting.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people tend to forget that Mozilla was also my very first job in tech. I learned so much there and there’s always more I could learn, but it’s good to try new experiences and face new problems, especially early in my career. I will be forever grateful for the experiences I’ve had at Mozilla and the people I’ve met. It was my “big break” into tech and I will never forget that! I will keep using and supporting Firefox and take a lot of the Mozilla ideals with me wherever I go. My experience was super formative for how I view ethics, privacy, and other important issues inside the tech space.</p>

<p>I am excited about my break and my next adventure but I’m definitely very sad to be leaving Mozilla and the wonderful people. The (good) problem with working with people who are true friends is it’s painful when people leave, including yourself. I will miss everyone dearly, especially all of my mobile team peers. I hope you all stay in touch and our paths cross again once conferences are a thing again (or maybe I’ll just crash the next All Hands, I’m not above it). If you’re at Mozilla and want to say goodbye, please ping me in the next 2 weeks! I’ve also heard I’m quite easy to find online! 😉</p>

<p>Love you all ❤️ XOXO</p>

<p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: EDIT: Saw this made it onto Hacker News and people in the comments were doubting this harassment happened. Classic. I documented it well on my Twitter at the time, but I’m happy to give more context. I tweeted around the time of release that I was proud of the team for all our hard work and I’m not “worrying about the haters” with a photo of me drinking a beer and flipping off the camera. I never referenced users. “Haters” is just a saying that the youngins say that isn’t specific but according to the internet, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hater-4589594">“a hater is a slang term used in everyday language and especially online to describe an individual who talks and behaves negatively in response to other people’s success and goal achievement.”</a> It was a light-hearted joke for my Twitter friends after a year of hard work and constant negativity. In response this tweet was posted all over Reddit and 4chan and then there were coordinated doxxing attacks, multiple 4chan threads full of violent sexual and death threats, troll PRs opened in our repo, all of my photos pulled off of my Instagram and posted into these threads with disgusting commentary, and actual calls to my work from fake “journalists” to try to get me fired. I’m not going to post the comments here because they make me sick but feel free to search the archives to see for yourself. If you think this is ever an appropriate response to a dev on the team telling a joke online, I can’t help you.</p>

Converting to a standard, machine-readable format makes them easier to search, analyze, join with other data and to calculate differences.</p><p>When working through the normalization process for an API, we generally work with 3 forms of each response:</p><ol><li>The original <strong>source</strong> form, verbatim (or as verbatim as the API allows). This is usually a string, including whitespace, comments, etc. The value of the keeping the source format varies - it's usually important for YAML but less important for JSON, for example. </li><li>The <strong>object</strong> form - A 'usable' form where the source (which is usually a string) is transformed into an object that can be manipulated in a standard way. Such transformation may be lossy - duplicate keys may be removed, comments are typically not included, etc. For steampipe, this format is typically <code>jsonb</code>.</li><li>A <strong>standard</strong> form - A single, canonical form that objects are converted to. The <strong>source</strong> and <strong>object</strong> forms may allow multiple syntaxes to represent a single semantic meaning. In such cases, converting all of these equivalent syntaxes to a single format simplifies and optimizes searching, comparing, and analyzing the object. </li></ol><p>Note that which forms are important vary by API, object, etc. For AWS IAM policies, Steampipe currently returns the object form (in the <code>policy</code> column) and the standardized form as <code>policy_std</code>. Because the source form is JSON and it sufficiently similar to the object form, we do not currently include it. </p><p>Many of the AWS IAM policy elements in the object form may be single elements or arrays. To search these elements, you don't just need to look for values, you would need to evaluate the <strong>structure</strong> of the result as well. For example, let's says you want to search for policies that allow the <code>s3:DeleteBucket</code> action. Without the standard form, you would need to look for both cases:</p><ul><li>Where the action is a string, and has value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div><br></li><li>Where the action is an array, and the array includes the value <code>"s3:DeleteBucket"</code><div><div><div><div><div><pre><code><p><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:CreateBucket"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>"s3:DeleteBucket"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></li></ul><p>In fact, the real world situation is even more complex - The action value may be any case, the resource may also be either string or array, etc. By converting policies to a single, standardized format, Steampipe makes it easier to find what you are looking for regardless of the source format.</p><h2 id="baseline-normalization-rules">Baseline Normalization Rules</h2><p>The general guidelines for building the standard policy are:</p><ol><li>Normalize the structure.

</a></p>
<p>Class destructors have painful <a href="#The-trouble-with-class-destructors">limitations</a> when called by the GC.
</p>
<p>But there is a way to make a class holding a resource that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>works with scoped ownership (<code>std.typecons.RefCounted</code>, <code>std.typecons.Unique</code>, <code>std.typecons.Scoped</code>)
</li>
<li>works with manual release (<code>object.destroy</code>)
</li>
<li>warns when the GC call the destructor and then release the resource, which is <em>coincidental correctness</em> and dangerous to rely on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea behind the <strong>GC-proof resource class</strong> is to check why the destructor was called and act accordingly.
</p>
<pre><code>class MyGCProofResource
{
    void* handle;

    this()
    {
        // acquire resource
        handle = create_handle();
    }

    ~this()
    {
        // Important bit.
        // Here we verify that the GC isn't responsible
        // for releasing the resource, which is dangerous.
        import core.memory;
        assert(!GC.inFinalizer, "Error: clean-up of MyGCProofResource incorrectly" ~
                                " depends on destructors called by the GC");

        // release resource
        free_handle(handle);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You'll get a clear message whenever you rely on the GC to release resources.
</p>
<p>This idiom was first introduced in the <a href="https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm">GFM</a> library.
</p>
</div><div><p><a href="#Don't-use-@property">Link
</a></p>
<p>The current agreement on best practices with regards to <code>@property</code> is to <strong>not use it.</strong>
</p>

</a></p>
<p>It just happens that in D you can't use <code>new</code> to get a pointer to a newly allocated static array.
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

    // This line does not compile!
    // Error: new can only create structs, dynamic arrays or class objects, not int[4]'s
    auto t = new T; 
}
</code></pre><p><em>"You can only call new with structs, dynamic arrays, and class objects"</em> says the compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated:</strong> actually the compiler is lying a bit, since it is possible to allocate a single (builtin type) value on the heap:
</p>
<pre><code>void main()
{
    int* p = new int;  // Works
}
</code></pre><p>But this can't be with static arrays, despite them being <a href="#Static-arrays-are-value-types">value types</a>. Doesn't that sound like an inconsistency? Something that would have to be <strong>explained.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>The reasoning for <code>new</code> and static arrays was probably that you rarely really want to allocate a static array on the heap; it could just as well be a slice.
</p>
<p><strong>So there is no syntax to do this</strong>.<br>When you do write <code>new int[4]</code> this will instead return an <code>int[]</code> <em>slice</em> with a length of 4, which adds the benefits of holding a length.
</p>
<pre><code>writeln(typeof(new int[4]).stringof); // output: "int[]"

auto arr = new int[4];
writeln(arr.length); // output: "4"
arr ~= 42;
writeln(arr.length); // output: "5"
</code></pre><p>So far, so good. 
</p>
<p><a href="#Type-qualifiers-and-slices-creation">It gets weirder</a> whenever <code>shared</code>, <code>const</code> and <code>immutable</code> get introduced...
</p>
<h2 id="do-it-anyway"> Do it anyway</h2>
<p>If for some reason you really need a <em>static</em> array allocated on the heap instead of a slice, you can do it anyway by using <code>std.experimental.allocator</code> (or its DUB equivalent <a href="https://code.dlang.org/packages/stdx-allocator">stdx-allocator</a>):
</p>
<pre><code>import std.experimental.allocator;

void main()
{
    alias T = int[4];

 // T* t = new T;                 // Won't work.
    T* t = theAllocator.make!T;   // Fine!
    assert((*t).length == 4);     // Safe too.

    (*t)[1] = 42;                 // Needs pointer dereference and parentheses before use.
    assert(*t == [0, 42, 0, 0]);  // Features default initialization.
    
 // (*t) ~= 43; // Error: cannot append type int to type int[4]

</a></p>
<p>A <em>Voldemort type</em> is simply a type that can't be named by the user.
</p>
<h2 id="an-example-from-ae-utils-graphics"> An example from <code>ae.utils.graphics</code>:</h2>
<pre><code>template procedural(alias formula)
{
    alias fun = binaryFun!(formula, "x", "y");
    alias Color = typeof(fun(0, 0));

    // Returning auto is necessary here.
    // Procedural can't be named outside of the procedural function.
    auto procedural()
    {
        struct Procedural
        {
            auto ref Color opIndex(int x, int y)
            {
                return fun(x, y);
            }
        }
        return Procedural();
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Outside of the <code>procedural</code> function of this <a href="#Eponymous-templates">eponymous template</a>, there is no way to name <code>Procedural</code>. Therefore, <strong>Voldemort types can only be passed around in auto variables or auto returns.</strong>
</p>
<h2 id="why"> Why?</h2>
<p>Hiding information about types. Because the user can't name or instantiate Voldemort types at will, expressions in a Voldemort lazy computation chain can change types without changing user code.
</p>
<p>Voldemort types were promoted and named by Andrei Alexandrescu. They are typically used in chains of lazy computations, like ranges.

<p>When a slice is created with <code>new</code> and a type qualifier, the qualifier applies to <em>pointed elements</em> <br>instead of the whole slice as would be expected.
</p>
<pre><code>import std.stdio;

void main(string[] args)
{
    // Output: "const(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new const(int[4])).stringof);

    writeln(typeof(new immutable(int[4])).stringof);
    
    // Output: "shared(int)[]"
    writeln(typeof(new shared(int[4])).stringof);
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> this syntax <a href="#One-does-not-simply-call-new-for-static-arrays">doesn't return pointers to static arrays</a> but indeed return a slice.

</a></p>
<p><em>(Note: on this whole website, with "static arrays" we mean fixed-size arrays, not arrays declared with</em> <code>static</code><em>).</em>

<p>It's important to note that D static arrays are value types.

{
    arr[] += 4;           // Only the local version is modified.

    addFour(a);           // a is passed by value on the stack, not by pointer.
    assert(a[0] == 0);

</p>
<h2 id="static-arrays-convert-implicitely-into-slices"> Static arrays convert implicitely into slices!</h2>
<p>To pass static arrays by reference, either write a function taking a slice or use ref.

    addSix(a);          // Works, a is converted into a slice referencing the same data

February 11, 2021 | https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Detecting people’s names is part and parcel of PII discovery. Traditional techniques like regexps and keywords don’t work, because the set of all names is too varied. How do open source Named Entity Recognition (NER) engines compare, and can we do better?</p><p>
<em>This Part 1 has NER results and benchmarks. There’s also <a href="https://pii-tools.com/detect-person-names-in-text-part-2-technical/">Part 2 with technical neural network details</a>.<br>
</em></p><h2 id="sota_ner">Developing a state-of-the-art named entity recognizer</h2><p>
A good named entity recognizer (NER) is essential for detecting names, home addresses, <a href="https://twitter.com/PII_tools/status/1230905790745260032">passport scans</a> etc, for purposes of compliance or <a href="https://pii-tools.com/pii-exclusions-data-breach/">breach incident management</a>.</p><p>
One could use a prepared list of names and surnames for this task, but such gazetteer obviously cannot be exhaustive and will fail on sentences like this:</p><blockquote><p>“<b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.”</p></blockquote><p>Humans recognize easily what is a person’s name and what isn’t. For machines, the task is more difficult because they have trouble understanding context. This leads to the famous two types of errors:</p><ul><li><strong>False positives</strong>: words detected as personal names that are not, typically because they’re capitalized (<code>"Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands."</code>); as well as</li><li><strong>False negatives</strong>: names missed by the detection, typically because they’re lowercased, foreign or uncommon. Example: <code>"bill carpenter was playing football."</code></li></ul><p>
So in order to recognize person names in text it is necessary to know not only what names look like, but also in what context they’re used and have a general domain knowledge.</p><h2 id="motivation">Why not just use open source?</h2><p>
NER is a well-studied task in academia. Naturally, we turned to open source NER solutions first. We evaluated the most popular ready-made software: Stanford NER and Stanza from the Stanford University, FLAIR from Zalando Research, spaCy from Explosion AI.</p><p>
To cut the story short, <strong>none of these open source tools were precise and fast enough</strong> for our purposes. While they work great on well-behaved data such as news articles or Wikipedia, their academic pedigree implodes when applied to the wild, messy documents of the real world.</p><p>
For this reason we developed our own NER, with special focus on <strong>names as they appear in real company documents</strong>. The resulting NER is proprietary (part of <a href="https://pii-tools.com/">PII Tools</a>) but we decided to share some technical design tips and results here, in the hope they help others.</p><p>
In this article, we’ll compare our creation against popular open source options. Additionally, we’ll benchmark a simple gazetteer-based NER that uses a predefined list of names, to serve as a <strong>baseline</strong>.</p><table><caption>Description of tested NERs</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>version</th><th>type</th><th>language</th><th>source</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>–</td><td><abbr title="contains 5.6M unique names">list of names</abbr></td><td>multi-language</td><td>inhouse</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>4.1</td><td>CRF classifier</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html</a></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>1.1.1</td><td>neural network</td><td><abbr title="each language has a separate model">single</abbr></td><td><a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/">https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="ner-multi-fast model">flair</abbr></th><td>0.6.1</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair">https://github.com/flairNLP/flair</a></td></tr><tr><th><abbr title="xx_ent_wiki_sm model">spacy</abbr></th><td>2.3.2</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a></td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>3.8.0</td><td>neural network</td><td>multi-language</td><td><a href="https://pii-tools.com/">https://pii-tools.com/</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Our requirements for the new NER were:</p><ul><li><strong>multi-language</strong>, with special focus on English, Spanish, German and Portuguese/Brazilian;</li><li>to accept <strong>arbitrary document contexts</strong>: text coming from PDFs, Word documents, Excel, email, database field, OCR…;</li><li><strong>efficient</strong>, to process <strong>large amounts of text quickly on a CPU</strong> (no need for specialized GPU hardware) and with a <strong>low memory footprint</strong>,</li><li><strong>flexible</strong> to be able to evolve the model behaviour: retraining, adding new languages, correcting detection errors;</li><li>and of course to be <strong>accurate</strong>, to minimize false positives and negatives.</li></ul><p>
To compare our NER we evaluated performance on standard benchmark datasets, <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/">CoNLL-2002</a> (for Spanish), <a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/">CoNLL-2003</a> (English, German) and <a href="https://cic.unb.br/~teodecampos/LeNER-Br/">LeNER-Br</a> (Portuguese).</p><p>We also included a manually annotated <code>openweb</code> dataset, to make sure we test on data that no NER system (including ours!) has seen during training. Text for this dataset was randomly sampled from the English <a href="https://skylion007.github.io/OpenWebTextCorpus/">OpenWebTextCorpus</a>. We value results on <code>openweb</code> the most, because OpenWeb reflects the real (messy) data found in real documents the closest, among these public datasets.</p><h2 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2><p>
We measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score">F1 scores</a> for person names detected by each software. F1 scores range from 0 to 100, the higher the better. A “hit” (true positive) means the entire name was matched exactly, beginning to end. This is the strictest metric; we specifically <emph>don’t</emph> calculate success over the number of correctly predicted tokens, or even individual characters.</p><table><caption>Performance benchmark [F1 score – higher is better]</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>English</th><th>Spanish</th><th>German</th><th>Portuguese</th><th>openweb</th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>59.1</td><td>62.3</td><td>54.9</td><td>45.2</td><td>74.5</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>94.9</td><td>91.1</td><td>93.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>92.6</td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>82.2</td><td>98.4</td><td>87.6</td><td><abbr title="no model available">—</abbr></td><td>86.7</td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>95.8</td><td>96.9</td><td>91.3</td><td>62.9</td><td>90.6</td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>86.1</td><td>87.0</td><td>74.1</td><td>42.0</td><td>81.3</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>92.3</td><td>90.6</td><td>89.3</td><td>85.9</td><td>95.7</td></tr></tbody></table><div id="attachment_4542"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4542" loading="lazy" src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" alt="F1 scores for NER software that detect personal names." width="1015" height="482" srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" data-srcset="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png 1015w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-300x142.png 300w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-768x365.png 768w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-100x47.png 100w, https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1-924x439.png 924w" data-src="https://pii-tools.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-f1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p id="caption-attachment-4542">F1 scores of NER software that detect person names.</p></div><p>
In all tests our NER is among the top contenders – but keep in mind that accuracy was just one of our 5 design goals. For example, we “lost” a few F1 points on purpose by switching from Tensorflow to TF lite, trading accuracy for a much smaller &amp; faster model.</p><p>
For the Portuguese language (Brazil, LGPD) and <code>openweb</code> dataset, PII Tools is the clear winner. As mentioned above <code>openweb</code> reflects “real data” the closest, so this is great.</p><p>
Let’s look at some concrete examples:</p><table><caption>Text samples and NER detections (actual expected names are <strong>in bold</strong>)</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>stanford</th><th>stanza</th><th>flair</th><th>spacy</th><th>pii-tools</th></tr><tr><td><b>Calvin Klein</b> founded Calvin Klein Company in 1968.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nawab Zulfikar Ali Magsi</b> did not see <b>Shama Parveen Magsi</b> coming.</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><b>bill carpenter</b> was playing football.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td><abbr title="a village in Wales">Llanfihangel Talyllyn</abbr> is beautiful.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>ok</td></tr><tr><td>Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands.</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td><td>fail</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
These samples are rather edge cases, but serve to get an idea of what detectors have to deal with, and how successful they are.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>
Now we will look into other aspects of our requirements. Detection performance was measured on CPU, our <code>pii-tools</code> NER was artificially restricted to a single process with a single thread, others were left in default settings.</p><table><caption>Speed and memory comparison</caption><tbody><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th><abbr title="short documents of ~500 bytes">speed short [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="long documents of ~2.5 kB">speed long [kB/s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="time to initializate NER + tag a 20 character text">startup time [s]</abbr></th><th><abbr title="peak RAM while tagging 270 kB of text">RAM usage [MB]</abbr></th></tr><tr><th>list</th><td>350.0</td><td>1100.0</td><td>1.1</td><td>1420</td></tr><tr><th>stanford</th><td>30.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>1.5</td><td><abbr title="for one language only">248</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>stanza</th><td>0.4</td><td>1.2</td><td>6.1</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">1073</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>flair</th><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td><td>5.2</td><td><abbr title="input had to be chunked to limit RAM">5341</abbr></td></tr><tr><th>spacy</th><td>70.0</td><td>200.0</td><td>0.5</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><th>pii-tools</th><td>35.0</td><td>230.0</td><td>1.3</td><td>387</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Overall FLAIR and Stanza are definitely out, due to their super slow speed and high RAM usage. A worthy competitor from the performance perspective is spaCy, whose authors put a great deal of effort into optimization. Unfortunately spaCy’s tokenization quirks and opinionated architecture proved too inflexible for our needs.</p><p>
Likewise, Stanford NER is the most accurate among the open source alternatives, but is quite rigid – it’s really hard to update its models or add a new language. Plus its GNU GPL license won’t be to everyone’s liking.</p><h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2><p>
Our focus on industry use calls for frequent model modifications: adding new languages, new kinds of documents (document contexts in which names may appear), fixing detection errors.</p><p>
In order to adapt the PII Tools NER model quickly, we built a pipeline that utilizes several “weaker” NERs and automatic translation tools to build a huge training corpus from varied sources. This focus on real-world data, along with a robust automated Tensorflow training pipeline allows adding new languages and controlling NER outputs more easily than the open source solutions.</p><p>
While developing our <code>pii-tools</code> NER we implemented most components from scratch, including:</p><ul><li>a large scale annotated dataset (proprietary data)</li><li>a tokenizer (critical; none of the open source variants do this part well)</li><li>token features (input to the neural network)</li><li>convolutional neural network (NN architecture)</li><li>data augmentation and training pipeline (for grounded model updates)</li><li>various tricks to push performance or to squeeze a lot of information into a smaller parameter space</li></ul><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I want to outline the tools I use to consume textual content, and why it <em>perfectly</em> fits my needs.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe this can be helpful for you too.</p>

<p>(This should have been a pun on “HTTPS everywhere”…)</p>
<p>Been an avid RSS consumer for the past years.</p>
<p>But I’ve always encountered the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>lost RSS feeds while distro-hopping (either forgot or lost backups of the config files)</li>
<li>didn’t like the RSS reader’s UI</li>
<li>needed to install an extra native application for reading my news (both on my PC and phone)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Yes, I know you could use Feedly, Reedr and others, but it didn’t suit my needs)</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-web"><a href="#embrace-the-web">#</a> Embrace the Web</h3>
<p>I am a web-guy (whatever that means).</p>
<p>I almost exclusively use the Web, be it for apps one would have a native app for or browsing in general.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve found my perfect stack for keeping up to date with the latest news:</p>
<p>RSS for</p>
<ul>
<li>blogs (obviously)</li>
<li>HackerNews frontpage (yes, there is an RSS for it)</li>
<li>Twitter (although I added only a few feeds, via Nitter RSS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hackernews-frontpage"><a href="#hackernews-frontpage">#</a> HackerNews frontpage</h3>
<p>I found myself checking the HN frontpage <strong>way</strong> too often, only to make a visual diff in my brain to skim through the articles I already read.</p>
<p>This changed finally once I discovered HN-RSS:</p>
<p>E.g. I get all posts that make it to the HackerNews frontpage via this RSS feed</p>
<pre><code>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</code></pre>
<h3 id="tweets"><a href="#tweets">#</a> Tweets</h3>
<p>And the tweets from a handful of Twitter users through Nitter’s RSS feeds:</p>
<pre><code>https://nitter.eu/&lt;TWITTER_HANDLE&gt;/rss
</code></pre>
<p>You can host your own instance if you prefer, or choose one from any other <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">public one’s</a></p>
<h2 id="miniflux-to-the-rescue"><a href="#miniflux-to-the-rescue">#</a> Miniflux to the rescue</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The awesome part of <a href="https://miniflux.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">miniflux</a> is that I can</p>
<ul>
<li>self-host it (a baby could run it via docker and set up a reverse-proxy with nginx)</li>
<li>Integrate Pocket (<a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">getpocket.com</a>) for bookmarking articles or reading them later on</li>
<li>Read the whole article without leaving Miniflux</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last point is because Miniflux will fetch the original article automatically if the RSS entry only contains a summary)</p>
<p>You want other reasons?</p>
<p>Privacy, simplicity, clean and no-frills UI, FOSS</p>
<p>This is how the UI looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-example.png" alt="miniflux example"></p>
<p>By clicking on the article I can read it in full.</p>
<p>I use the <code>Save</code> button to offload the articles to Pocket, and read them later.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarklet"><a href="#bookmarklet">#</a> Bookmarklet</h3>
<p>Through a simple bookmark in my browser (both on PC and phone), I can simply subscribe to any website or blog that has an RSS feed.</p>
<p>This makes it super easy to subscribe to someone’s RSS feed.</p>
<p>You stumble upon an article, click on the bookmarklet, and Miniflux will find the RSS feed(s) for that website automatically.</p>
<p>No searching for the RSS icon no more.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/miniflux-bookmarklet.png" alt="miniflux bookmarklet"></p>
<h2 id="pocket-(%23longreads)"><a href="#pocket-(%23longreads)">#</a> Pocket (#longreads)</h2>
<p>I set up the Pocket integration mainly for reading longer articles, in a deferred fashion.</p>
<p>Pocket’s UI and reading experience suits me very well.</p>
<p>This part is totally optional, as you could get away with it by just using Miniflux.</p>
<p>You could also customize the CSS to make the font-rendering more pleasant and use custom fonts for example.</p>
<h2 id="you-want-to-try-it-too%3F"><a href="#you-want-to-try-it-too%3F">#</a> You want to try it too?</h2>
<p>Below is the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> I am using.</p>
<p>(just generate a secure password for postgres, define an admin user, and optionally set the <code>POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY</code> variable)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article data-theme="classic" id="article"><header><h2>Or, "Any excuse to talk about folk music"</h2><h3>by <a href="https://senryu.pub/users/robotmay">Robert May</a> on <a href="https://senryu.pub/afternoonrobot/articles">Afternoon Robot</a></h3></header><section><h2>Background</h2>

<p>A few years ago I had quite bad RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) caused by working entirely on a small laptop for 6 months. It was a mistake for many reasons, but the major one was that I had inadvertantly changed my typing style to work with it. I was resting my wrists on the laptop case, I was using the touchpad, and I had it quite close to my body because it was small. I had to make a fairly dramatic change to halt the onset of the RSI, but at the time I didn't understand what I had done to cause it - after all, I've been typing a lot, at a reasonable speed, since I was ~10 years old.</p>

<p>It took 20 years, but finally I had suffered the consequences of my constant computer use.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>Immediately I set out to spend money. The first change I made was to buy an "ergonomic" keyboard, and I went for an <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>, which is a nice bit of kit. I also bought a wireless trackball; a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html">Logitech MX Ergo</a>. I'm now on my second of these and I really like it.</p>

<p>At the same time I started trying to learn the <a href="https://workmanlayout.org/">Workman</a> layout, which I think is largely rather smart, and which focuses on home-row typing. I initially tried Colemak but that seems oddly flawed in applying too much frequency to keys under the little fingers.</p>

<p>After some time, rather wonderfully, my RSI was substantially improved.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually for the reasons I originally thought. In fact, the RSI started disappearing because I essentially took a 3 month break from typing a lot, due to the high learning curve of swapping to a split board and new layout at the same time. Once I was back up to speed, the RSI started coming back.</p>

<h2>Why does it still hurt?</h2>

<p>Had I broken my body irreparably? No, as it turns out. In fact, all I had to do was just go back to everything I was doing before the laptop incident, and give myself time.</p>

<h3>As in all things, folk music is the cure</h3>

<p>Discovering the real cause of the problem came about by comparing typing on a computer to my musical instruments. I never get RSI on my diatonic accordions, or on the piano. Why are they different? Surely they use the same muscles, more or less. In fact their key weight is notably heavier. Even more weirdly, my RSI was non-existent when I played on them, even when it was at its worst on the computer.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to play the diatonic accordion but I tend to use a single strap and use the weight of the instrument to allow me to shift my hands whilst still holding it relatively still; I prefer this to strapping it tightly to my body and having entirely free hands. Here's an example video from a few years back:</p>



<p>There are better tunes and examples I could make but that would involve filming something new and I had this lying about. This video is a fairly good example in that I regularly slide my hand quickly downwards instead of stretching. It's more tempting to stretch when first learning the instrument as you don't want to lose your reference point, but learning to shift up and down the keys makes more difficult passages playable and actually quite comfortable. It's generally more comfortable to keep your fingers straight-ish and shift your hand up and down in that position. I now do this even more than in this video and regularly play tunes that use the full length of the keyboard. In fact, they're often my favourite ones to play! I now usually play with my thumb behind the keyboard, which I find makes it very easy to slide up and down. Here's another, rougher, old example, sure to give you motion sickness, from when I was selling an unwanted instrument:</p>



<p>Yes, accordions are a very quick way to ruin a motion-stabilisation algorithm-writer's day.</p>

<p>The hands aren't as free-floating as on a piano, as you have to hold the instrument at the same time. The key weight is actually fairly comparable to a computer keyboard, though at the heavier end. The piano is different, in that the key weight is actually pretty immense, particularly at the lower-end on a grand piano keyboard, and therefore requires a somewhat different method of striking the keys to a computer keyboard - the strength doesn't come from moving your finger up and down (but I won't go into that here as there are a million piano ergonomics articles).</p>

<h3>Problems with ergonomic or split keyboards</h3>

<p>The primary goal of many ergonomic keyboard enthusiasts is to reduce movement entirely and to move everything onto modifier layers. The Ergodox is known to be flawed in this regard as the thumb cluster is a bit of a stretch for most people, as well as the larger keys around the outside being a bit of an odd stretch. It's almost like it has two competing designs: one to reduce movement entirely, and the other to require movement in order to hit these extra buttons.</p>

<p>But the major flaw for me is that it ensures you can only ever use each hand on one half of the keyboard, and this means that keys which could often be a shared workload, such as <code>T,Y,G,H,B</code> are now dedicated to a hand. This is also a flaw I see with the "ortho-linear" layouts which remove key staggering. The argument for these optimisations is to remove stretching, which I agree with, but they do it by reducing movement, which I don't.</p>

<p>Instead of forcibly splitting the workload, I share it even more between my hands. But not by stretching! Instead my hands move freely over the keyboard, picking up letters or symbols in awkward places without having to perform difficult stretches with my fingers.</p>

<h3>The problem with home-row typing</h3>

<p>In my personal experience I found home-row typing to actually be unergonomic mostly because of the additional bend required from moving both hands closer together. This produces more strain on your wrist in order for your hand to be straighter on the keyboard. This is one aspect the split-keyboard design does solve, but it's also solvable on a normal keyboard.</p>

<p>It can be alleviated somewhat by moving the keyboard further away from you, allowing your wrists to be straighter. This however often means applying more pressure to the under-side of the wrist or arm as holding the weight of your hands further from your body is more tiring.</p>

<p>Instead I looked back at how I used to type, and realised that although my left hand sat more-or-less in the home-row position, i.e. with the index finger on <code>F</code>, my right hand sat further to the right, with the index finger somewhere between <code>K</code> and <code>L</code>. This is a wider "stance" and results in straighter wrists, as well as less stretching required for the <code>Enter</code> and <code>Right Shift</code> keys.</p>

<h2>This is the Way</h2>

<p>Looking at both instruments and reflecting on how I had typed before <em>The Laptop, First-born of Satan</em>, I settled on some ideas that are completely contrary to the accepted ergonomics of typing:</p>

<ol>
<li>The wrists themselves should not be under strain or pressure, including wrist-rests</li>
<li>The hands should move freely over the keyboard</li>
<li>The idea of "less movement" is incorrect, and instead I should aim for "less stretching"</li>
</ol>

<p>So I eBay'd the Ergodox, and used the money to buy a RealForce Topre keyboard. Weirdly, I bought a Japanese layout keyboard, which has some very slight advantages specific to my work that I'll explain shortly. I also ditched the Workman layout - it's nice, and I would recommend it, but most likely for those writing more prose than those programming. It flows well for words and becomes more awkward when using, say, <code>vim</code>, but it was particularly awkward in combination with the flaws of the Ergodox. Ultimately I dropped it because I realised my issues weren't down to QWERTY.</p>

<p>One aspect of the Ergodox which is nice is the ability to cant the keyboard over or away from you - I recommend doing this. If you raise a keyboard up, say with the feet usually attached at the back, you apply extra strain to the back of your hands to accommodate for the extra angle. Having a flatter keyboard is better in this regard.</p>

<h3>So this weird choice to use a Japanese layout keyboard huh?</h3>

<p><img title="RealForce Topre R2" alt="RealForce Topre R2" src="https://img.senryumedia.net/1ed11afe34645b232188eab4a32ce7d7.jpg"></p>

<p>So I bought a <a href="https://www.realforce.co.jp/products/R2TL-JPV-IV/">Japanese layout RealForce Topre R2 keyboard</a> with variably weighted springs. I love it, it's by far the best keyboard I've ever used. It was also hideously expensive, so if anyone from RealForce is out there and wants to supply me with keyboards to shill I am 100% <em>on-board</em>.</p>

<p>The Japanese layout both is and isn't odd. The extra keys for kana writing can be ignored, I just rebind them in <code>.Xmodmap</code> and use them for things like push-to-talk on Discord. The rest of the layout isn't too far from the UK ISO layout. Where it gets interesting is in the symbols.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double-quotes are above <code>2</code>, which I like as it splits them between the hands. I typically use <code>Right Shift</code>+<code>2</code> to type it</li>
<li>Single-quotes are above <code>7</code>, which is hella weird at first, but actually I now really like it. I use it 50/50 with left or right shift, always using both hands</li>
<li>Both semi-colon and colon are first-level keys. This is awesome for programming</li>
<li><code>@</code> is a first-level key. This is particularly nice for <em>Ruby</em></li>
<li>Underscore is a bit weird, and sits directly next to a shortened shift. This was the hardest key to get used to. I tend to move my right hand over and use two fingers to press the combination</li>
<li>Everything else is slightly shifted from the UK ISO layout but not weirdly so</li>
</ol>

<p>Because I like it so much now, I also have a Bluetooth Japanese-layout HHKB for a travel keyboard, which is very nice. I just stick it on top of any laptop I might have to use, to show who's in charge.</p>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>



<p>This was surprisingly easier to film than I expected. You'll have to forgive me the dusty desk, I currently don't have a carpet in my office so it's almost entirely pointless dusting as it's back to this state within 2 days.</p>

<p>I've noticed my left hand moves less than my right, but you can see that it often covers over to <code>Y</code> and I also move frequently to <code>7</code> for the single-quote on this keyboard. I rarely use my pinky fingers on either hand for letters. The right hand moves very freely across <code>Enter</code>, modifiers, punctuation, and …</p></section></article></section></div></div>

February 11, 2021 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2021/should-random-be-banned/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2021/should-random-be-banned/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Thought experiment: should the use of non-cryptographically secure <code>random()</code> be flagged to developers (examples: <a href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b311-random" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/securego/gosec/blob/a4746e18e3df52bfb21f59420d2c57cb12ef40ec/rules/rand.go#L44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gosec</a>)? Assume we find the function calls 100% accurately (all true positives, no false positives), and we prevent merging when it’s present.</p>
<p>Academics would say yes — the <code>random()</code> rule always detects what it promises and could be a vulnerability. But the practitioners amongst us are likely to hesitate — does it matter enough to stop engineers’ work? Isn’t <code>random()</code> often used for non-cryptographically sensitive operations?</p>
<p>Herein lies the disconnect between static analysis theory and practice: the world’s most accurate static analysis rule is valueless if developers don’t agree the result has impact, yet as an industry we use the rate of true vs. false positives as the measure of quality.</p>
<p>At r2c we wanted to know how static analysis rules for Semgrep perform in practice. So we set out to create a better metric for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-findings/#analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep App</a> users. We call it Fix Rate.</p>
<p>Fix Rate is the percentage of merge-blocking findings that are fixed (i.e., not muted*) in CI. We believe this is a proxy for engineering value. As we run our own developer-focused security programs, we’re obsessing over how to increase the Fix Rate for the rules on our projects.</p>

<p>Observing a bad 0% Fix Rate for <code>random()</code> (with only 7 data points from our projects), we decided to silence the rule for r2c developers but send a Slack notification to the security team using <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/managing-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-policy projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/#audit-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI audit mode</a>. Even in this first version, we’re finding Fix Rate incredibly powerful for evolving our own rules, policies, and development practices.</p>
<p>We shared Fix Rate with the Figma security team early on, which they used for rule development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With its GitHub integration, Semgrep brings security analysis to where development happens. Figmates get security feedback in their PRs, while rule analytics gives the security team feedback on the effectiveness of our rules and patterns. The simple grep like syntax allows us to extend Semgrep to catch new patterns, going from idea to live in an hour.</em></p>

<p><em>— Dev Akhawe, Head of Security, Figma</em></p>
<p>We’re excited for developer action to determine the efficacy of static analysis rules. For this you need to surface real findings to real engineers writing real code; no pre-existing benchmark will suffice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>What would happen if a &lt;iframe&gt; tag on a page pointed to the same page ? In HTML, iframes are elements designed to display documents under an URL, as if we would load it as we normally do in our browsers. See it as a small window within a web document which can display another web document. For instance, what you see here is an &lt;iframe&gt; pointing to the homepage of this website, <strong>https://ciphrd.com</strong>:</p>







<p><em>On a side note, the technique I am going to present is not really “feedback” per say, it’s more like a regular loop, but it reminds so much of a feedback effect that I found the name appropriate.</em> <strong>Source code at the end.</strong></p>



<h4>1. The most basic &lt;iframe&gt; loop</h4>



<p>Just as a quick reminder, this is how an iframe can be used:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;iframe src="https://ciphrd.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>



<p>The browser, when coming accros this tag, reads the <em>src</em> attribute and loads the web document under the URL into the area available for the iframe. Such area can be defined with <strong>CSS</strong> rules, or by setting a width and height attribute to the tag. For more informations, see the article about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp" target="_blank">html iframe on W3Schools</a> [1].</p>



<p>Now, the idea behind &lt;iframe&gt; feedback: let the src attribute point to the same location as the page in which the &lt;iframe&gt; is displayed. To experiment with such idea, I built a very simple html page and I hosted it on a local server at <strong>http://localhost:8080/</strong></p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;iframe loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;iframe&nbsp;src="http://localhost:8080"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>By loading http://localhost:8080/ in the browser, the document should be displayed and the &lt;iframe&gt; should display the same document, over and over. With some very simple rules we can define the size of our iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;500px;
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;320px;
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;20px;
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see how it is handled by chrome (88.0.4324.150):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="350" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>1. Our most basic example</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, that’s weird. It looks like the browser only loads the first &lt;iframe&gt; and then prevents an infinite loop from happening by removing the contents of the 2nd nested &lt;iframe&gt;. A quick inspection of the HTML tree will confirm our hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="734" height="459" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection.jpg 734w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tree-inspection-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px"><figcaption>2. Inspecting the HTML tree computed by Chrome</figcaption></figure>



<p>So, the hypothesis is verified. We cannot nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; tags because the browser prevents it, which is normal if we think about it. We wouldn’t want our computer to freeze if we were to load a webpage using such a trick.</p>



<h4>2. How to nest any number of &lt;iframe&gt;</h4>



<p>The issue here, is that the &lt;iframe&gt; tag is already present on the document loaded by the browser. Let’s see what happens if we insert the tag after the page has loaded, using javascript. Let’s reduce our HTML page to the following:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&gt;
&lt;html&nbsp;lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta&nbsp;name="viewport"&nbsp;content="width=device-width"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;Iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;iframe&nbsp;loop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>And let’s write some Javascript which will insert the tag as soon as the page is loaded:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
document.body.append(iframe)</code></pre>



<p>The following javascript code needs to be loaded in the page somehow, the &lt;script&gt; tag can be used in that matter. However, because I am using <strong>webpack</strong>, my javascript gets automatically added to the document. The project I created for you to experiment with iframe feedback has the same feature, I’ll explain in <strong>on the last part of this article</strong>. For now, just assume that the javascript is added to the page. Let’s see what happens now:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>3. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag programatically</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same issue remains. Maybe we can try with a delay ?</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;this&nbsp;code&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;executed&nbsp;1000ms&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;has&nbsp;loaded</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.href
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="922" height="557" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic.jpg 922w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-most-most-basic-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px"><figcaption>4. Inserting the &lt;iframe&gt; tag after a delay of 1sec</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, so it looks like we cannot just nest infinite &lt;iframe&gt; this way. Maybe we need to trick the browser into thinking that the page displayed is not the same. To do that, I configured my local server so that any path provided after the URL will point to the index.html. So, if I try to load <strong>http://localhost:8080/home</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/cucumber</strong>, <strong>http://localhost:8080/zeagjaga/ergjergeg/erg</strong>,… , the same index.html file will be loaded. We can now configure our script to set the <strong>src</strong> tag to the same domain plus a random string of characters:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;adds&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;string&nbsp;of&nbsp;7&nbsp;characters&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;domain</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;1000)</code></pre>



<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="558" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-its-looping-768x465.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>5. Iframes with a different URL pointing to the same page</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hehehe</strong>… It’s working. A quick inspection of the DOM can confirm this hypothesis:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="687" height="533" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM.jpg 687w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5-looping-DOM-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px"><figcaption>6. The DOM of our infinite nested iframes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wonderful ! So, to nest “<em>self-replicating</em>” &lt;iframe&gt; tags, the constraints are the following:</p>



<ul><li>the URL path must be different</li><li>a server must be configured so that different URL points to the same document</li></ul>



<p>That’s it. We don’t even need the delay before inserting the &lt;iframe&gt;. I will keep it though, I don’t really want the browser to crash because of that (not that it will, but if we want to do more fun stuff than just adding a new &lt;iframe&gt;, it might).</p>



<h4>3. Having fun</h4>



<p>Now that we found a way to load as many nested &lt;iframe&gt; as we want, let’s have some fun ! First, let’s change the size of an &lt;iframe&gt; so that its dimensions are relative to the viewport area it renders to:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
}

h1&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the&nbsp;title&nbsp;"float"&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;top&nbsp;left</em>
}</code></pre>



<p>Which will give us a way better result in terms of space occupation of the iframe elements:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="559" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size.jpg 921w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-300x182.jpg 300w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-better-size-768x466.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px"><figcaption>7. &lt;iframe&gt; dimensions are related to their parent dimensions</figcaption></figure>



<p>I guess you understand now why I called this technique <em>iframe feedback</em>. It just looks like it. However, <strong>this is by no mean true feedback</strong>.</p>



<p>We can remove the title and assign a random color to the background of the body to create a simple color effect:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;color&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;background,&nbsp;&nbsp;x|0&nbsp;removes&nbsp;the&nbsp;decimal&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;x</em>
document.body.style.backgroundColor&nbsp;=&nbsp;`rgba(${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;${(Math.random()*255)|0},&nbsp;1)`

setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;const&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;=&nbsp;document.createElement('iframe')
&nbsp;&nbsp;iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.body.append(iframe)
},&nbsp;200)</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-simple-colors.mp4"></video><figcaption>8. Setting a random color to the body of the document</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are familiar with writing web applications, you may see now how much fun we can have with this technique. Let’s try adding some <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank">CSS animations</a></strong> [2] to the position of the &lt;iframe&gt;:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">body&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow:&nbsp;hidden;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;hides&nbsp;the&nbsp;scrollbar&nbsp;if&nbsp;window&nbsp;gets&nbsp;too&nbsp;small</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;100vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;set&nbsp;the&nbsp;body&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;size&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;viewport</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;100vh;
}

<em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

iframe&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;width:&nbsp;90vw;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;width</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height:&nbsp;90vh;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;90%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;height</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position:&nbsp;absolute;
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;with&nbsp;receive&nbsp;animation&nbsp;move&nbsp;and&nbsp;loops&nbsp;by&nbsp;alternating&nbsp;directions</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animation:&nbsp;move&nbsp;1s&nbsp;ease-in-out&nbsp;0s&nbsp;infinite&nbsp;alternate-reverse;
}</code></pre>



<p>I’m not going into in-depth details about what this CSS animation does. But here is the result:</p>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-animatee-position.mp4"></video><figcaption>9. Animating the iframe position using CSS rules</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can add some rotation to the animation:</p>



<pre><code lang="css"><em>@keyframes</em>&nbsp;move&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(-20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:&nbsp;10vh;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:&nbsp;10vw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transform:&nbsp;rotate(20deg);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}</code></pre>



<figure><video controls="" muted="" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-adding-rotation.mp4"></video><figcaption>10. Adding rotation to the CSS animation</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty fun ! What’s great is that we can take fulfill of all the sweet features made available by our browsers to have fun with this technique. Some issues remain though:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;iframe&gt; tags are added indefinitely</li><li>each &lt;iframe&gt; is independent, we have no way to know its position in the tree</li></ul>



<p>Let’s solve those issues and create a basic starting point from which <strong>experimentation with this technique can safely be done </strong>!</p>



<h4>4. Improving the solution</h4>



<p>First of all, we can define an easy solution to prevent iframes from being inserted indefinitely. If the viewport size reaches 0, there is no need to insert an iframe because it won’t have any effect on the screen:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>try</em>&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;(window.innerWidth&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;window.innerHeight&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;1)&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>throw</em>&nbsp;new&nbsp;Error()&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;as&nbsp;usual</em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;...</em>
}
<em>catch</em>&nbsp;(error)&nbsp;{}&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>//&nbsp;exit</em></code></pre>



<p>The trick I am using here provides a way to <em>exit</em> the main script by using the try… catch mechanism. If we throw an error in the <strong>try</strong>{} block, what’s after will be skipped and the <strong>catch</strong>{} block will be triggered. If there were no catch block, the script would still stop but the error would be sent to the <strong>console as “Uncaught Error”</strong>. Yes, that’s what it is.</p>



<p>We now have a safe guard to prevent infinite looping in most cases. What we could need is to find a way to get the index of the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; <strong>nested nightmare</strong>. Remember, we currently use the following trick to call for a new iframe:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript">iframe.src&nbsp;=&nbsp;location.origin&nbsp;+&nbsp;'/'&nbsp;+&nbsp;Math.random().toFixed(7).replace('.',&nbsp;'')</code></pre>



<p>The <strong>location </strong>object [3] has different properties we can use to solve our problem. Let’s see what the <strong>location object</strong> is on the page <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em> :</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="565" height="286" src="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location.jpg 565w, https://ciphrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-location-300x152.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"><figcaption>11. The Location object on <em>https://ciphrd.com/category/laboratory/</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It seems like the <strong>origin </strong>property stores whats before the first <strong>/</strong> and the <strong>pathname</strong> stores what’s after the origin (https://ciphrd.com), including the first <strong>/</strong>. Let’s use those properties to keep track of the index of each frame:</p>



<pre><code lang="javascript"><em>//&nbsp;gets&nbsp;what's&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;/&nbsp;,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;url&nbsp;path</em>
<em>//&nbsp;or&nbsp;0&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;path&nbsp;is&nbsp;empty&nbsp;(so&nbsp;t…</em></code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="document"><div><div><div><article><p><em>tl;dr—Despite an exponential increase in computing power, our applications
require more machines than ever because of architectural decisions made 25 years
ago. You can eliminate much of your complexity and cost by using SQLite &amp;
Litestream for your production applications.</em></p><h2 id="when-i-was-your-age">When I was your age…</h2><p>I can tell I’m getting old because I talk about the “good old days” of computing.
Back when knowing a single programming language and SQL was good enough to work
at most jobs. Back when you could build all your web pages with basic HTML skills.</p><p>But the good old days weren’t actually that good.</p><p>They kinda sucked.</p><p>In 1995, the <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/10/01/lamp-stack-php-mysql-apache-history/">LAMP stack</a> emerged. It was a combination of Linux, Apache,
MySQL, &amp; PHP. It’s a simple stack that all lived on one box. Unfortunately, that
box was stocked with a CPU that was measured in megahertz and memory that was
measured in megabytes. It was dog slow.</p><p>But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> promised a better future as computers became
exponentially faster. So why do we need more computers than ever before?</p><h3 id="where-it-went-wrong">Where it went wrong</h3><p>Since early web languages like PHP and Ruby were slow, you didn’t want them
running on your database server so you moved them to their own servers in what
is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">n-tier architecture</a>. Now you can keep adding more
stateless Ruby servers to this <em>presentation layer</em> and scale your application.</p><p>Database servers like Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL tended to be complicated to
operate so this architecture helped to isolate them. Scaling and managing
a fleet of database servers is a nighmare so organizations scale up their
database machine vertically as much as possible before they scaled horizontally
to multiple servers.</p><p>This n-tier architecture sounds simple at first but it has hidden complexity. On
a single machine, our server could add an in-memory cache to speed up requests
but now data is shared across multiple machines so we must add a <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a>
or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> server to share cached data. Database servers are easily overloaded
by numerous connections so we have to add intermediate services like
<a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">PgBouncer</a> to pool connections. If we have events in our system that must be
communicated to all our nodes then we need a cluster of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> machines.</p><p>Now we have a fleet of machines to manage. These systems have then caused an
explosion in infrastructure automation with tooling like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. All of
these layers slow us down from our job of writing software systems that solve
real problems.</p><p>What started as a simple two-tier software system has grown into a behemoth with
a dozen layers of complexity.</p><p>Complexity begets complexity.</p><h2 id="building-litestream">Building Litestream</h2><p>My background is in writing databases. Seven years ago, I wrote a pure Go,
embedded key/value store called <a href="http://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a> that has seen success in other
open-source applications that use it such as <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>.</p><p>For a while, I used Bolt when writing applications and it was refreshing because
there were no depedencies to set up and performance was <em>blazingly fast</em>.
However, it lacked features like schema migration, a query language, or a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> so it made application development difficult. But instead of going back
to database servers like Postgres, I turned to <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p><h3 id="moving-to-sqlite">Moving to SQLite</h3><p><em>“But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?"</em></p><p>No, there’s a growing movement of people that see the value of single process
applications. Expensify has run tests of <a href="https://blog.expensify.com/2018/01/08/scaling-sqlite-to-4m-qps-on-a-single-server/">4 million queries per second on a
single node</a> using SQLite. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcrawshaw">David Crawshaw</a> has a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqubKSF3wig">conference talk</a> and <a href="https://crawshaw.io/blog/one-process-programming-notes">blog post</a> on building
single process applications on SQLite. Django co-creator <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon
Willison</a> built a data exploration and publishing tool called
<a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> that’s built on SQLite.</p><p>SQLite is known for being bulletproof and having an <a href="https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/sqlite-testing">absurdly in-depth testing
suite</a>. It’s motto is <em>“Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three."</em></p><p>So why is SQLite considered a “toy” database in the application development
world and not a production database?</p><h3 id="that-one-big-issue">That one big issue</h3><p>The biggest problem with using SQLite in production is disaster recovery. If
your server dies, so does your data. That’s… not good.</p><p>Other database servers have replication so they can stream database changes to
another server in case one goes down. The best you can hope for with standard
SQLite is to run a nightly backup. Solutions like <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a> are great but
it requires a 3-node cluster.</p><p>Why can’t SQLite have a replication tool that’s as easy to use as SQLite?</p><h3 id="the-problem-litestream-solves">The problem Litestream solves</h3><p>I built Litestream to bring back sanity to application development. Litestream
is a tool that runs in a separate process and continuously replicates a SQLite
database to Amazon S3. You can get up and running with a few
lines of configuration. Then you can set-it-and-forget-it and get back to
writing code.</p><p>You might think this sounds expensive to continuously write to cloud storage
that provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.99% uptime</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">99.999999999% durability</a> but
it’s astoundingly cheap. Typical costs are only about $1 per month. Litestream
is free and open-source too so there’s never a license to pay for.</p><h3 id="but-i-need-100-uptime">But I need 100% uptime…</h3><p>The software industry has chased uptime as a goal in and of itself over the last
several decades. Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime
deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability
issues. <a href="https://k8s.af/">There’s even a web site dedicated to public postmortems related to
Kubernetes.</a></p><p>Most cloud providers provide multiple layers of redundancy in their systems to
protect against individual node and network failures. This doesn’t provide a
100% guarantee but will provide you with very high uptime servers. Anecdotally,
I’ve run several VPS servers over the years which all have well over 99.9%
uptime and have suffered no catastrophic failures.</p><h3 id="sounds-good-but-how-do-you-scale-this">Sounds good, but how do you scale this?</h3><p>Developers always want to know how to scale but that depends on their particular
application. Typically, you want to scale vertically first by simply increasing
amount of CPUs cores and RAM on your machine first.</p><p>Servers these days have a <em>ton</em> of power. I recently wrote a Go web application
with a SQLite database that would serve an HTTP request with multiple database
queries in under <em>50µs</em> on a $5/month VPS. That translates to thousands of
requests per second per core. SQLite scales reads well with the number of cores
on a machine. Amazon AWS has machines that can then scale up to 96 CPU cores and
hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.</p><p>If you exceed the capacity of a single node, sharding your data can allow you to
scale horizontally to multiple nodes. This works particularly well for SaaS
applications where each customer is isolated from one another. Because SQLite
and Litestream simplify deployment, managing a cluster of several isolated nodes
is easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-litestream">The Future of Litestream</h2><p>Litestream is helping to simplify application development but that’s only the
start of it. There are exciting features coming including replication to
<a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/8">read-only replicas</a>. This will give you the ability to run local
copies of your database at the edge to deliver requests instantly.</p><p>If you’re interested in trying out Litestream, the <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started">Getting
Started</a> can get you up and running in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>I’m interested to hear from others that want to simplify and improve application
development. If you have ideas or thoughts about the future of Litestream,
please get in touch on the <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions">GitHub Discussions board</a> and drop me a

  Cosmopolitan lets you build executables that run natively on seven
  operating systems. One of the first questions C/C++ developers ask is
  how much bloat does that entail? Is the Cosmopolitan Runtime lean and
  mean like Go's 2mb Hello World executables? Or is it a monster like
  Electron or those hundred megabyte OpenJDK shell scripts.

</p><p>
  The answer is it takes about 12kb. That's how big a statically-linked
  executable needs to be to run natively without dependencies on Linux,
  Mac, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and BIOS. Cosmopolitan is
  designed to let you build such programs. This page will demonstrate
  why the portability benefits Cosmopolitan provides have negligible
  performance impact and therefore only serve to save time while
  ensuring your work can reach a broader audience.

</p><p>
  The form below lets you build and visualize hello world programs with
  a customized support vector. It will show you exactly what goes into
  an <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html" title="Actually Portable Executable">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> that lets it integrate with so many systems.
  Since seeing is believing, the hope is that you'll choose to trust
  Cosmopolitan as your POSIX-comforming systems abstraction.

    <p>Technology is merely a tool. It can work for us or against us. If we use it with agency, we can leverage the world’s information to better our lives. If we use it indiscriminately, we find ourselves at the mercy of the Algorithm, passively consuming content. Our generation is at an inflection point - either we use technology intentionally or it uses us.</p>

<p>This post is about one principle that transformed my relationship with technology: feeds considered harmful. Feeds slow you down, take you in unwanted directions and encourage consumption over action. Adopting the principle enabled me to effectively focus, prioritize and act on my goals.</p>

<p>A feed is a set of algorithmically generated content provided to the user without explicit input. Almost all of our interactions with services begin with a feed - Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, News. You name the app, it has a feed front and center. (Although this definition doesn’t include messaging apps or RSS feeds, some of the concerns below still hold.)</p>

<p>Feeds distract and slow you down. Ever catch yourself binging on The Office clips an hour after you open YouTube to learn how to revive your dying succulent? This is no accident - it’s the digital equivalent of placing the milk in the back of the grocery store. Even if you have a clear purpose for navigating to a site, it hijacks your attention with content the Algorithm has concluded you can’t resist. Instant gratification is only a click away.</p>

<p>If you’re mindlessly browsing, the effect of feeds is even more potent. The brief dopamine hit triggered by fresh content quickly evolves into analysis paralysis. Ever spend a half hour on Netflix just deciding what to watch? Then, shortly after a decision is made, feel a pang of buyer’s remorse? The abundance of options challenges the optimality of your choice, and in the face of the slightest obstacle, lures you to a replacement. Greener pastures are only a click away. And so begins the endless cycle of novelty and disillusion. The only way out is through - establishing an intent and following through.</p>

<p>You may be asking: don’t feeds broaden our exposure to new ideas? Yes, they do. But there’s no free lunch. Time spent consuming is time not spent doing. Taking meaningful action requires a delicate balance of explore and exploit. Feeds uproot this balance, disproportionately encouraging discovery instead of focused execution. This is best explained with a navigation analogy - explore is direction, exploit is movement. Explore is necessary in small doses, to make sure we’re moving in the right direction. Too much explore though, and we’ve over calibrated to our orientation - we’re no closer to our goal, but left with the illusion of progress (<em>cough</em> productivity porn <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>You can still explore without feeds. New ideas surface everywhere. In everyday conversations, which are inherently tailored to mutual interests. From resources in the exploit phase, as a springboard into complementary subjects. By browsing the library, a physical feed optimized for education instead of engagement. Instead of preventing exploration altogether, eliminating feeds recalibrates our explore-exploit balance by compelling us to adopt healthier forms of discovery that inevitably leave more energy for execution.</p>

<p>Speaking of execution, here’s how to reduce your dependence on feeds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify your triggers</strong>: What feeds consume your attention the most? As a proxy, check your most visited sites on desktop (yes, that is a feed too!) or most used apps on mobile (Screen Time for iOS, Digital Wellbeing for Android).</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate the feed.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>(Ideal) Remove the feed entirely. The ideal page is blank, save for a search bar - intentional begins with intent! Such Chrome extensions exist for the most popular services: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, etc.</li>
      <li>(Backup) If the above isn’t entirely possible (say because you’re an active mobile user), add friction. A very effective solution is to uninstall the app and only access the service through the browser. Your muscle memory in the first few days will be a great reminder of how unconsciously you used these feeds, but it won’t take long to unlearn.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Repeat for the new triggers that emerge.</strong> As your usual suspects are solved for, you will reach for new distractions. It will take a few cycles to fully eliminate them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects may include mild FOMO (which will soon subside), an enhanced feeling of control and excessive amounts of spare time to live life on your terms, not the Algorithm’s.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As part of our standard toolkit, we provide each developer at Skroutz
with a writable database snapshot against which she can develop. These
snapshots are updated daily through a pipeline that involves taking an
LVM snapshot of production data, anonymizing the dataset by stripping
all personal data, and transferring it via rsync to the development
database servers. The development servers in turn use ZFS snapshots to
expose a copy-on-write snapshot to each developer, with
self-service tools allowing rollback or upgrades to newer snapshots.</p>

<p>We use the same pipeline to expose MariaDB and MongoDB data, with a
full dataset size of 600GB and 200GB respectively, and a slightly
modified pipeline for Elasticsearch. While on-disk data changes
significantly for all data sources, rsync still saves significant time
by transferring roughly 1/3 of the full data set every night. This
setup has worked rather well for the better part of a decade and has
managed to scale from 15 developers to 150. However, as with most
systems, it has had its fair share of maintenance and has given us
some interesting moments.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting issues we encountered led to the discovery
of a fairly old bug in the Linux kernel TCP implementation: every now
and then, an rsync transfer from a source server would hang
indefinitely for no apparent reason, as — apart from the stuck transfer —
everything else seemed to be in order. What’s more, for reasons that became
apparent later, the issue could not be reproduced at will, although
some actions (e.g. adding an rsync-level rate limit) seemed to make
the issue less frequent, with frequency ranging from once or twice per
week to once every three months.</p>

<p>As is not unusual in these cases, we had more urgent systems and issues to
attend to, so we labeled this a “race condition in rsync” that we
should definitely look into at some point, and worked around it by
throttling the rsync transfers.</p>

<p>Until it started biting us every single day.</p>

<h2 id="rsync-as-a-pipeline">rsync as a pipeline</h2>

<p>While not strictly necessary, knowing how rsync works internally will help
understand the analysis that follows. The rsync site contains <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html">a thorough
description</a> of rsync’s internal architecture, so I’ll try to
summarize the most important points here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>rsync starts off as a single process on the client and a single
process on the server, communicating via a socket pair. When using
the rsync daemon, as in our case, communication is done over a
plain TCP connection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the direction of sync, after the initial handshake is
over, each end assumes a <em>role</em>, either that of the <em>sender</em>, or
that of the <em>receiver</em>. In our case the client is the receiver,
and the server is the sender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The receiver forks an additional process called the <em>generator</em>,
sharing the socket with the <em>receiver</em> process. The <em>generator</em>
figures out what it needs to ask from the <em>sender</em>, and the
<em>sender</em> subsequently sends the data to the <em>receiver</em>. What we
essentially have after this step is a pipeline, <em>generator</em> →
<em>sender</em> → <em>receiver</em>, where the arrows are the two directions of
<em>the same</em> TCP connection. While there is some signaling involved,
the pipeline operates in a <em>blocking</em> fashion and relies on OS
buffers and TCP receive windows to apply backpressure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-ghost-in-the-network">A ghost in the network?</h2>

<p>Our first reaction when we encountered the issue was to suspect the
network for errors, which was a <em>reasonable</em> thing to do since we had
recently upgraded our servers and switches. After eliminating the
usual suspects (NIC firmware bugs involving TSO/GSO/GRO/VLAN
offloading, excessive packet drops or CRC errors at the switches etc),
we came to the conclusion that everything was normal and something
else had to be going on.</p>

<p>Attaching the hung processes using strace and gdb told us little: the
generator was hung on <code>send()</code> and the sender and receiver were hung
on <code>recv()</code>, yet no data was moving. However, turning to the kernel on
both systems revealed something interesting! On the client the rsync
socket shared between the <em>generator</em> and the <em>receiver</em> processes was
in the following state:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito dst :873

<p>while on the server, the socket state was the following:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ss -mito src :873
State      Recv-Q Send-Q                Local Address:Port                                 Peer Address:Port

<p>The interesting thing here is that there are 3.5MB of data on the
client, queued to be sent (❶ in the first output) by the
<em>generator</em> to the server; however, while the server has an empty <code>Recv-Q</code>
and can accept data, nothing seems to be moving forward. If <code>Recv-Q</code>
in the second output was non-zero, we would be looking at rsync on the
server being stuck and not reading from the network, however here it
is obvious that rsync has consumed all incoming data and is not to
blame.</p>

<p>So why is data queued up on one end of the connection, while the other end is
obviously able to accept it? The answer is conveniently hidden in the <code>timer</code>
fields of both <code>ss</code> outputs, especially in
<code>timer:(persist,1min56sec,0)</code>. Quoting <code>ss(8)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="man">-o, --options
              Show timer information. For TCP protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(&lt;timer_name&gt;,&lt;expire_time&gt;,&lt;retrans&gt;)

              &lt;timer_name&gt;
                     the name of the timer, there are five kind of timer names:

                     on : means one of these  timers:  TCP  retrans  timer,  TCP
                     early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers</code></pre></div>

<p><code>persist</code> means that the connection has received a zero window
advertisement and is waiting for the peer to advertise a non-zero
window.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-zero-windows-and-zero-window-probes">TCP Zero Windows and Zero Window Probes</h2>

<p>TCP implements flow control by limiting the data in flight using a sliding
window called the <em>receive window</em>. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Flow_control">good description</a>, but in short each end of a TCP connection advertises how much
data it is willing to buffer for the connection, i.e. how much data the other
end may send before waiting for an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When one side’s receive buffer (<code>Recv-Q</code>) fills up (in this case
because the rsync process is doing disk I/O at a speed slower than the
network’s), it will send out a zero window advertisement, which will
put that direction of the connection on hold. When buffer space
eventually frees up, the kernel will send an unsolicited window update
with a non-zero window size, and the data transfer continues. To be
safe, just in case this unsolicited window update is lost, the other
end will regularly poll the connection state using the so-called Zero
Window Probes (the <code>persist</code> mode we are seeing here).</p>

<h2 id="the-window-is-stuck-closed">The window is stuck closed</h2>

<p>It’s now time to dive a couple of layers deeper and use <code>tcpdump</code> to
see what’s going on at the network level:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="text">[…]

[… repeats every 2 mins]</code></pre></div>

<p>The first packet is the rsync client’s zero window probe, the second
packet is the server’s response. Surprisingly enough, the server is
advertising a non-zero window size of 13831 bytes¹ which the client
apparently ignores.</p>

<p>¹ actually multiplied by 128 because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_window_scale_option">window scaling</a> factor
of 7</p>

<p>We are finally making some progress and have a case to work on! At
some point the client encountered a zero window advertisement from the
server as part of regular TCP flow control, but then the window failed
to re-open for some reason. The client seems to be still ignoring
the new window advertised by the server and this is why the transfer
is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="linux-tcp-input-processing">Linux TCP input processing</h2>

<p>By now it’s obvious that the TCP connection is in a weird state on the
rsync client. Since TCP flow control happens at the kernel level, to
get to the root of this we need to look at how the Linux kernel
handles incoming TCP acknowledgments and try to figure out why it
ignores the incoming window advertisement.</p>

<p>Incoming TCP packet processing happens in

<p>Let me say up front, I’m <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/09/a-word-on-anti-furry-sentiments-in-the-tech-community/">no stranger to negative or ridiculous feedback</a>. It’s incredibly hard to hurt my feelings, especially if you intend to. You don’t openly participate in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/23/never-underestimate-the-furry-fandom/">the furry fandom</a> since 2010 without being accustomed to malevolence and trolling. If this were simply a story of someone being an asshole to me, I would have shrugged and moved on with my life.</p>



<p>It’s important that you understand this, because when you call it like you see it, sometimes people dismiss your criticism with <a href="https://www.takethis.org/2016/04/triggered-a-personal-response-to-a-popular-meme/">“triggered” memes</a>. This isn’t me being offended. I promise.</p>

<p>My recent blog post about <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/">crackpot cryptography</a> received a fair bit of attention in the software community. At one point it was on the front page of Hacker News (which is something that pretty much never happens for anything I write).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that also means I crossed paths with Zed A. Shaw, the author of <em>Learn Python the Hard Way</em> and other books often recommended to neophyte software developers.</p>



<p>As someone who spends a lot of time <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/08/furward-momentum-introduction/">trying to help newcomers acclimate to the technology industry</a>, there are some behaviors I’ve recognized in technologists over the years that makes it harder for newcomers to overcome anxiety, frustration, and Impostor Syndrome. (Especially if they’re LGBTQIA+, a person of color, or a woman.)</p>



<p>Normally, these are easily correctable behaviors exhibited by people who have good intentions but don’t realize the harm they’re causing–often not by what they’re saying, but by how they say it.</p>



<p>Sadly, I can’t be so generous about… whatever <em>this</em> is:</p>

</div><figcaption>What the fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Having never before encountered a living example of a poorly-written villain towards the work I do to help disadvantaged people thrive in technology careers, I sought to clarify Shaw’s intent.</p>

<p>This is effectively a very <em>weird</em> hybrid of an oddly-specific purity test and a form of hazing ritual.</p>



<p>Let’s step back for a second. Can you even fathom the damage attitudes like this can cause? I can tell you firsthand, because it happened to me.</p>



<h2 id="interlude">Interlude: Amplified Impostor Syndrome</h2>



<p>In the beginning of my career, I was just a humble web programmer. Due to a long story I don’t want to get into now, I was acquainted with the culture of black-hat hacking that precipitates the DEF CON community.</p>



<p>In particular, I was exposed the writings of a malicious group called <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/ZF0/">Zero For 0wned</a>, which made sport of hunting “skiddiez” and preached a very “shut up and stay in your lane” attitude:</p>



<blockquote><p>Geeks don’t really come to HOPE to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means, by a 15 year old. A combination of all the above could be why your room wasn’t full. Not only was it fairly empty, but it emptied at a rapid rate. I could barely take a seat through the masses pushing me to escape. Then when I thought no more people could possibly leave, they kept going. The room was almost empty when I gave in and left also. Heck, I was only there because we pwned the very resources you were talking about.</p><cite>Zero For 0wned</cite></blockquote>



<p>My first security conference was B-Sides Orlando in 2013. Before the conference, I had been hanging out in the #hackucf IRC channel and had known about the event well in advance (and got along with all the organizers and most of the would-be attendees), and considered applying to their CFP.</p>



<p>I ultimately didn’t, solely because I was worried about a ZF0-style reception. </p>



<p>I had no reference frame for other folks’ understanding of cryptography (which is my chosen area of discipline in infosec), and thought things like timing side-channels were “obvious”–even to software developers outside infosec. (Such is the danger of being self-taught!)</p>



<p>“Geeks don’t really come to B-Sides Orlando to be lectured on the application of something simple, with very simple means,” is roughly how I imagined the vitriol would be framed.</p>



<p>If it can happen to me, it can happen to <em>anyone</em> interested in tech. It’s the responsibility of experts and mentors to spare beginners from falling into the trappings of other peoples’ grand-standing.</p>



<h2 id="arrogance">Pride Before Destruction</h2>



<p>With this in mind, let’s return to Shaw. At this point, more clarifying questions came in, this time from Fredrick Brennan.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OpenSSL had way more problems than only memory safety, but since you don't know about the various downgrade and SSL/TLS protocol issues you just outed yourself as knowing less about cryptography than me.</p><p>And, my whole point is you're no expert because you didn't see them.</p></div>— Zed A. Shaw, Writer (@lzsthw) <a href="https://twitter.com/lzsthw/status/1359712275666505734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>What an arrogant and bombastic thing to say!</p>



<p>At this point, I concluded that <a href="https://twitter.com/SoatokDhole/status/1359703488998105090">I can never again, in good conscience, recommend any of Shaw’s books to a fledgling programmer</a>.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever published book recommendations before, I suggest auditing them to make sure you’re not inadvertently exposing beginners to his harmful attitude and problematic behavior.</p>



<p>But while we’re on the subject of Zed Shaw’s behavior…</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>This is actually the dude’s pinned tweet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Shaw thinks of himself as a superior cryptography expert, surely he’s published cryptography code online before.</p>



<p>And surely, it will withstand a five-minute code review from a gay furry blogger who never went through Shaw’s prescribed hazing ritual to rediscover specifically the known problems in OpenSSL circa Heartbleed and is therefore not as much of a cryptography expert?</p>







<h2 id="zero-day">May I Offer You a Zero-Day in This Trying Time?</h2>



<p>One of Zed A. Shaw’s Github projects is <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin">an implementation of SRP</a> (Secure Remote Password)–an early Password-Authenticated Key Exchange algorithm often integrated with TLS (to form TLS-SRP).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2758" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/11/on-the-toxicity-of-zed-a-shaw/srpmin/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png" data-orig-size="693,463" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="srpmin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=693" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png 693w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/srpmin.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"><figcaption>Zed Shaw’s SRP implementation</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Without even looking past the directory structure, we can already see that it implements <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/master/t_truerand.c">an algorithm called TrueRand</a>, which cryptographer Matt Blaze has this to say:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/tqbf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tqbf</a> Also: please nobody use truerand.

</div><figcaption>You should be <a href="https://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/">using /dev/urandom</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As noted by the README, Shaw stripped out all of the “extraneous” things and doesn’t have all of the previous versions of SRP “since those are known to be vulnerable”.</p>



<p>So given Shaw’s previous behavior, and the removal of vulnerable versions of SRP from his fork of Tom Wu’s libsrp code, it stands to reason that Shaw believes the cryptography code he published would be secure. Otherwise, why would he behave with such arrogance?</p>



<h3>SRP in the Grass</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2723" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/2021/02/09/crackpot-cryptography-and-security-theater/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png" data-orig-size="1200,960" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Soatok-by-ScruffKerfluff-Smol" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/soatok-by-scruffkerfluff-smol-1.png" alt=""><figcaption><strong>Head’s up!</strong> If you aren’t cryptographically or mathematically inclined, this section might be a bit dense for your tastes. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/ScruffKerfluff/">Scruff</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When I say SRP, I’m referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP-6a</a>. Earlier versions of the protocol are out of scope; as are proposed variants (e.g. ones that employ SHA-256 instead of SHA-1).</p>



<p>Professor Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University (who incidentally used to proverbially shit on OpenSSL in the way that Shaw expects everyone to, except productively) <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">dislikes SRP but considered the protocol “not obviously broken”</a>.</p>



<p>However, a secure protocol doesn’t mean the implementations are always secure. (Anyone who’s looked at older versions of OpenSSL’s BigNum library after reading my <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/">guide to side-channel attacks</a> knows better.)</p>



<p>There are a few ways to implement SRP insecurely:</p>



<ol><li>Use an insecure random number generator (e.g. TrueRand) for salts or private keys.</li><li>Fail to use a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#appendix-A">secure set of parameters</a> (q, N, g).<p>To expand on this, SRP requires q be a Sophie-Germain prime and N be its corresponding Safe Prime. The standard Diffie-Hellman primes (MODP) are not sufficient for SRP.</p><p>This security requirement exists because SRP requires an algebraic structure called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">ring</a>, rather than a cyclic group (as per Diffie-Hellman).</p></li><li>Fail to perform the critical validation steps <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-3.1">as outlined in RFC 5054</a>.</li></ol>



<p>In one way or another, Shaw’s SRP library fails at every step of the way. The first two are trivial:</p>



<ol><li>We’ve already seen the RNG used by srpmin. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/paper-prngs.pdf">TrueRand is not a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator</a>.</li><li>Zed A. Shaw’s srpmin <a href="https://github.com/zedshaw/srpmin/blob/217ec0a968a551fe6452c9bef7b37b38e165c94f/t_conf.c#L39-L107">only supports unsafe primes</a> for SRP (i.e. the ones from RFC 3526, which is for Diffie-Hellman).</li></ol>



<p>The third is more interesting. Let’s talk about the RFC 5054 validation steps in more detail.</p>



<h4 id="srp6a-validation">Parameter Validation in SRP-6a</h4>



<p>From a client’s perspective, you must verify that <code>(B % N) != 0</code>. This is critical to the security of SRP. This check <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00043000000000000000">prevents dictionary attacks on the password from a man-in-the-middle</a>.</p>



<p>From the server’s (or a peer’s) perspective, you must also verify <code>(A % N) &gt; 0</code> to prevent the server’s session key from being forced to a known value (i.e. zero).</p>



<p>Additionally, the value <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/ndss.html#SECTION00032400000000000000"><code>u</code> must not be revealed by the server until the client has sent <code>A</code></a>. It must also not be set to <code>0</code>. Failure to uphold these constraints can allow clients to impersonate their peers.</p>



<p>These are obvious and well-known SRP constraints first published in 1997 by Tom Wu.</p>

Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too.

All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke in 24.0 m³ chamber, Siegel and his team <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers</a> — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products.

The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms.

"Not everyone needs an enormous CADR, has huge rooms or incredibly dirty air."</p>  <p>Several experts told <em>Marketplace</em> the CADR is the most important metric and an internationally recognized benchmark.</p>  <p>"CADR is what you want to know, period," said Francis (Bud) Offermann, an indoor air quality researcher who has helped develop test methods for the performance of portable air cleaners with the American Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"An air cleaner with a very high-efficient filter and very little air-flow rate will have a low CADR and little air-cleaning ability; same for an air cleaner with a very high air-flow rate and a very low filter efficiency."&nbsp;</p>  <p>In terms of price and performance, the Honeywell True HEPA Whole Room Air Purifier with Allergen Remover HPA160 performed in the middle range of our pack, averaging a CADR of about 180 m3/hr. <em>Marketplace</em> found this product retailing for around $200.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Honeywell <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">said its air purifiers are AHAM certified</a> and compliant with AHAM standards, and are independently validated through repeatable, peer-reviewed tests.</p>  <h2>Expert says some UVC light claims are 'rubbish'</h2>  <p>One of the key promises from GermGuardian is that its AC5350B 28" Air Purifier with HEPA, UVC &amp; Digital purifier is equipped with a UV-C light that can "kill germs." <em>Marketplace</em> paid around $200 for this model.</p>  <p>While some professional-grade UV lights can do that, the experts Marketplace interviewed said the small dose of UV light GermGuardian's purifier delivers is not doing much of anything.</p>  <p>James Malley, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire and an expert on UV light, said that while UV-C light has been used for over 100 years to disinfect and kill viruses, the product must be properly designed and operated, and must use strong, directed UV-C light.</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH | Cleaning your indoor air on a budget:</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="How to clean the air in your home without spending hundreds of dollars" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1859106371942-metadata-" title="How to clean the air in your home without spending hundreds of dollars"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/438/1023/Air_quality_16x9_thumbnail.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An indoor air scientist explains what you can do to keep your home’s air clean without buying a purifier.<!-- --> <!-- -->4:00</span></span></span></p>  <p>Although there are some good UV-C products, Malley warned there are some companies making "rubbish" claims about the efficacy of their UV-C lights.&nbsp;</p>  <p>After analyzing the UV dose and the UV-C power of the GermGuardian, Malley said he feels confident that the UV dose would not be enough to significantly reduce airborne pathogens.</p>  <p>GermGuardian did not give a clear response to our questions about its UV light, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">but said its purifier</a> "eliminates over 99 per cent of airborne germs in a two-hour time frame," and all their purifiers are independently tested and AHAM verified for CADR.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/how-clean-is-the-air-in-your-home-1.5900697">Read the full statements from each company featured in our story here</a></li>  </ul>  <p>If you happen to already have any of these devices, Siegel said you don't need to toss them out.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We’re announcing <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base"><code>linear-base</code></a>,
a standard library for <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">Linear Haskell</a> programs.
Our release accompanies the release of <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/status/ghc-9.0.1">GHC
9.0</a> which supports <code>-XLinearTypes</code>. Linear base has been
written by Bhavik Mehta, a former Tweag intern, Arnaud Spiwack, and ourselves.</p>
<p>In the spirit of a standard library, <code>linear-base</code> is not a strict replica of
<code>base</code> with linearly-typed variants of all the facilities in <code>base</code>. Instead,
<code>linear-base</code> focuses on the abstractions one naturally <em>needs</em> and <em>desires</em>
when programming with linear types.</p>
<p>It does include some linear variants from <code>base</code>, but the library
ranges from mutable data structures with a pure API to a resource-safe I/O
monad, to linear-streams. It’s a “base” library, a helpful
prelude to programming using <code>-XLinearTypes</code>.</p>
<p>Of course this raises the question, what does a linear Haskell program look like?
And, how does <code>linear-base</code> provide what we <em>need</em> and what we <em>want</em> to write one?</p>
<h2>Envisioning Linear Haskell Programs</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <code>-XLinearTypes</code>, you can learn more by
browsing our
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base#learning-about--xlineartypes">README</a>.
At a bare-bones level, linear types simply
provide some further properties that a function declared with a signature like <code>f :: A %1-&gt; B</code> must satisfy. Namely, to type-check the body of <code>f</code>,
the <code>A</code> must be consumed exactly once. We are then able to leverage this
type-checking power to write functions that would have been unsafe to write
before (e.g., a pure interface to mutable data structures) or provide
alternative APIs to existing ones that place an obligation on the programmer to
ensure they avoid certain errors (such as reading from a closed file handle).
For more information about how <code>-XLinearTypes</code> works see our <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/tags/linear-types/">earlier
posts</a>.</p>
<p>There are two main families of motivations for this additional type-checking discussed
in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756">Linear Haskell paper</a>. First, we can write pure
APIs for mutable data structures such as arrays. As discussed in the paper,
this approach is sometimes more convenient to work with than using the
<code>ST</code> monad, and even makes <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.4.0/docs/Data-Array-Unsafe.html#v:unsafeFreeze"><code>unsafeFreeze</code></a> safe.</p>
<p>Second, <code>-XLinearTypes</code> enables us to type-check usage protocols.
An example discussed in the paper is the protocol of file handles, namely, that
file handles must be closed and then cannot be written to or read from<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, a typical linear program would likely be one that</p>
<ul>
<li>is mostly pure, but has a piece of state to use throughout. Using
linear types avoids that an <code>ST</code> monad invades
the larger, pure, part of the program</li>
<li>is resource-heavy and requires a non-trivial amount of reasoning on the part
of the programmer to ensure resource protocols are upheld.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we can envision a standard library as one that has the
<strong>linear gadgets we <em>want</em></strong>, like pure-interfaced mutable data structures and
resource-safe APIs, and the <strong>utilities we <em>need</em></strong>, like a linear <code>($)</code>, to
write a typical linear program.</p>
<h2>What we want: linear abstractions or use-cases!</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> comes equipped with a pure API for mutable <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Mutable/Linear.hs">arrays</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Vector/Mutable/Linear.hs">vectors</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/HashMap/Linear.hs">hashmaps</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Set/Mutable/Linear.hs">sets</a>.
These enable us to write a mutable implementation of

<p>This code reads rather like an imperative
program, where <code>arr</code> is updated through <code>arr</code>, <code>arr1</code>, <code>arr2</code> and so on.
Compared to using the <code>ST</code> monad, we lose the ability to share the
effect of mutations, in exchange we gain a pure interface, which can
be less invasive.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>linear-base</code> has a resource-safe <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/System/IO/Resource.hs">File I/O API</a> that ensures that file
handles, for instance, are closed and then no longer used.</li>
<li><code>linear-base</code> includes a <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/src/Streaming">linear variant</a> of the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming">streaming</a> library, which is compatible with the
resource-safe I/O monad, to ensure that resources accessed in the
monadic layers of streams have their protocols obeyed and that the protocols
of streams themselves are enforced. If the effects in streams can be repeated
more than once, we could, say, repeat the effect of reading from a file handle
after that handle is closed. Hence, we use control monads inside linear streams
to ensure monadic effects are performed exactly once. This is based
on
<a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2018-06-21-linear-streams/">the work</a> of Edvard Hübinette, for the Haskell Summer
of Code of 2018.</li>
<li>In order to define such resource-safe protocols, <code>linear-base</code> provides
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Monad/Linear.hs">control monads</a> and related monadic functions like <code>foldM</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we need: linear utilities!</h2>
<p>Of course, <code>linear-base</code> includes various abstractions that many
linear programs will end up using, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Variants of <code>base</code> abstractions like a linear <code>Num</code>, linear <code>Functor</code>s (in <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-01-16-data-vs-control/">two
flavors</a>), a linear <code>Data.List</code> API, and linear versions of
standard <code>Prelude</code> functions like <code>($)</code>.</p>
<p>We need these because functions as simple as</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>will only type-check if <code>(*)</code> and <code>(+)</code> have linear arrows. Similarly, using
standard abstractions from <code>base</code>, like functors, <code>($)</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>foldl</code>, will
not work inside many functions that have linear arguments.</p>
<p>As a special note, we use a linear <code>(&amp;)</code> for a workaround to the
current limitation that all case statements consume the scrutinee (the <code>x</code> in
<code>case x of</code>) unrestrictedly. See the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user guide</a> for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanisms to interface linear and non-linear code: <code>linear-base</code> comes with
<code>Ur</code>, which stands for unrestricted and lets you manipulate a
non-linear value in a linear context.
Hence, a function <code>f :: Ur a %1-&gt; b</code> can use the <code>a</code>
unrestrictedly after pattern matching on <code>(Ur x)</code>. Alongside this,
<code>linear-base</code> comes with the <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Unrestricted/Linear.hs">classes</a> <code>Consumable</code>, <code>Dupable</code> and
<code>Movable</code> which allow non-linear use of linearly-bound values; one can
<code>consume</code>, duplicate (possibly with <code>dup2 :: a %1-&gt; (a,a)</code>) or, <code>move</code> a
linearly bound value.</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>consume</span> <span>::</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>dup2</span> <span>::</span> <span>Dupable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
  <span>move</span> <span>::</span> <span>Movable</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ur</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are used throughout <code>linear-base</code> itself and are likely to
show up in linearly types programs. For instance,
the linearly-typed streaming function <code>chain</code> has
the following type</p>
<div data-language="hs"><pre><code>  <span>chain</span> <span>::</span> <span>forall</span> <span>a</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>y</span><span> . </span><span>(</span><span>Control.Monad</span> <span>m</span><span>,</span> <span>Consumable</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span> <span>%</span><span>1</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stream</span> <span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>m</span> <span>r</span></code></pre></div>
<p>because the <code>y</code> must be discarded as the monadic effect is chained
after each <code>a</code> in the stream.</p>
<h2>Advanced abstractions &amp; sneak peeks</h2>
<p>Finally, <code>linear-base</code> has several features still in the works. Please note
that some of these features like non-GC memory allocation, destination arrays
and push-pull arrays are still very experimental and likely to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Control/Optics/Linear/Internal.hs">optics</a> are optics re-designed to work in linear contexts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Foreign/Marshal/Pure.hs">Non-GC memory allocation</a>. We can use linear types to enforce the protocols for
using memory outside of GHC’s garbage collector and on the system heap, i.e., that
we allocate before use, necessarily free and do not use after that. Hence, the GC has
less work to do and we as programmers have the control over some allocation which
could impact the performance of our program.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Destination.hs">Destination arrays</a>. Destination arrays, provide a way to write code in
destination-passing-style. This lets us decide when we allocate space
for a write-only array that’s threaded throughout our program. If we instead
had just used a vector, we might not have had all the fusion we’d like and might
have had extra allocations which impact memory use and performance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/src/Data/Array/Polarized.hs">Push-pull arrays</a>. We can use linear-types to represent
<a href="https://jyp.github.io/posts/controlled-fusion.html">polarized arrays</a>. This enables us to provide a <code>vector</code>-like
API but explicitly control when allocation occurs. With the existing
<code>vector</code> library, one is often relying on array fusion to avoid
unnecessary allocations, but it can be hard to predict when array
fusion occurs. Polarized arrays can be either
output-friendly (a push array) or input-friendly (a pull
array) and neither form allocates. Only when a regular array is needed does
one <em>explicitly</em> allocate. So, controlling allocation is done by
the programmer, not the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Community first</h2>
<p>Our goal with <code>linear-base</code> is to make it easy and fun for the community to
write Linear Haskell programs. The first release is available on
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-base">Hackage</a> and comes with <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/tree/master/examples">examples</a> from
the repository, and, in addition to the haddock, a short <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md">user
guide</a>. Please feel welcome to <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/issues">point out bugs or request
features</a>. To check out the latest update, see <a href="https://github.com/tweag/linear-base">our GitHub

February 11, 2021 | https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2021/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you may have heard, JCenter is shutting down in May 2021.</p><blockquote><p>Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter<br><a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/</a></p></blockquote><p>So, if you are using JCenter as the repository for your libraries (as me), it’s time to migrate.</p><p>In this article, I will not go through the publishing process of a library to MavenCentral, because there are already plenty of resources available. For example, I followed the one written by Márton Braun.</p><blockquote><p>Publishing Android libraries to MavenCentral in 2021
<a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/</a></p></blockquote><p>Instead, the topic of this article is to show how to manually migrate the old artifacts of a library without recompiling them.</p><p>It’s important to migrate also the old artifacts because not all the users of your library are using the latest version. But if the library is old, it’s difficult to recompile it from scratch. For example, I’ve tried to manually rebuild the first version of <a href="https://github.com/prof18/YoutubeParser">YoutubeParser</a>, but I quickly failed because it was using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin of 5 years ago that is now incompatible with Android Studio 4.</p><h2>Download old artifacts from Bintray</h2><p>The first thing to do is downloading the old library’s artifacts from Bintray. It is possible to download them, directly from the Bintray directory page:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/%7Byour-bintray-username%7D/maven/%7Byour-library-name%7D">https://bintray.com/package/files/{your-bintray-username}/maven/{your-library-name}</a></p></blockquote><p>For example, this is the URL for my other library, <a href="https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser">RSS-Parser</a>: <a href="https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser">https://bintray.com/package/files/prof18/maven/RSS-Parser</a></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/bintray-dir.png"></a></figure><p>Here, it is possible to download the artifacts by simply clicking on them.</p><h2>Sign artifacts</h2><p>The next step is signing the artifacts, with a GPG key (to generate one, you can follow the instruction on <a href="https://getstream.io/blog/publishing-libraries-to-mavencentral-2021/">Márton‘s article</a>). The command to perform the signing is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="bash"> gpg -ab rssparser-1.0.pom
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/sign-terminal.png"></a></figure><p>Remember that all the files uploaded to MavenCentral must be signed. In my case, I have to sign the <em>.aar</em> file, the <em>.pom</em> and the <em>jar</em> that contains the sources and the <em>JavaDoc</em> of the library.</p><p>The signing command produces a <em>.asc</em> file, that must be uploaded as well on MavenCentral.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/signed-files.png"></a></figure><h2>Manual upload artifacts</h2><p>Now, it’s time to upload the artifacts. Login on <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/">Sonatype</a> and from the menu on the left, select <em>Staging Upload</em></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/manual-upload.png"></a></figure><p>First of all, in the <em>Staging Upload</em> section, it is necessary to upload the <em>pom</em> file.</p><p>Switch the upload mode to <em>Artifact(s) with a pom</em> in the dropdown window and then select to <em>pom</em> to upload.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-pom.png"></a></figure><p>Then, in the section below, it is possible to upload the other artifacts. To do that, it is necessary to select them from the file system with the <em>Select Artifact(s) to Upload…</em> button and then add them to the list with the <em>Add Artifact</em> button.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/artifacts-to-upload.png"></a></figure><p>Don’t forget to upload also the signatures (the <em>.asc</em> files)!</p><p>After adding all the artifacts, upload them with the <em>Upload Artifact(s)</em> button. It is also necessary to provide a brief description, for example <code>1.1 manual upload</code></p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/add-artifacts.png"></a></figure><p>It could happen the the upload is stuck and the progress bar never goes away. If it happens, reload the page and redo the process (I’ve noticed that it can happen when the browser tab is open for a while).</p><p>After the upload is successful, select <em>Staging Repositories</em> from the left menu.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/staging-repo.png"></a></figure><p>Now, the process is the same as when the artifacts are upload from Android Studio (or from the CI). The only exception is that the close task is started automatically (if it not starts, you can start it manually from the top bar).</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/move-libray-jcenter-to-maven/wait-close.png"></a></figure><p>The close task takes a few moments to perform, and after that, it’s time to release the library with the button in the toolbar.</p><p>And that’s it!

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 09 February 2021</em></p><p>INTERNET – Stack Overflow users today rejoiced at the prospect of Python’s
upcoming 3.10 release including the controversial new pattern matching feature
described in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/">PEP 634</a>.</p>

<p>“Python 3 has been out for a while, and the goldmine of Python 2 to 3 migration
questions has started to run dry since January 2020,” said one user, referring
to the end of life for the Python 2.x release series. “We were starting to
worry that we would run out of major language changes to confuse new developers.
But thanks to pattern matching, we should be set for another 5-7 years!”</p>

<p>The question answerers on the popular site, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, were commenting
on the upcoming Python 3.10 language feature of pattern matching, which allows
syntax such as the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>404</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Some other shit, sorry!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stack Overflow users gushed over its similarity to C’s <code>switch</code> statement. “New
users will see the <code>case</code> keyword and instantly feel comfortable based on their
knowledge of C,” one SO answerer remarked. “But that’s when we get them! <code>match</code>
is about subverting expectations, by assigning to variables when the programmer
expects a comparison. We’re going to earn so many Stack Overflow reputation
points this way.”</p>

<p>This user’s comments referred to the unexpected behavior of the match statement
when used with identifiers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>NOT_FOUND</span> <span>=</span> <span>404</span>
<span>match</span> <span>status_code</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"OK!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>NOT_FOUND</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"HTTP Not Found"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, rather than matching <code>status_code</code> against the value of
<code>NOT_FOUND</code> (404), Python’s new <del>SO reputation machine</del> match syntax would
assign the value of <code>status_code</code> to the variable <code>NOT_FOUND</code>. Another Stack
Overflow user explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the core developers finally looked at the numbers, and saw how few
questions Python 3.x was getting on Stack Overflow. Here’s a language that has
finally matured, and it really strikes a balance between usability and
predictability. When we reached out to the core development team about the
dire situation, the developers knew they had to step in and add an
unpredictable feature to rectify things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last time the Python language conspired so strongly to confuse new users was
the controversial “mutable default argument” feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>def</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[]):</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"myfunc({})"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>l</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>     <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>" l={}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>l</span><span>))</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>myfunc</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
 <span>l</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, some Stack Overflow users were not so rosy about the future of Python 3
questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sure, Python 3.10 is going to trigger a massive influx of questions. But that
doesn’t mean we’ll get more reputation points! Most mods are just going to
mark all the questions as duplicates, even if they don’t have good answers
yet. Pattern matching may be a beautifully booby-trapped new feature, but it’s
not going to save us from bad moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Perl community rallied in support of the latest developments in
the Python language. Said one Perl developer: “Honestly, I’m just glad Python
has finally given in to gratuitous new features, and Perl 7 is now the language
of reason and moderation. I can’t wait until they realize how many operators
they can overload.  Maybe Python 2.7 can make a comeback after all?”</p>
