The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_12181"><div><div><p>This question is interesting because it asks two questions that don't necessarily have to be related:</p><p>- is there an easy way to solve this<br>- is there a non-"brute force" way solve this</p><p>Before moving on I want to mention that this little snippet of R involves a lot more abstraction then it seems at first glance. What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>

<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the
paper
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf"><span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System</a> (1974)
by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and
F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>
<p>– <span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&nbsp;(1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included. Researchers do not always agree on which studies to include, and differences in inclusion criteria have led to similar meta-analyses producing opposite results. </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115934" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>This has occurred</u></a> <span>in studies of Vitamin D and fracture risk in older adults, with some meta-analyses showing zero benefit to Vitamin D and others showing a decreased risk of fracture, even though they included many of the same studies. </span></p><p id="viewer-donuf"><span>In addition to being high quality, the included studies should all try to answer the same clinical question. Many meta-analyses can only be done by combining trials that differ in important details, like the age of participants, treatment dosages, or definition of endpoints. Combining these may be feasible, but the clinical relevance may change when disparate groups are lumped together. For example, suppose we want to know if Vitamin D prevents asthma attacks in children. If a meta-analysis shows a small benefit to Vitamin D when all ages are combined, but the individual small studies in children did not show a benefit, what do I advise a 10 year old with asthma?</span></p><p id="viewer-9le66">Despite these challenges, meta-analyses of RCTs can provide meaningful insights. Unfortunately, most high-quality meta-analyses show similar results to our individual randomized controlled trials: <strong>Vitamin D does not appear to prevent disease in healthy adults.</strong> </p><p id="viewer-9hssp">But there are a few promising areas identified in meta-analyses. Note that some of these findings are not consistent with the large RCTs and will need to be studied further before definitive recommendations can be made. </p><p id="viewer-25ike">The areas in which meta-analyses have identified benefits from Vitamin D:</p><ol><li id="viewer-f3qjq"><p><strong>Fracture prevention in elderly nursing home residents </strong>(when also given with calcium):   This is not surprising. We know that Vitamin D and calcium can prevent bone loss in severe Vitamin D deficiency. Elderly adults who are not getting outside are more likely to be severely deficient in Vitamin D, and supplements likely help.</p></li><li id="viewer-fa0a9"><p><strong>Asthma and respiratory infection</strong>: Vitamin D seems to reduce asthma attacks in adults with mild to moderate disease, and daily or weekly Vitamin D seems to prevent acute respiratory infection in those with Vitamin D less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l). There is considerable excitement around Vitamin D's potential role in Covid treatment, though we do not yet have enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion. </p></li><li id="viewer-d7fj2"><p><strong>Cancer mortality</strong>: Vitamin D does not appear to prevent cancer, but may reduce death rates from cancer overall (when all cancers are combined) when Vitamin D is taken for several years. It is not known whether Vitamin D itself fights cancer. It could also be that individuals with cancer are more prone to developing severe Vitamin D deficiency, which leads to bone loss, fragility, and fractures, which increase mortality.</p></li><li id="viewer-cvias"><p><strong>Atopic dermatitis (eczema)</strong>: Vitamin D …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a thread</a> wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Gellis goes through his findings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this YouTube video</a>. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>
<p><strong>(Note: For more, <a href="https://www.samueljscott.com/2019/02/26/fake-online-fake-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see my recent talk on how much of the Internet is fake</a>.)</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Doom Eternal is the successor of Doom 2016. It’s developed using the 7th iteration of id Tech, id Software’s in-house game engine. Doom 2016 has inspired me greatly on a technologic level due to its simplicity and elegance while still having a high visual quality. For Doom Eternal, this is no different. Doom Eternal has improved in many areas of which a few are worth investigating which I will try to cover in this frame breakdown.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This frame breakdown is inspired by <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Adrian Courreges’s study on Doom 2016</a>. I believe these graphics studies give a lot of insight into how certain rendering problems are solved in a AAA game and are greatly educational. In this breakdown I aim to stay at a high level and not go too in-depth of each rendering technique/pass. Some passes might not be covered here because they are very similar to Doom 2016 and are well covered in Adrian Courreges’s study.</p>

<p>I do want to stress here that these studies are absolutely nothing more than <strong>educational</strong>. I do not in any way support the reverse engineering for malicious purposes and stealing intellectual property. If you haven’t played the game yet, don’t worry about spoilers! The section I used for this study is in the beginning of the game which doesn’t give away any of the details.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get down to business.</p>

<p>With Id Tech 7, the engine has moved away from OpenGL and is entirely built with a <strong>Vulkan</strong> backend allowing them to make better use of current generation GPU features, bindless resources in particular.</p>

<hr>



<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re looking at a section in the game close to the start. It’s an interior with a few enemies and a large portion of volumetric lighting. Just like its predecessor, Doom Eternal is using a <strong>forward rendering</strong> pipeline. Doom 2016 was mostly forward rendered with a thin G-Buffer for screen space reflections. However this time, everything is fully forward rendered omitting the G-Buffer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="step-away-from-mega-texture">Step away from Mega-Texture</h2>

<p>With id Tech 5 used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)">Rage</a>, there was a texture streaming concept introduced called ‘Mega-Texture’ which was also used in the previous Doom installment. This system works by rendering a so called ‘feedback texture’ each frame that contains the information of what texture data was visible, that texture is analysed next frame to determine which textures get streamed in from disk. This has an obvious flaw because once a texture is on screen, it’s basically already too late to load it and this causes blurry textures the first few frames it is on screen. In id Tech 7, id Software has stepped away from this approach.</p>

<h2 id="gpu-skinning">GPU Skinning</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens even before anything gets drawn to a texture, is evaluating skinning. This is commonly done in a vertex shader before shading. An alternative approach used here, is to do skinning beforehand in a compute shader which writes out skinned vertices to a buffer. This has a couple of advantages mainly not having to do skinning in the vertex shader for every geometry pass. This results in having less shader permutations because the vertex shader doesn’t have to know about skinning.</p>

<p>Skinning in a compute shader is not much different from in a vertex shader except that the output gets written to an intermediate buffer which can then be consumed in a vertex shader that can treat it as a regular static mesh. Just like in a vertex shader, for each vertex, a compute shader thread retrieves the transform of each bone affecting the vertex, transforms its position with each bone transform and adds up these positions based on the skin weights stored on the vertex.</p>

<p>János Turánszki wrote a wonderful write-up of how it can be implemented using a compute shader:
<a href="https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/">https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth noting here is the use of <strong>Alembic Caches</strong> in Doom Eternal. These caches contain baked animation which get streamed and decompressed at runtime. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmqWSZpgJY">Digital Foundry described in their tech breakdown</a>, this is used for a wide range of animations going from large cinematic pieces to small tentacles on the floor. This is especially useful for animations that are hard to achieve using skinned animation like organics and cloth simulation. You can compare an Alembic Cache with a video that can be played back and is highly compressed by looking ahead. I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz-7V_XiUA">Axel Gneiting’s talk at Siggraph 2014</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

<h2 id="shadow-mapping">Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Next up is shadow rendering. There doesn’t seem to be any large changes in how shadow maps are approached in id Tech 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>As seen below, shadows get rendered in a large 4096x8196px 24-bit depth texture which may vary across quality levels. The texture is persistent across frames and as described in “Devil is in the Details” at Siggraph 2016, the static geometry in the shadow map is cached to save having to redraw the shadow maps each frame. The technique is fairly simple: as long as nothing in the view of the light moves, there is no need to update the shadows. If a dynamic object in the frustum moves, a ‘cached’ shadow map is copied into the actual shadow map and the dynamic geometry is re-drawn on top. This cached shadow map is the same shadow map but only with static geometry because you can make the assumption that these will never change. This saves having to draw the entire scene in the frustum every time it needs to update. Of course, when the light moves, the entire scene has to be redrawn from scratch.</p>

<p>When sampling the shadow map during lighting, a 3x3 PCF sampling approach is used to smoothen the shadow edges. For the sun light, <strong>cascaded shadow maps</strong> are used to distribute the quality better as it covers such a large portion of the environment.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the shadow atlas. A light with higher importance, larger screen area or that is closer to the camera, will get a larger portion of the atlas assigned for better resolution. These heuristics are evaluated dynamically.</p>

<h2 id="depth-pre-pass-and-velocity">Depth Pre-pass and Velocity</h2>

<p>Opaque geometry gets rendered to a depth-only target starting with the player’s gun, then static geometry, and finally dynamic geometry. A depth pre-pass is common to avoid unnecessary pixel shader calculations later down the pipeline where geometry overlaps. A depth pre-pass is especially important in a forward renderer where redundant pixel calculations are extremely wasteful due to pixel overdraw. With a depth pre-pass, the actual forward lighting pixel shader can reject pixels by comparing with the depth buffer before execution, saving a lot of performance.</p>

  </ol>

    <span>Next</span>
  </a>
</p></div>

<p>Besides rendering depth, the pre-pass also renders to another color target. For dynamic geometry, the velocity is rendered using motion vectors which is the position of the current position subtracted from the position of the pixel in the previous frame. We only need the motion on the X and Y axis so the motion is stored in the red and green channel of a 16-bit floating point render target. This information is later used in post processing for applying motion blur and reprojection for temporal anti-aliasing. The image below is exaggerated because this snapshot doesn’t have a lot of motion. Static geometry does not need motion vectors as their motion can be derived from the camera motion because they have only “moved” relative to the camera.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-z-depth">Hierarchical-Z Depth</h2>

<p>Next up, a hierarchical mip chain of the depth buffer is generated which is similar to a mip map but instead of averaging 4 neighboring pixels, the maximum is taken. This is commonly done in graphics for various purposes like accelerating screen space reflections and occlusion culling. In this case, this mip chain is used to accelerate the light and decal culling which is covered later. More recently, mip generation is done in a single pass by writing into multiple mips at once. In Doom Eternal, it still traditionally does a dispatch for every mip separately.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mesh-decals">Mesh Decals</h2>

<p>Up until what I’ve covered so far, there haven’t been many noticeable changes compared to Doom 2016. However, “mesh decals” is an addition to the mesh rendering pipeline introduced in Doom Eternal. Unlike the common decal workflow - which are placed freely in the environment - a mesh decal is placed during the mesh authoring pipeline by artists and so belong to the mesh. Before, Doom heavily relied on decals and stepped it up with the addition of so called “mesh decals” in this game for even better detailing and flexibility. “Mesh decals” are small decals like bolts, grills, bumps, stickers, … Just like a traditional decal, it can modify any property of the underlying surface like the normal, roughness, base color, …</p>

<p>To achieve this, the following geometry pass renders each of the decals’s ID into an 8-bit render target. Later during shading, this texture is sampled to retrieve the ID which is used to retrieve a projection matrix bound with each draw call. The matrix projects the pixel’s position from world space into texture space. These coordinates are then used to sample the decal and blend with the underlying material. This is extremely fast and allows artists to go crazy with massive amounts of decals. Because the IDs are rendered to an 8-bit texture, the maximum amount of decals per mesh would theoretically be 255.</p>

<p>One requirement for this, is that all decals are bound to the pipeline when drawing meshes. Doom Eternal uses a fully bindless render pipeline which allows them to bind all decal textures at once and dynamically index them in the shader. More on this bindless pipeline later as this is important to pull off other tricks they’ve done in this game.</p>

<p>Below, the mesh decal texture. The different IDs are coloured to visualize it better.</p>

<p>At 16:09 EDT on 04 Sep 2020 (about 26 hours ago), SalesForce (the owner of web hosting company Heroku) notified us that they had suspended the Ruqqus live and test server environments, with account termination to follow twenty-four hours later.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, we have not been given a reason as to why we were being kicked. I do not believe we violated Heroku ToS (though Heroku may think otherwise) and we did not exceed Heroku usage limits. Our account manager was friendly but was unfortunately unable to provide us with any information. It is my opinion that by not warning us first (ex. "please remove X which violates Heroku's acceptable use policy") that Heroku actually violated their own terms of service.</p>
<p>We immediately downloaded all of the Ruqqus data, and began working on setting up shop at another host.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a massive shoutout to <a href="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang"><img src="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang/pic/profile">@p2hang</a> for lending his considerable expertise in support of getting Ruqqus operational as quickly as possible. He is the third recipient of the super-rare Fire Extinguisher badge.</p>
<p>All (or at least, almost all) functionality is restored. There are a few things which aren't quite yet back to normal, which I hope to fix over the course of tonight and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><del>hCaptcha verification issues on attempted signups</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Custom guild colors are currently disabled. This was an intentional decision by me, as there were issues loading the style files needed for custom coloring, so it was easier to just disable that for the sake of getting up and running.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Notification bell stuck on.</del></p>
</li>

<p><del>Lastly, and most importantly, we have no idea how well the current server will be able to handle user load. For that reason, I will be continuing to monitor and make adjustments as needed. Performance may be spotty and unreliable as load resumes.~~ ~~Doesn't seem to be an issue, but we'll have to see how it goes with everyone trying to get on.</del> There are some load/efficiency problems that I'm trying to sort out.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>07 Sep 2020</span></p><p>A programming language supports <em>named parameters</em> when one
can call a function supplying the parameters by name, as in
the following hypothetical example (using C++ syntax):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void f( int x, int y );

int main()
{
    f( x = 1, y = 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ is obviously not such a language and there have been
numerous proposals to rectify this omission, unfortunately none
of them successful. The latest attempt is Axel Naumann’s paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0671r2.html">Self-explanatory Function Arguments</a>,
which tries to attack the problem from another angle by just
allowing normal function calls to be tagged with the parameter
name, as in</p>



<p>enabling compilers to issue helpful warnings when a name doesn’t
match, but not allowing one to omit, or reorder, arguments.</p>

<p>Even in this limited form, named parameters would still be immensely
useful, but this is not what this post is about. What this post is
about is that we can already achieve something very close to named
parameters in C++20, by using a C99 feature called <em>designated
initializers</em>.</p>

<p>Designated initializers allow one to initialize structures by
member name, as in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x;
    int y;
};

A a1 = { .x = 1, .y = 2 };
A a2 = { .x = 3 }; // a2.y == 0
A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0
A a4 = { .y = 5, .x = 6 }; // valid C, invalid C++ (reorder)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ introduces a restriction C doesn’t have: the initializers
must follow the declaration order, similarly to how class member
initalizers are executed in member declaration order. But in
exchange, it allows us to supply default values:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
};

A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0, no warning
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can already see where this is going. Instead of</p>



<p>we declare</p>



<p>and then call it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int main()
{
    f({ .x = 1, .y = 2 });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/YfWj3W">GCC</a> and
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/vbnz4T">Clang</a> even without <code>-std=c++20</code> because
they support designated initializers in earlier language modes as
an extension, and it works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/bKozaW">MSVC</a>
with <code>-std:c++latest</code>.</p>

<p>For a more realistic example, consider this snippet, taken from real
code, that sets a 10 second
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/using_websocket/timeouts.html">timeout</a>
on a <a href="https://boost.org/libs/beast">Boost.Beast</a> websocket:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

void f1(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    auto opt = boost::beast::websocket::stream_base::timeout();

    opt.keep_alive_pings = true;
    opt.idle_timeout = std::chrono::seconds(10);

    ws.set_option(opt);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how we can reformulate it by using the above idiom and <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>
literals:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

void f2(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    ws.set_option({ .idle_timeout = 10s, .keep_alive_pings = true });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from the slightly awkward <code>({ ... })</code> syntax and the need to observe
the right parameter order, that’s not that far from the ideal; and it’s
considerably better than <code>f1</code>.</p>

<p>This also works for constructors. Consider this hypothetical <code>vector</code> class
that is like <code>std::vector</code>, except with its various constructor overloads
replaced with one taking named parameters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T, class A = std::allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt; class vector
{
private:

    struct params
    {
        std::size_t size = 0;
        T element{};
        std::size_t capacity = 0;
        A allocator{};
    };

public:

    explicit vector( params p );
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x17fdY">how it’s used</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>auto f()
{
    vector&lt;int&gt; v{{ .size = 4, .element = 11, .capacity = 64 }};
    return v;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, apart from the odd <code>{{ ... }}</code> syntax, not that bad.</p>

                            all of the usual tasks with ease.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p>Fosmon Portable Lightweight Mini Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Controller has been selected as the best option for YARH.IO's multifunctional design. If you are using Vim, tmux, and Emacs everyday, the available modifier keys will
                            help you get the most out of the device.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the keyboard, YARH.IO's pointing device will allow you to effortlessly browse the internet and engage with other applications with graphical interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>A single removable rechargeable battery will allow you to quickly replace an empty battery with a fully charged one. A high capacity Fenix ARB-L21-5000 5000mAh Li-ion Rechargeable Battery was chosen as the best option as it fits
                            the main module perfectly. For the charger/5v power supply the internals of a Fenix ARE-D1 Smart Charger were used.</p>

                        <p>YARH.IO features modular design, where the main module includes Raspberry Pi board, screen, power supply, battery, and RTC and GPIO connector with cables.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The main module can be used as a fully functioning handheld computer&nbsp;with the touch screen and onscreen keyboard available for the performance of your basic tasks.</p>
                        <p>One shared USB connector is available on the bottom of the main module, allows connecting USB devices like&nbsp;hard drives or Cellular/WiFi adaptors and mounted inside the extension module.</p>
                        <p>Raspberry Pi GPIO connector is also available on the bottom of the main module, allowing for different add-on modules,&nbsp;<br>including Lora radios, RFID readers/writers, and IR transivers, to&nbsp;be mounted inside the extension
                            module. This configuration works extremely well with Pi-DAC+, creating a great handheld audio player.</p>

                        <p>The outcome of this YARH.IO model is a successful handheld device with the potential to connect an unlimited range of extension devices and modules. It is a ruggedly designed and fully hackable device that can be 3D printed and
                            assembled in the field.<br></p>
                        <p>As an experimental model YARH.IO's future development will continue to increase usability and functionality of the device. One of the areas of improvement is the adaptation of IPS type screen for wider viewing angles.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>Other future development will focus on adding new compartment modules to accommodate additional I/O, storage and communication devices.&nbsp;<br></p>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of

    <p>i’m writing this like a day after <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90539632/mozilla-vows-mdn-isnt-going-anywhere-as-layoffs-cause-panic-among-developers">big mozilla layoffs</a> that included a lot of people working on cool and important shit.
the consensus i’m seeing is that it reflects mozilla’s search for profit over impact, mismanagement, and disproportionate executive compensation.
this is taking place in a larger trend of corporatization of open source over the past several years, an ongoing open source sustainability crisis, and of course COVID-19, the all-consuming crisis that makes all our other crises worse.
all of this was summed up most concisely by <a href="https://twitter.com/zkat__/status/1293626135142477825">Kat Marchán</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imo, open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes, and being replaced by open source as Big Corp entrenchment strategy.</p>

  <p>I mean it’s been happening for a while, but seeing Mozilla sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.</p>

  <p>FOSS is dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how did we get here?
where even are we?
what happens next?</p>

<p>i am incredibly unqualified to answer any of this - i didn’t show up until right around the peak of SourceForge, i wasn’t there for most of this - but i’m not gonna let that stop me.</p>

<h2 id="names">names</h2>

<p>to start this funeral service for FOSS, we have to unpack the term itself.
“free and open source software” as a term already contains multitudes.
on one hand, “free software”, an explicitly political movement with a decidedly anti-charismatic leader.
on the other hand, “open source software”, defanged and corporate-friendly by design.
the free software people (correctly) criticize “open source” as milquetoast centrism.
the open source people (correctly) criticize “free software” as stubborn idealism fighting tooth and nail to reject the real world as it actually exists.
they have as much in common as leftists and liberals (but they’re more prepared to work together), and although their short-term goals were similar enough that it made sense to lump them together (hence the cooperation), now that the movement is dead i think there’s more to gain from considering them separately.
most software licenses that i’m going to bring up technically qualify as both, but they’re popular with one or the other, so i’ll refer to “free software licenses” and “open source licenses” as licenses that are more directly tied to those movements, even though any given license likely meets both definitions.</p>

<p>i’d say free software died a while ago, and open source went horribly right.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">freedom</h2>

<p>the free software movement, for all its faults, has always known <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">what it’s about</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose.</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.</li>
    <li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>it’s concise, it’s understandable, and it’s… kinda useless.
this point was <a href="https://lu.is/blog/2016/03/23/free-as-in-my-libreplanet-2016-talk/">raised better by actual lawyer Luis Villa</a> (Karl Marx slander notwithstanding), but those freedoms don’t actually mean shit to the average end user.
only programmers care if they have access to the source code, and most people aren’t programmers.
and i <em>am</em> a programmer, and i don’t give a shit.
the freedom to not think about my operating system and just get work done overrules all of those for me, so i use windows.
like, yeah, those things are all in principle nice to have, and between two otherwise equally good programs i’d take the free one.
but they’re really fuckin specific things, and even if i have the freedom to do them i’m not likely to have the ability or desire to do them, so there’s no good reason for me as a user to use software that’s worse in other ways because it gives me freedoms i don’t need.</p>

<p>the free software movement is explicitly political, but its politics suck.
it’s a movement by and for ideological diehards but the ideology is extremely esoteric.
theirs was a losing battle from day one.
so what was it that actually killed them?
i think in a very real way it was the GPLv3.</p>

<h2 id="losing">losing</h2>

<p>the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the GNU pile of tools.
the Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn’t directly create more free software, though, since even things that tie closely to the kernel aren’t obligated to also be free software, and of course user-level applications can have whatever license they want.
and also most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident, distributed as ChromeOS or Android, neither of which is free software.
so Linux is a win for the free software movement but a useless one.</p>

<p>the GNU userland tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.
it may be technically more accurate to call it GNU/Linux, but the only time i remember my linux userland tools are GNU or free software at all is when there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/boring_cactus/status/1166408436386430976">some weird inconsistency between a GNU tool and its BSD equivalent</a>, and that’s not exactly ideal.
gcc had, as far as i can tell, been basically <em>the</em> C compiler for a while, if you weren’t stuck with MSVC or something worse.
the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities, but they still had one big technical advantage.
then the GPLv3 happened.</p>

<p>the GPLv2 was pretty popular at the time, but there were a couple notable loopholes some big corporations had been taking advantage of, which the free software people wanted to close.
a whole bunch of people thought the GPLv2 was fine the way it was, though - closing the loopholes as aggressively as the GPLv3 did cut off some justifiable security measures, and some people said that it could do more harm than good.
the linux kernel, along with a lot more stuff, declared it was sticking with the GPLv2 and not moving to the GPLv3.
when your movement says “here is the new version of The Right Way To Do Things” and several of your largest adherents say “nah fuck you we’re going with the old version” that is not a good sign.
around the same time, free software organizations were starting to successfully sue companies who were using free software but not complying with the license.
so big companies, like Apple, saw new restrictions coming in at the same time as more aggressive enforcement, and said “well shit, we want to base our software on these handy convenient tools like GCC but we can’t use GPLv3 software while keeping our hardware and software as locked together as we’d like.”
so they started pouring money into a new C compiler, LLVM, that was instead open source.</p>

<p>and LLVM became at least as good as GCC, and a less risky decision for big companies, and easier to use to build new languages.
so the free software movement’s last technical advantage was gone.
its social advantages also kinda went up in flames with the GPLv3, too: the software that was the foundation for the GPL enforcement lawsuits stuck with the GPLv2.
the discourse over that decision was so nasty that the lead maintainer (Rob Landley; he’ll come up later) started an identical project which he wound up relicensing under an open source license because the lawsuits had completely backfired: instead of complying with the terms of the GPL, companies were just avoiding GPL software.</p>

<p>the free software movement, in the end, burned itself out, by fighting for a tiny crumb of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.
the death of free software tells us that we can’t use a license to trick corporations into sharing our values: they want to profit, and if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they’ll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="openness">openness</h2>

<p>the open source movement manages to share the same short term goals as the free software movement but be bad in almost entirely disjoint ways.
the <a href="https://opensource.org/about">mission of the Open Source Initiative</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process.
The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability, greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is so profoundly different from the free software definition that it’s almost comical.
where free software says “we value freedom, which we define in these ways,” open source says “your code will get better.”
the free software movement was prepared to start fights with corporations that used their work but didn’t play by their rules.
the open source movement was invented to be a friendly, apolitical, pro-corporate alternative to the free software movement.</p>

<p>the contrast between “use free software because it preserves your freedom” and “use open source software because it’s better” is profound and honestly a little disappointing to revisit this explicitly.
free software preserves freedoms i don’t need or care about as a user, but it does at least do that.
open source software is frequently not in fact better than closed source alternatives, and “use open source software because on rare occasions it manages to be almost as good” is an even more underwhelming sales pitch than anything free software can give.</p>

<p>where free software is misguided and quixotic, open source is spineless and centrist.
and as tends to happen with spineless centrism, it has eaten the world.</p>

<h2 id="winning">winning</h2>

<p>if there’s anything corporations love more than rewriting software so it lets them make all the money they can dream of, it’s letting other people do that work for them.
it took a while to take off, because the conservative approach of “keep things closed source” was pretty solidly entrenched in a lot of places, but now even the once conservative holdouts have accepted the gospel of centrism.
corporations have little to nothing to lose by publishing existing source code, and can gain all sorts of unpaid volunteer labor.
if they start a new internal project, important enough that they’re …</p></div></div>

    <p>In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Yearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html">start tracking these patterns consciously</a>.</p>

<p>The broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html">read last year’s review first</a>: You can then diff my growth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It all began with a question: How do I grow further?</p>

<h2 id="growing-using-different-ladders-of-abstraction">Growing using different ladders of abstraction</h2>

<p>Entering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>

<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>

<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>

<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>

<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>

<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>

<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>

<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->

<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->

<h2 id="learning-good-habits-of-mind">Learning good habits of mind</h2>

<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>

<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>

<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-well">Thinking Well</h3>

<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html">a framework for critical thinking</a>. It’s compounding, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>

<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>

<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>

<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>

<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>
  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>
  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>



<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>

<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>

<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>

<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>

    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-slack">Protect your slack</h2>

<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>

<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>

<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>

<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>

<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>

<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>The creator of </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Component-Storage-System/" rel="nofollow">this project</a><span>, APTechnologies, came up with the idea for the storage cabinet by observing that he would run into trouble when organizing his component library. Rather than having to go across the workshop to get each part, he wanted a way to consolidate everything into one place for easy finding. The system works by first having the user search for a part on an adjacent screen, and then the associated bin will light up if the component is found in the system.</span></p><h3 id="toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><a href="#toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><i></i></a><span>Designing the Cabinet</span></h3><p>The storage solution is comprised of a 35 x 12 grid of drawers, which gives ample space for parts. The drawers are laid out according to the spacing between the LEDs in the strip (30 LEDs/meter). They are meant to be printed individually and then slotted in, plus they come in several different sizes.</p><h3 id="toc-fabrication-1"><a href="#toc-fabrication-1"><i></i></a><span>Fabrication</span></h3><p>Each drawer was 3D-printed on a Prusa Mk2S with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height. In order to minimize filament consumption, wall thicknesses are kept very thin, but even with this savings, 5kg of filament was required to fabricate the parts. There is also a small articulating arm that juts out from the side for the HDMI display.</p><h3 id="toc-software-2"><a href="#toc-software-2"><i></i></a><span>Software</span></h3><p>The primary way to interact with the system is through the terminal, which runs a Python 3 script. It begins by checking the text file for data integrity, where it then gets parsed and loaded into an object. Data is stored in CSV-style fashion, with the ID being the first column, the associated LEDs in the second, and finally the quantity in the third column. All subsequent values are optional and simply loaded by the user when the parts is located. A regex is used to parse the user's request, including searching for a component, changing its quantity, adding a new part, and removing a component.</p><h3 id="toc-electronics-3"><a href="#toc-electronics-3"><i></i></a><span>Electronics</span></h3><p>According to the project's creator, the choice for hardware components was quite straightforward. He used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a generic HDMI monitor to show the command line interface. For power delivery, he opted for a simple 5V adapter to power both the Raspberry Pi 4 and NeoPixel strip. Since the Pi outputs 3.3v signals from its GPIO pins, a level-shifter is needed, in this case a 74AHCT125. There is an option to use an Arduino Uno via UART if the NeoPixel strip is too unreliable, since the Arduino Uno can supply stricter timings.</p><h3 id="toc-usage-4"><a href="#toc-usage-4"><i></i></a><span>Usage</span></h3><p><span>To add a new part, the command </span><code>PI&lt;ledn&gt;:PI&lt;ledn+k&gt;, &lt;quantity&gt;[, optional parameters]:add</code><span> is sent, which adds a new component to the library. Other commands such as ID&lt;id number&gt; (search for part by ID) and ID&lt;id number&gt;:rm (remove part with that ID) exist to manage added components in the library.</span></p><h3 id="toc-possible-additions-5"><a href="#toc-possible-additions-5"><i></i></a><span>Possible Additions</span></h3><p>Although the system works well for one place and a small collection of components, it tends to scale poorly when there's a large library or multiple users want to interact with it. One way to solve this issue is to replace the single text file with a relational database such as MySQL, where parts can be stored and indexed in a single table, and other data can be referenced. This gives a very powerful interface for the software to easily search, add, and modify parts without having to read and rewrite the text file constantly.</p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236">Arduino “having11” Guy</a><span></span></span></p><p>18 year-old IoT and embedded systems enthusiast.

When I say “trying”, I really meant I spent some time configuring and using those editors. The ones I spent time using are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, my main, daily editor I use for pretty much almost all projects I work on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, that I currently use at work to hack on Java codebases.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, that I have been trying mainly in Rust, TOML and Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>, that I highly hacked around to play on my Haskell and Rust codebases (and YAML / Markdown / TOML too).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>, that I tried when I saw a colleague in a previous company I worked in (I was impressed by the “united” feeling of the UI and by how everything looked so slick). So I gave it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s take on editors. Same thing, mostly Rust, Haskell, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of others that I won’t talk about because I quickly stopped using.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this article is to create a temporal “snapshot” of my views on editors and what I think about the current situation. I have been using vim and especially neovim for more than a decade. I need to explain about my current workflow and what I cherish in editing before talking about each editors. Expect a point of view from a neovimer which is looking around at lots of editors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is only a personal workflow / point of view that works well <em>for me right now</em>. It doesn’t mean it will for you and it doesn’t mean a different workflow would be worse.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h2>
<p>I am French and I’m using a keyboard layout that is made to type very quickly in French and to code. With hindsight, since I type more often in English than in French, maybe I should have picked another keyboard layout, but the coding experience in my keyboard layout is really great, so I stick around.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout is <strong>bépo</strong>. I learned bépo the “recommended” way — i.e.&nbsp;you have to practice <em>typing</em> (« dactylographie » in French). It means that I use all my fingers to type on a keyboard, and that each key on the keyboard is assigned <em>a single finger</em> that will press it. That helps a lot with muscle memory and to reduce wrist pain (my wrists barely move when I type on a keyboard), among other things. The typing speed is a side-effect of being accurate and having good comfort (if you are curious, I’m pretty fast but there are faster people — I type at around 120 to 130 words per minute). Because I think the speed doesn’t matter when programming, I think the most important part to remember here is the comfort: the wrists don’t move and my fingers fly around the keyboard, whatever the speed.</p>
<h2 id="modal-editors">Modal editors</h2>
<p>I think a modal editor is superior, for various reasons. The first one is that I truly <strong>hate</strong> having to use a <em>mouse</em> for something that can be done without having to move around hundred of pixels with your cursor and clicking on buttons. For instance, running an application, on my current machines, is simply typing <code>alt d</code>, the name of the program (I typically use completion, so I never type fully the name of the program) and hit enter. All this without moving my hands from the keyboard. And I do that for programs like <code>firefox</code>, <code>kdenlive</code>, etc. but for terminal applications, I simply type and complete them in my terminal, which I open simply with <code>alt return</code>.</p>
<p>So, using a mouse to move around a cursor in an editor feels like completely suboptimal to me, especially because we write code (i.e.&nbsp;we type on a keyboard) most of the time, so moving around with the mouse implies several back and forth movements between the keyboard and the mouse. Maybe you don’t care and it’s cool to you, but to me, this is truly <em>horror land</em>. I feel <em>very</em> uncomfortable when doing this.</p>
<p>Also, <em>modern editors</em> that are not modal typically make people move by using the arrows keys, which are either far on your keyboard, or — like my keyboard, a 60% home made one — not in direct access and then require a function key to enable them.</p>
<p>So that’s the first reason why I like modal editors. They make a smarter use of your keyboard for simple yet recurrent features, like moving around — e.g.&nbsp;<code>h j k l</code>. The second reason why I like them is because of the facts they have a completely new mode for non-modal editor (i.e.&nbsp;the <em>normal</em> mode), you have a whole keyboard / lots of keys to bind actions to and do lots of things people usually do with the mouse. Being able to split an editor into several buffers, move around the buffers, go at the beginning of the paragraph, search and replace, register actions into macros and replay them, etc. All this without even moving the wrists. The learning curve is steep if you’re used to the mouse, but once you’ve passed the mental barrier, really, and this is a personal opinion, but I truly think that using the mouse again after that feels like handicap to me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-like-to-move-around">How I like to move around</h2>
<p>When I look at people coding, I see several kind of programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ones who move with the arrows or with <code>h j k l</code> in modal editors. You can spot them very easily at how the cursor moves in a document. It typically implies keeping a key pressed until the cursor reach a given row, then pressing another key until the cursor reach a given column and then adjust if they went passed the location they had in mind.</li>
<li>People using the mouse, by clicking at the place they want to put the cursor at.</li>
<li>People using <em>relative numbers</em>. That’s an enhancement of the first group: they typically use relative numbers to know which lines they want to jump to very quickly, so that they don’t have to press the up / down keys for ages until reaching the line they want to. Instead, they look at the number on the lines, press that number, and the direction, and bam, they are on the lines. They then use typical motions from vim like <code>$</code> (go to end of line), <code>f</code> (go to the first occurrence of the next character typed after <code>f</code>, like <code>f(</code> will make your cursor go to the next <code>(</code>), <code>%</code> (go to the matching delimiter) or <code>w</code> (go to the beginning of the next word) / <code>b</code> (go to the beginning of the previous word), etc. to move faster on the same line (it works across lines too).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents 99,9% of what I see people do. Obviously, you will get that I don’t belong to the second set of people… but I don’t really belong to any, actually. How I move is, I guess, convoluted for most people and I know some people won’t understand how it can feel. I use <code>h j k l</code> and all the motions from vim described in the third group (and even more; I full lecture of four hours would be required to explain all of them :D), but it all depends on the <em>distance</em> I need to travel. If my cursor is on a word and I want to move to the beginning of a word located very closely to my cursor on the same line, I’ll simply type <code>www</code> if it’s three words apart (or <code>3w</code> if I’m feeling funny). If the distance is higher, I use a tool called [EasyMotion].</p>
<p>Easymotion really is a wonderful tool. The idea is that it has several modes, depending on the kind of move you want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By lines</em>: this mode allows you to jump to any line in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By words</em>: tihs mode allows you to jump to any “word” in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By characters</em>: when the <em>word</em> mode doesn’t help with jumping to a special operator or character (because it’s not recognized as a word), this mode allows you to jump to any character in the current or (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li>It has other modes but I have never really found useful cases for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I typically do it is by mapping the three modes to <code>&lt;leader&gt;l</code>, <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;leader&gt;c</code> (in my case, <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> is the <em>space</em> key).</p>
<p>Typing <code>SPC l</code> in my current buffer results in this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_lines.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion lines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typing any highlighted character will make my cursor jump to it. The same applies for words, with <code>SPC w</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_words.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion words</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the <em>character</em> mode, after pressing <code>SPC c</code>, I have to press another character (the one I want to jump to). Let’s say we want to jump to a <code>#</code> (which is not part of words): <code>SPC c #</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_chars.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion characters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way of moving is not intuitive at first, but once you get used to it… it’s a <em>must have</em>.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-modal-candies">All the other modal candies</h2>
<p>Among all the things that I like about modal editing, here is a non-exhaustive list of features I expect to have around my fingers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-i</code> and <code>C-o</code>: those allows me to jump to something / a file / a place in a buffer and then go back to where I was right before with <code>C-o</code> (read it like <em>out</em>) or go back again with <code>C-i</code> (read it like <em>in</em>).</li>
<li>Macros and registers: those allow me to yank content into different registers (like clipboards) by assigning a single key to paste their content. For instance, I can put a few lines in my <code>t</code> register with <code>"tyi(</code> (“put in the <code>t</code> register the <code>y</code>ank <code>i</code>nside matching <code>(</code>), and paste that content later with <code>"tp</code>. Macros allow more powerful editing control by assigning a key to set of actions with the <code>q</code> keyword (<code>qa</code> will register all the next keystrokes and actions into the <code>a</code> macro). Then simply replay the macro with <code>@a</code>, for instance.</li>
<li>Obviously, all the basic vim motions, like <code>d</code> to delete, <code>y</code> to yank, <code>c</code> to change, <code>t</code> to go to the character right before the one you search, <code>%</code> to go to the other delimiter, etc. And more complex text manipulation, such as “Let’s change what’s inside this function parameter list, delimited by <code>(</code>”: <code>ci(</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take too much time to list everything, but the main idea is: I need the modal features when editing code.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the list of editors I mentioned in the preface. The idea is to give <em>my own opinion</em> on those …</p></div></section></div>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published September 06, 2020</p><p>PostgreSQL 13 development is coming along nicely, Postgres 13 Beta3 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2060/">released on 8/13/2020</a>.
The Postgres Beta 1 and 2 releases were released in May and June 2020.
One of the features that has my interest in Postgres 13 is the B-Tree deduplication effort.  B-Tree indexes are the default indexing method
in Postgres, and are likely the most-used indexes in production 
environments.
Any improvements to this part of the database are likely to have wide-reaching benefits.
Removing duplication from indexes keeps their physical size smaller,
reduces I/O overhead, and should help keep <code>SELECT</code> queries fast!</p>
<!--endteaser-->

<blockquote>
<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a good summary of the what and how of this improvement
in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/b-tree-index-deduplication/">Laurenz Albe's post</a> from early in June 2020, presumably using
Pg13 Beta1.  <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/06/features-in-pg13-deduplication-in-b-tree-indexes/">Hamid Akhtar's post in July</a>
covered this feature using Pg13 Beta2 and a different approach including
a look at the performance using <code>EXPLAIN</code>.
This post takes yet another look at this improvement using Pg13 Beta3.
I intend to see how well this improvement pans out on a data set I use in production.  For that task my go-to is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Postgres 13 Beta 3</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the two versions of Postgres (12 and 13beta3) 
on a single Ubuntu 18 host.  In the past when I have tested pre-production
releases I have built Postgres from source instead of using <code>apt</code>.
This time around I decided to use <code>apt install</code>, so am including the
basic process for that.</p>
<p>The advised way to install PostgreSQL is from the pgdg (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repositories,
see <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">the Postgres wiki</a> for more.
To enable the beta versions, the line needed in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/bionic-pgdg main 13
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, update the sources and install Postgres and PostGIS.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
# Postgres 12
sudo apt install postgresql-12 postgresql-12-postgis-3
# Postgres 13 (Currently Beta)
sudo apt install postgresql-13 postgresql-13-postgis-3
</code></pre>
<p>On Ubuntu, installing multiple versions will create multiple instances running on different ports. The test server I'm using to write this post
currently has three versions of Postgres installed, only two are currently running. Postgres 12 was installed first so "won" the default port of 5432.  Postgres 11 was installed second and was assigned 5433, and Pg13 beta 3 was installed last and was assigned port 5434.  The <code>pg_lsclusters</code> is avaiable on Debian/Ubuntu hosts as part of the wrapper around <code>pg_ctl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u postgres pg_lsclusters
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
11  main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
13  main    5434 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This post does not use Postgres 11 beyond this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with multiple versions installed it is helpful to verify
versions match what you expect them to be.
First, the port 5432 for Postgres 12 version.</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgosm -p 5432 -c "select version();"

<h2>Create Indexes</h2>
<p>Both versions of Postgres were loaded with the same Colorado OpenStreetMap
data loaded <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.
The osm2pgsql does not create any B-Tree indexes on its own, only the GIST
indexes on geometries.
For this post, we examine B-Tree index sizes created on four columns:
<code>osm_id</code>, <code>highway</code>, <code>waterway</code>, and <code>natural</code>.
Looking at the stats on the <code>public.planet_osm_line</code> table I can make 
a couple guesses where we will and will not see gains based on <code>n_distinct</code>.
I can guess we will not see major gains in the
<code>osm_id</code>, there is only a small amount of duplication in those values.
The other three columns (<code>highway</code>, <code>natural</code> and <code>waterway</code>) have a small number of distinct values
and varying amounts of <code>NULL</code> values.  These three columns would all
be candidates for partial indexes to avoid indexing the <code>NULL</code> values,
thus reducing the size of the created index.
I have hopes to see the benefits in Postgres 13 on these columns, possibly
making the use of partial indexes less frequent.</p>
<pre><code> SELECT attname, n_distinct, null_frac
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stats
    WHERE tablename = 'planet_osm_line'
        AND attname IN ('osm_id', 'highway', 'waterway', 'natural')
;

â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>osm_id</code></h3>
<p>First up is the <code>osm_id</code> column, a nearly unique set of positive and 
negative values.  The index to create in both versions:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_osm_id ON public.planet_osm_line (osm_id);
</code></pre>
<p>The following query is used throughout to report out index sizes.
The query itself will not be repeated, as only the filter would change.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ai.schemaname AS s_name, ai.relname AS t_name,
        ai.indexrelname AS index_name,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
        pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_bytes
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes ai
    WHERE ai.indexrelname LIKE 'ix_osm_line%'
    ORDER BY index_name
;
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the low number of duplicates, it is no surprise that the
show only a tiny reduction in the size.  The reduction
would not be detectable from only the <code>index_size</code> column (in MB), the
<code>index_size_bytes</code> shows the slight reduction in size (29,515,776 bytes vs. 29,384,704 bytes).</p>
<p>Pg 12.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€[ RECORD 1 ]â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”�

</code></pre>
<h3>Index on <code>highway</code></h3>
<p>The <code>highway</code> data in the <code>planet_osm_line</code> data is a good example of when
a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html">partial index</a>
might typically be a good idea to minimize index size.  My hunch (and hope)
is that the de-duplication will make a partial index here a moot point by reducing the size required to index a large number of <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>Create two indexes, one partial covering the non-<code>NULL</code> values and one full
index on the entire table.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_partial 
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway)
    WHERE highway IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_full
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway);
</code></pre>
<p>The two indexes in Postgres 12, notice the partial index cuts out about 1/3 of the size from the full index.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was <strong>almost</strong> like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.</p><p>I say <strong>almost</strong>, because as much as you want it to be, <strong>Elixir is not Ruby</strong>. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, <strong>Elixir is all about Erlang.</strong> The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Erlang</a> that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png" alt="" width="500" height="700"><figcaption>Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers</figcaption></figure><p>Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java, &nbsp;.NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.</p><p>This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it. This applies both to when things go well, as well as when they go south.</p><p>My biggest hope of all is that by understanding Erlang well enough, the Elixir community will start looking for new uses for it. Uses that go beyond being a scalable replacement for Rails apps. More daring and more ambitious uses, where Erlang's resilience model can prove to be critical for the success of the mission. I'd love to see it used in transportation, space, as well as the domain that started it all- telecommunications.</p><blockquote>“Shoot for the moon.
