    <p>by Francis Tseng</p>

<p>The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.</p>

<p><a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation">The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities</a>, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/">Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”</a> that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Urbit, “<a href="https://urbit.org/">a personal server built from scratch</a>,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.</p>

<p>My central question is this: <em>Is Urbit a project that should be supported?</em></p>

<p>We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?</p>

<p>The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government</a>. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a> is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/">one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right</a>. From 2007 to 2014<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and in parallel with his political writings<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik">Dog-whistles</a> have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his <a href="https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt</a> for questions around Urbit’s governance.</p>

<p>To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis">here</a>, <a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/">here</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">here</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/">Against Political Freedom</a>,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">neoreactionary” movement</a>, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">with Peter Thiel</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon">Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön</a>, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.</p>

<h2 id="urbit">Urbit</h2>
<h4 id="a-self-sovereign-internet">A self-sovereign internet</h4>

<p>Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).</p>

<p>Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. <em>But</em>, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> of corporate tyranny and serfdom.</p>

<p>To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html">a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists</a>”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.</p>

<p>In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?</p>

<p>One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt">used to use explicitly feudal metaphors</a> as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.</p>

<p>In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, ch. 7.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Active Listening</em>:<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
<a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/active-listening.pdf">Active Listening</a>, p. 2</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, advice and information are almost always seen as efforts to change a person and thus serve as barriers to his self-expression and the development of a creative relationship.</p></blockquote><p>You can find similar advice in most books on relationships, people management, etc.</p><p>This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want <em>results</em>, not to grouse into the void!<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
Empirically, I did notice that I usually got better results from listening than from giving advice. So I inferred that this advice was true for other people, but not me, because other people didn’t actually want to fix their problems.</span></span></sup></p><p>Frequently the “just listen” advice comes with tactical tips, like “reflect what people said back to you to prove that you’re listening.” For instance, consider these example dialogues from <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>:<sup><label for="sn3">§</label><span><span><sup>§</sup>
<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, Chapter 7, Exercise 5.5, 5.6 and solutions.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</p><p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?</p></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><p>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him.</p><p>Person B: So you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than he is?</p></blockquote><p>I say this with great respect for <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, but these sound like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">1970s-era chatbot</a>. If I were Person A in either of these dialogues my next line would be “yes, you dingbat—can you turn the nonviolence down a couple notches?” I’d feel alienated knowing that someone is going through their NVC checklist on me.</p><hr><p>Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners <em>do</em> often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank">cargo cult advice</a>: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s <em>generating</em> that surface appearance.</p><p>The generator is curiosity.</p><p>When I’ve listened the most effectively to people, it’s because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a <em>detailed, precise</em> understanding of what was going on in their head. When a friend says, “I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him,” that one sentence has a huge amount underneath. How often does she need him? What does she need him for? Why isn’t he around? Have they talked about it? If so, what did he say? If not, why not?</p><p>It turns out that <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding" target="_blank">open it up and see the gears inside</a>. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.</p><p>Some stories from recent memory:</p><ul><li><p>When we started doing a pair programming rotation at Wave, I suggested that, to make scheduling easier, we designate a default time when pairing sessions would happen. A coworker objected that this seemed authoritarian. I was extremely puzzled, but they’d previously mentioned being an anarchist, so I was tempted to just chalk it up to a political disagreement and move on. But instead I tried to get curious and explore more deeply whatever “political” models were generating that disagreement. After a lot of digging into what was or wasn’t authoritarian for them and why, it turned out the disagreement was because they’d missed the word “default” and thought I was suggesting a single <em>mandatory</em> time for pair programming.</p></li><li><p>My partner, Eve, wrote a post about Polish attitudes about sex, with some details that upset her (Polish) parents. When her parents told her that, she initially got very stressed about having to have a conversation to calm them down. I thought she shouldn’t be worried and the conversation would be fine, but of course just telling her that wasn’t very helpful. Instead, I summoned up my curiosity and asked lots of questions about her relationship with her parents, her parents’ relationship with each other, each of their relationships with Catholicism, etc. By the end of the conversation, after thinking through all the baggage involved, Eve agreed with me, and her attitude about the upcoming conversation shifted from impending doom to compassionate curiosity about where her parents were coming from.</p></li><li><p>I was stressed by work and complained to Eve about some things that I felt frustrated and stuck about. Instead of suggesting solutions, she kept asking for more details until she had more or less a complete snapshot of my mental state. At that point, she observed that every time I mentioned feeling sad, I sounded contemptuous and exasperated with myself. She hypothesized that I wasn’t giving myself permission to be sad. The “solution” to my problem ended up being to give me a big hug and let me cry on her shoulder for a bit, after which I immediately felt much less stressed.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the “helper” tried to learn about the “complainer’s” reality in as much detail as possible—not just the problem, but the whole person and whatever else was behind the immediate issue. And that’s what made it possible for them to actually help.</p><p>It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I’m usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I’m talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.</p><p>It turns out this is a really common failure mode of helping-conversations, which is what I think generates the old saw at the beginning of this post, that “sometimes people don’t want help, just to be listened to.”</p><p>But I think that’s actually too nice to the helper, and uncharitable to the complainer (in that it assumes they weirdly don’t care about solving their problem). What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.</p><hr><p>When I’m curious about what someone’s saying, I often do repeat things back to them in my own words. But it’s because I’m genuinely curious, not because I’m checking off the “reflect words” box in my “be a good listener” checklist. That means I do it in a way that sounds like my natural speech, instead of mimicking them like a chatbot.</p><p>When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It’s a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say. Putting their idea into my own words shows them that I’ve fully digested it, and helps us establish a shared language in which to talk about it. That, in turn, makes the conversation fluent and collaborative, rather than a zigzag of bad assumptions and corrections.</p><p>So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can. Once you’ve done that, your advice will be more likely hit the mark, and you’ll be able to communicate it clearly.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We are excited to announce Rizin — a <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open-source</strong> Reverse Engineering framework, providing a complete binary analysis experience with features like Disassembler, Hexadecimal editor, Emulation, Binary inspection, Debugger, and more.</p><p>Rizin is a fork of radare2 with a focus on usability, stability, and working features, which strives to provide a welcoming environment for developers and users alike. Rizin was founded by a group of the core developers of radare2 and Cutter who contributed to the project in one way or the other in the past years and together constructed the Core group of radare2. With the establishment of Rizin, we are committed to creating an environment and a project which will be aligned with our values and vision.</p><p>During recent years, the environment that was created in radare2 was one where many of us felt stressed, disrespected, and unwelcome. Moreover, the number of users of radare2 grew every year, and we held the ultimate responsibility to provide them a stable, usable framework. As the core developer team, we have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for us to continue to pursue the goal of making radare2 better under the current circumstances and environment, and we decided to move forward on our own and fork the project. Cutter, the Graphical User Interface for radare2, and its entire team will also join Rizin and will use it as its backend.</p><p>Rizin is a newborn project that was created from radare2, hence more and more changes and differences will appear over time. A lot of efforts were put into improving our workflows, putting more tests in place, improving the API, removing redundant features, and more.

<p>You have a file, possibly a huge CSV, and you want to import its content into your database. There are lots of options to do this but how would you decide which one to use. More often than not the&nbsp;question is how much time would the&nbsp;bulk load would take. I found my self&nbsp;doing the same few days back when I wanted to design a data ingestion process for PostgreSQL where we needed to bulk load around 250GB of data from CSV files every 24 hours.</p>



<p>Goto solution for bulk loading into PostgreSQL is the native copy command. But one limitation with the copy command is that it requires the CSV file to be placed on the server. So I decided to do a simple comparison of bulk loading options and techniques.</p>



<p>In short I wanted to see the performance difference of loading the data into standard vs unlogged tables and want to compare the loading time difference between loading into table that has an index vs drop-index-&gt;load-&gt;recreate-index option.</p>



<p>Moreover, I wanted to see the performance difference of COPY command, client-side copy command, loading through file_fdw, and pg_bulkload for each of the above options.</p>



<h2>Database and system settings</h2>



<p>Since the intention was to do a relative performance comparison among different data loading techniques and options, so using the personal MacBook Pro running macOS Catalena with 16GB of RAM, 2.7 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 processor, and 500 GB SSD disk was good enough to serve the purpose. </p>



<p>For database I compiled PostgreSQL v12 from source code with default configure options. I left most of the configuration parameter to their default values and only changed the below mentioned settings.</p>



<pre><code>shared_buffers = 2GB
work_mem = 400MB
maintenance_work_mem = 640MB
</code></pre>



<h2>Sample data and schema</h2>



<p>For the purpose of this exercise, I downloaded a sample CSV file from <a href="http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-18-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-sales/">http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-18-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing-sales/</a> with 5million rows.</p>



<p>The sample CSV file contains 5 million rows, 14 columns and 624MB in size.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="2618" height="390" src="https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv.png 2618w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-300x45.png 300w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-1024x153.png 1024w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-768x114.png 768w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-1536x229.png 1536w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-2048x305.png 2048w, https://www.highgo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sample-csv-1920x286.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2618px) 100vw, 2618px"></p>



<p>To keep things simple I created a sales_record table in PostgreSQL with one to one mapping with the CSV file</p>



<pre>CREATE TABLE sales_record 
(
	region VARCHAR,
	country VARCHAR,
	item_type VARCHAR,
	sales_channel VARCHAR,
	order_priority CHAR,
	order_date DATE,
	order_id INT,
	ship_date DATE,
	unit_sold INT,
	unit_price FLOAT,
	unit_cost FLOAT,
	total_revenue FLOAT,
	total_cost FLOAT,
	total_profit FLOAT
);</pre>



<p>Along with that I also wanted to see the impact of having an index on the bulk load performance, So for tests that&nbsp;require&nbsp;an INDEX, I created a <code>btree</code> index on the <code>country</code> column.</p>



<pre><code>CREATE INDEX country_idx ON sales_record USING btree (country);</code></pre>



<h2>Load using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY</a> command</h2>



<p><code>COPY</code>&nbsp;moves data between&nbsp;PostgreSQL&nbsp;tables and standard file-system files. The copy command comes in two variants, COPY TO and COPY FROM. The former copies the table content to the file, while we will use the latter to load data into the table from the file.</p>



<pre><code>COPY sales_record FROM '/Users/muhammadusama/work/data/5m_Sales_Records.csv' CSV HEADER;</code></pre>



<h2>Load using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html">psql</a> ‘\copy’</h2>



<p>‘<code>\copy</code>‘ is a <code>psql</code> operation that runs an&nbsp;SQL&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY</a>&nbsp;command, but instead of the server reading or writing the specified file,&nbsp;<code>psql</code>&nbsp;(client) reads or writes the file and routes the data between the server and the local file system. This means that file accessibility and privileges are those of the local user, not the server, and no SQL superuser privileges are required.</p>



<pre>\copy sales_record FROM '/Users/muhammadusama/work/data/5m_Sales_Records.csv' csv header;</pre>



<h2>Through <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/file-fdw.html">file_fdw</a></h2>



<p>The foreign-data wrapper&nbsp;<code>file_fdw</code>, can be used to access data files in the server’s file system, or to execute programs on the server and read their output.&nbsp;We can also use the file_fdw to load data from CSV to PostgreSQL tables.</p>



<pre><code>-- Create file_fdw extension and foreign server
CREATE  EXTENSION file_fdw ;
CREATE SERVER file_fdw_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER file_fdw; 

-- Define the foreign table that points to our CSV file
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_sales_record (
	region VARCHAR,
	country VARCHAR,
	item_type VARCHAR,
	sales_channel VARCHAR,
	order_priority CHAR,
	order_date DATE,
	order_id INT,
	ship_date DATE,
	unit_sold INT,
	unit_price FLOAT,
	unit_cost FLOAT,
	total_revenue FLOAT,
	total_cost FLOAT,
	total_profit FLOAT) SERVER file_fdw_server
		OPTIONS (
			format 'csv',
			header 'false' ,
			filename '/Users/muhammadusama/work/data/5m_Sales_Records.csv',
			delimiter ',',
			null '');

-- Copy the data from foreign table to local table
INSERT INTO sales_record SELECT * from foreign_sales_record;
</code></pre>



<p>Although <code>file_fdw</code> is not expected to be as fast as COPY command when it comes to loading the data but it provides a lot of flexibility and options when it comes to pre-processing the data before loading.</p>



<h2><a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_bulkload">pg_bulkload</a> tool</h2>



<p>pg_bulkload is also a very interesting option when it comes to high speed data loading. Its an open-source tool that achieves its performance by skipping the shared buffers and WAL logging.</p>



<pre><code>-- CREATE pg_bulkload extension
$ bin/psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_bulkload" postgres

-- Create control file with appropriate contents
$ more sample_csv.ctl 
WRITER = PARALLEL
OUTPUT = public.sales_record  # [&lt;schema_name&gt;.]table_name
INPUT = /Users/muhammadusama/work/data/5m_Sales_Records.csv  # Input data location (absolute path)

TYPE = CSV           # Input file type
QUOTE = "\""         # Quoting character
ESCAPE = \           # Escape character for Quoting
DELIMITER = ","      # Delimiter

-- Execute pg_bulkload utility
$ bin/pg_bulkload -d postgres -h localhost sample_csv.ctl
</code></pre>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>Below chart shows the time taken by each tool/command to load 5 million rows from CSV file </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Each method for data loading has its own pros and cons which may make one preferred choice over others for a particular use case. But when it comes to raw performance pg_bulkload is a clear winner with COPY and /copy line up behind while file_fdw stands at the last place.</p>



<p>While no matter which data loading method we use, loading into an indexed table is always slow, So do consider <code>drop-index-&gt;load-&gt;create-index </code>when you have a huge data to be loaded.</p>



<blockquote><p>Comparison of all the tools was an apple to apple comparison with both client and server were running on the same machine. So, /copy had no network overhead. In the case of PostgreSQL server and client are on different<em> machines the /copy command may not perform as well as these above results.</em></p></blockquote>

						<p>We’ve been in this pandemic since&nbsp; March and once the pandemic started I was having plenty of free time, And I need to use that time wisely, So I’ve decided to take the OSWE certification and I finished the exam on 8 of August, after that, I took a couple of weeks to recover from the OSWE exam, then in the med of September, I said you know what? I did not register my name in the Facebook hall of fame for 2020 as I do every year. okay, let’s do it.</p>

<p>I never found a vulnerability on one of Facebook subdomains, and I took a look at some writeups and I saw one writeup in one of Facebook subdomains which It got all my attention It was a great write up you can check it out <a href="https://ysamm.com/?p=280">[HTML to PDF converter bug leads to RCE in Facebook server.]</a></p>
<p>So after reading this writeup now I took a good idea about how many vulnerabilities I could find in such a huge web app.</p>

<p>So my main target was https://legal.tapprd.thefacebook.com and my goal was RCE or something similar.</p>

<p>I ran some fuzzing tools just to get the full endpoints of this web app and I took a 2 hours nap and watched a movie, Then I got back to see the results okay I got some good results.</p>

<p>Dirs found with a 403 response:</p>

<p>Okay, I think this result is very enough to support my previous theory about how huge this application, Then I started to read the javascript files to see how the website works and what methods it uses ..etc</p>

<p>I noticed a way to bypass the redirection into the Login SSO, https://legal.tapprd.thefacebook.com/tapprd/portal/authentication/login and after analyzing the login page, I noticed this endpoint</p>
<p><strong> /tapprd/auth/identity/user/forgotpassword</strong></p>
<p>and after doing some fuzzing on the user endpoint I’ve noticed another endpoint which its <strong>/savepassword&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>and it was expecting a POST request, Then after reading the javascript files I knew how the page work, there should be a generated token and xsrf token.. etc The idea that first came to me okay, Lets test it and see if it will work I tried to change manually using burp suite but I got an error, the error <em>was execution this operation failed</em>.</p>

<p>I said okay, this might be because the email is wrong or something? let’s get an admin email, Then I started to put random emails in a list to make a wordlist and after that, I used the intruder and I said let’s see what will happen.</p>
<p>I got back after a couple of hours I found the same error results plus one other result, This one was 302 redirect to the login page, I said wow, I’ll be damned if this worked Haha.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to see what I’ve done here, I sent random requests using intruder with a CSRF token and random emails with a new password to this endpoint <em><strong>/savepassword</strong></em></p>
<p>and one of the results was 302 redirect.</p>
<div id="attachment_128"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-128" loading="lazy" src="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login.png" alt="fbredtrect" width="989" height="446" srcset="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login.png 1671w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login-300x135.png 300w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login-1024x461.png 1024w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login-768x346.png 768w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/redirect-login-1536x692.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-128">Redirect</p></div>
<p><strong>Now I went to the login page and I put the login email and the new password and BOOM I logged in Successfully into the application and I can enter the admin panel 🙂</strong></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin.png" alt="" width="882" height="468" srcset="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin.png 1785w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin-300x159.png 300w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin-1024x543.png 1024w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin-768x407.png 768w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fblegal-admin-1536x815.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px"></p>

<p>I read the hacker report who found RCE before using the PDF and they gave him a reward of 1000$ only so I said okay, let’s make a good Impact here and a perfect exploit.</p>
<p>I wrote a quick and simple script to exploit this vulnerability with python you put the email and the new password and the script will change the password.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Exploit1.png" alt="" width="983" height="123" srcset="https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Exploit1.png 983w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Exploit1-300x38.png 300w, https://alaa.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Exploit1-768x96.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px"></p>
<p><strong>The Impact here was so high because the Facebook workers used to login with their workplace accounts, Which mean they’re using their Facebook accounts access token, and maybe if another attacker wanted to exploit this it might give him the ability to gain access to some Facebook workers accounts .. etc&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Then I reported the vulnerability and the report triaged.</p>

<p><strong>And on 2 of October, I received a bounty of 7500$&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I enjoyed exploiting this vulnerability so much, so I said that’s not enough, this is a weak script! let’s dig more and more.</p>
<p>And I found two more vulnerabilities on the same application, But we will talk about the other vulnerabilities in the Part two writeup 🙂</p>

December 12, 2020 | https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-yo-wasm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-yo-wasm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is a portable standard for bytecode, allowing code to be compiled to an efficient representation that’s amenable to just-in-time optimisation, and to be run on the operating system and runtime environment of your choice.  An ever-increasing number of languages offer compilation to Wasm, and Wasm runtimes are available in major browsers and as separate programs.  The existence of runtimes outside the browser, such as <a href="https://wasmtime.dev/"><code>wasmtime</code></a> and <a href="https://wascc.dev/"><code>waSCC</code></a>, opens up the possibility of using WASM as a general-purpose bytecode format, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java bytecode</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language">.NET CIL</a>.  For example, the <a href="https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-krustlet/">Krustlet</a> project provides a way to run WebAssembly modules as Kubernetes pods, performing compute work or serving HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Although languages such as <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm">C/C++</a> can compile to WASM, it’s not always obvious how to set up projects in this way - there is extra ceremony compared to most languages’ “native” target.  Setting up debugging and deployment also involves extra steps too, and those aren’t always obvious.  So there’s a barrier to entry in the first place, and unwelcome configuration every time you create a new project.</p>

<p>To make this a bit easier, we’re building a Wasm project generator, using the popular <a href="https://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> code generator, to take care of this setup for you.  We’ve just released the first preview and we’d love folks to try it out and let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>To install Yeoman and the Wasm generator, you’ll need to have Node.js and NPM already installed; then run:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-wasm
</code></pre>

<p>Then generate your new project:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir myproject
cd myproject
yo wasm
</code></pre>

<p>The generator will ask you a few questions, of which two are interesting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Which language do you want the project generated in?  At the moment, we can do Rust, C and AssemblyScript.  We’d be delighted to have more.</p></li>

<li><p>Do you want to publish the compiled Wasm module to an OCI registry, and if so which one?  This is relevant for workloads that you envisage running in a cloud environment such as Kubernetes with Krustlet.  You don’t have to publish to an OCI registry; if you do, we currently only offer Azure Container Registry, but again would love to extend that to other OCI registries.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QYAQcHH.png" alt="Project setup in yo wasm"></p>

<p>The result of all this is a “hello, world” application.  The code itself is uninteresting, being just a minimal Rust, C or AssemblyScript program, but the generator also provides a bunch of things to make the development experience easier:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Visual Studio Code tasks to build and debug the Wasm build.  This means that - if you’re a VS Code user - you can get up and running editing and debugging the project very quickly.  The Debug Wasm debug configuration uses <code>wasmtime</code> to run the program, and the LLDB debugger to support breakpoints, etc. in the running Wasm.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ypz6o0P.png" alt="The Debug WASM configuration in VS Code"></p></li>

<li><p>GitHub actions to build pull requests, and to publish the compiled Wasm module to your chosen OCI registry when you merge to <code>main</code> or tag a release with a string of the form <code>v*</code> (e.g. <code>v1.0.0</code>).  (If you chose not to publish to an OCI registry, this action just creates a build artifact.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARpY3jl.png" alt="Build and publish workflows running out of the box"></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The preview release has some limitations.  We’ve mentioned the limited language and registry options.  One important restriction is that all our current templates target WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) and the <code>wasmtime</code> runtime.  We’d love to have templates for other environments and runtimes, but we could really do with feedback on that before we invest in it.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll give <code>yo wasm</code> a try.  Please let us know if you run into any problems by raising an issue at <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/generator-wasm/issues">https://github.com/deislabs/generator-wasm/issues</a>, or feel free to send a pull request if there’s something you’d like to add or improve.  Thanks!</p>

December 12, 2020 | https://vectorized.io/blog/tpc-buffers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vectorized.io/blog/tpc-buffers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/redpanda-raison-detre">As I have previously observed</a>, software does not run on category theory, it runs on superscalar CPUs with wide, multi-channel GB/s memory units and NVMe SSD access times in the order of 10-100’s of microseconds. The reason some software written a decade ago - on a different hardware platform - feels slow is because it fails to exploit the advances in modern hardware.</p>
<p>The new bottleneck in storage systems is the CPU. SSD devices are 100-1000x faster than spinning disks and are 10x cheaper today[1] than they were a decade ago, from $2,500 down to $200 per Terabyte. Networks have 100x higher throughput in public clouds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.</p>
<p>Although computers did, in fact, get faster, single-core speeds remain roughly the same. The reason being that CPU frequency has a cubic dependency on power consumption, and we’ve hit a wall. Instruction level parallelism, prefetching, speculative execution, branch prediction, deep hierarchy of data caches and instruction caches, etc, have contributed to programs <em>feeling</em> faster when you interact with them, but in the datacenter, the material improvements have come from the rise in core count. While the instructions per clock are 3x higher than a decade ago, core count is up 20x.</p>
<p>This is all to say that the rise of readily available, many-core systems necessitates a different approach for building infrastructure. Case in point[9]: in order to take full advantage of 96 vCPUs on a i3en.metal on AWS, you’ll need to find a way to exploit sustained CPU clock speed of 3.1 GHz, 60 TB of total NVMe instance storage, 768 GiB of memory and NVMe devices capable of delivering up to 2 million random IOPS at 4 KB block sizes. This kind of beast necessitates a new kind of storage engine and threading model that leverages these hardware advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Redpanda</a> - a Kafka-API compatible system for mission critical workloads[3] - addresses all of these issues. It uses a thread-per-core architecture with Structured Message Passing (SMP) to communicate between these pinned threads. Threading is a foundational decision for any application, whether you are using a thread-pool, pinned threads with a network of Single Producer Single Consumer SPSC[7] queues, or any other of the advanced Safe Memory Reclamation (SMR) techniques, threading is your ring-0, the true kernel of your application. It tells you what your sensitivity is for blocking - which for Redpanda is less than 500 microseconds - otherwise, Seastar’s[4] reactor will print a stack trace warning you of the blocking since it effectively injects latency on the network poller.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on your threading model, the next step is your memory model and ultimately, for storage engines, your buffer management. In this post, we’ll cover the perils of buffer management in a thread-per-core environment and describe <code>iobuf</code>, our solution for a 0-copy memory management in the world of Seastar.</p>
<h2 id="Request-Flow-Architecture">Request Flow Architecture<a href="#Request-Flow-Architecture" aria-label="Request Flow Architecture permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Redpanda uses a <em>single</em> pinned thread per core architecture to do everything. Network polling, submitting async IO to the kernel, reaping events, triggering timers, scheduling compute tasks, etc. Structurally, it means nothing can block for longer than 500 microseconds, or you’ll be introducing latency in other parts of your stack. This is an incredibly strict programming paradigm, but this opinionated idea forces a truly asynchronous system, whether you like it or not as the programmer.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/31d1a730c507b605e6c1ebea60eb1e56/flow.svg" alt="Kafka request flow">
<small>
Figure 1: request flow architecture. Core-0 accepts the connection from the Kafka Java client and becomes the source core. After the request goes through the metadata cache(valid request) it filters through the partition router which decides to send the request to core-1, the destination core. Core-1 then accepts the write through the Raft-log interface and saves it to disk.
</small></p>
<p>The challenge in a TpC (thread-per-core) architecture[8] is that all communication between cores is explicit. This muscles the programmer into implementing algorithms that favor core-locality (d-cache, i-cache) over the straightforward multi-threaded implementations via mutexes. This imperative has to be co-designed with the asynchronicity of a <strong>future&lt;&gt;</strong>-based implementation.</p>
<p>For our Kafka-API implementation as shown in Figure 1, we explicitly trade memory usage to reduce latency and increase throughput by materializing key components. The metadata Cache is materialized on every core since every request has to know if the partition exists, and that that particular machine is, in fact, the leader of the partition. The Partition Router maintains a map of which logical core actually owns the underlying Kafka partition on the machine. Other things like Access Control Lists (ACLs) are deferred until the request reaches the destination core since they can get unwieldy in memory footprint.  We have no hard and fast rule of what we materialize on every core vs. what is deferred for the destination core, and it’s often a function of memory (smaller data structures are good candidates for broadcast), computation (how much time is spent deciding) and frequency of access (very likely operations tend to get materialized on every core).</p>
<p>One question remaining is how, exactly, does memory management work in a TpC architecture? How does data actually travel from L-core-0 to L-core-66 safely using a network of SPSC queues within a fully asynchronous execution model where things can suspend at any point in time?</p>
<h2 id="struct-iobuf--">struct iobuf { };<a href="#struct-iobuf--" aria-label="struct iobuf   permalink"></a></h2>
<h3 id="Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC">Redpanda’s 0-copy buffer management for TpC<a href="#Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC" aria-label="Redpandas 0 copy buffer management for TpC permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To understand <strong>iobuf</strong>, we need to understand the actual memory constraints of Seastar, our TpC framework. During program bootstrap, Seastar allocates the full memory of the computer and splits it evenly across all the cores. It consults the hardware to understand what memory belongs to each particular core, reducing inter-core traffic to main memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/efa273909c5b695bf7f978f77b32c12b/seastar_model.svg" alt="Seastar mental model">
<small>
Figure 2: Copy from alexgallego.org (<a href="https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html</a>) Seastar threading model. Seastar uses a network of SPS queues to send messages to neighboring cores. Similar to other message passing or actor models like Erlang, Orleans and Pony, once a function is futurized, transitive functions too will become futurized. Both approaches, however, are intrinsically safe. The programmer worries about correctness and construction while the frameworks worry about efficient execution. Counter to general wisdom, it is actually faster and more scalable than the synchronous approach. While the machine does more work, it is executing your code simultaneously. This simultaneity is the key to finishing work sooner.
</small></p>
<p>As Figure 2 suggests, memory allocated on core-0, <em>must</em> be deallocated on core-0. However, there is no way to guarantee that a Java or Go client connecting to Redpanda will actually communicate with the exact core that owns the data.</p>
<p>At its core, an iobuf is a ref-counted, fragmented-buffer-chain with deferred deletes that allows Redpanda to simply share a view of a remote core’s parsed messages as the fragments come in, without incurring a copy overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/6df6fc00e05201d068dc5d03e080606a/iobuf.svg" alt="iobuf architecture"></p>
<p>The fragmented buffers abstraction is not new. The linux kernel has <strong>sk_buff</strong>[5] and the freebsd kernel has an <strong>mbuf</strong>[6] which are roughly similar. The additional extension of an iobuf is that it works in the TCP model leveraging Seastar’s network of SPSC queues to have proper deletes in addition to being able to share sub-views arbitrarily, tailored for a storage-like workload.</p>
<p>Removing the C++ templates, allocators, pooling, pointer caching, etc, one could think of an iobuf as being equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span> data<span>;</span>
    size_t ref_count<span>;</span>
    size_t capacity<span>;</span>
    size_t size<span>;</span>

    fragment<span>*</span> next<span>;</span>  
    fragment<span>*</span> prev<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>iobuf</span> <span>{</span>
    fragment<span>*</span> head<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The origins of iobuf are rooted in one of our central product tenets for building a Kafka® replacement for mission critical systems - giving users 10x lower tail latencies for most workloads. Aside from a thread-per-core architecture, the memory management would have been our second bottleneck if not designed from the ground up for latency. On long running storage systems, memory fragmentation is a real problem, and one that is eventually either met with a proper solution (iobuf), stalls or an OOM.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors skbuff and mbuff, iobuf allows us to optimize and train our memory allocator with predictable memory sizes. Here is our iobuf allocation table logic:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>io_allocation_size</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> size_t max_chunk_size <span>=</span> <span>128</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>
   <span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> size_t default_chunk_size <span>=</span> <span>512</span><span>;</span>

   <span>static</span> size_t <span>next_allocation_size</span><span>(</span>size_t data_size<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>   </code></pre></div>
<p>Predictability, memory pooling, fixed sizes, size capping, fragmented traversal, etc, are all known techniques to reduce latency. Asking for contiguous and variably sized memory could cause the allocator to compact all of the arenas and reshuffle a lot of bytes for what could be a short-lived request, not only injecting latency on the request path, but for the entire system since we have exactly one thread performing all operations.</p>
<p>Hardware is the platform. When we ask the network layer to give us exactly 11225 bytes in contiguous memory, we are simply asking the allocator to linearize an empty buffer of that exact size and for the network layer to copy bytes as the fragments come from the hardware into the destination buffer. There is ultimately no free lunch when it comes to trying to squeeze every single ounce of performance of your hardware and often it requires re-architecting from zero.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>This week, Red Hat caught a lot of the Linux community off-guard by what was a shocking announcement for many: CentOS 8 as we know it, will see a reduced lifecycle, ending in December 2021. Further, while the project will still support CentOS 7, CentOS, as the community has known it, is effectively a dead project at this point. This is fairly consistent with how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-gobbles-up-red-hat/">IBM</a> is known to do some acquisitions, but it is still shocking.<span id="more-49249"></span></p>
<h2>The Video Version</h2>
<p>Since we have been doing more content with video lately, we are also including a version of this as a video for you to listen to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Hat Says Sayonara to CentOS" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqc3k5Ym1tA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we know most of the folks on here prefer to read, but this video is a fairly close representation of what is in the article. Feel free to open it on YouTube and check it out there.</p>
<h2>CentOS Project Key History</h2>
<p>While some will like to go back to the founding of CentOS, we instead wanted to focus on what CentOS had effectively become over the last 5-10 years: a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) alternative without the support contract.</p>

<p>Even if you run on Debian derivatives, you are aware of how mature the RHEL ecosystem is. It is a testament to Red Hat being the top open-source company in the world. CentOS releases generally lagged the RHEL releases by a few months, but effectively were clones of RHEL for those that did not have the budget for RHEL. Some can say CentOS was something different, but if we are being fair, a huge portion of the usage was effectively to access key parts of the RHEL ecosystem while not paying a subscription fee.</p>
<p>In 2014, Red Hat saw the potential and the benefits to its ecosystem and brought the CentOS team in-house. There is a team inside Red Hat developing CentOS with salaries and badges. The rationale from what I have been told is that it was better to have applications built on CentOS then brought up to RHEL as they matured rather than putting more development effort into the Ubuntu/ Debian ecosystem. That is both simplistic, but also makes a lot of sense. As part of this arrangement, Red Hat effectively got control of the CentOS governing body. That makes a lot of sense since Red Hat would be paying for developers, but it also made a few folks think about what could happen with CentOS not being independent.</p>

<p>Taking a step back to 2014, anyone building applications saw Red Hat’s signal that it was committing resources to CentOS and frankly felt fairly good about platforming on CentOS. We almost switched back our hosting infrastructure to CentOS because of that, but there was a not-insignificant risk that we would get forced into a subscription at some point.</p>
<p>Between that acquisition, and 2020, we had a period where loosely CentOS would follow RHEL releases, supported by official Red Hat resources, by a few months. It took some time to extract bits of IP in RHEL and other changes, but for years, this was the operating model.</p>

<p>Another key factoid is that the end of support for CentOS 6 was in November 2020. Since RHEL and CentOS are known for long support cycles, a lot of organizations decided to jump from CentOS 6 to 8 instead of re-platforming on 7 since that maximizes the time until another re-platforming effort would need to be scheduled. Or that is what many in the industry thought.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49267"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/red-hat-goes-full-ibm-and-says-farewell-to-centos/red-hat-2022/" rel="attachment wp-att-49267"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-scaled.jpg" alt="Red Hat 2022" width="2560" height="1444" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-400x226.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-800x451.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-2048x1155.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-1068x602.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-2022-745x420.jpg 745w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49267">Red Hat Distro Family Progression 2022</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, on December 8, 2020, Red Hat announced that it was going to cut the current CentOS 8 support timeframe down considerably in the process of effectively killing the project. While 2021 may not be impacted, with CentOS 6 EOL on November 30, 2020, and CentOS 8 EOL on December 31, 2021, by January 1, 2022 CentOS 7 will be the only one receiving Maintenance Updates. The CentOS name will live on but in a different part of the ecosystem than it has to date.</p>
<h2>CentOS Stream and the New Red Hat Operating Model</h2>
<p>CentOS Stream is a project that sits between the upstream Fedora Linux and RHEL. While CentOS 8 is being shut down, and we do not expect a CentOS 9 unless there is a major change in direction at Red Hat, the CentOS name will live on for now in the CentOS Stream after CentOS 7 eventually goes EOL on June 30, 2024. By the second half of 2024, and by 2025 we expect this is what the diagram will look like.</p>

<p>For those who are current CentOS users, this means that what will be known as CentOS is being moved upstream of RHEL instead of downstream. Many of the current CentOS users like the fact that it is broadly tied to the RHEL ecosystem, and by moving it upstream it becomes a different value proposition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49272"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/red-hat-goes-full-ibm-and-says-farewell-to-centos/red-hat-summary/" rel="attachment wp-att-49272"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-scaled.jpg" alt="Red Hat Summary" width="2560" height="1436" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-400x224.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-1536x862.jpg 1536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-2048x1149.jpg 2048w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-696x391.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-1068x599.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Red-Hat-Summary-749x420.jpg 749w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49272">Red Hat Distro Family Progression 2020-2025</figcaption></figure>
<p>As much as I have an affinity for the CentOS brand, I do not like “CentOS Stream” being used, especially without CentOS being discontinued as a downstream distribution from RHEL. It made some sense for both to be active, but CentOS Stream may as well be called “BigBlue Hat Enterprise Linux Stream” or something like that. Fedora is not RHEL Stream for a reason. In the future Fedora, CentOS Stream, then RHEL will make sense from a branding perspective, except that CentOS is so widely used that it has a history, a history that will be chronicled for decades in Q&amp;A sites, how-tos, and other user support artifacts from the CentOS (non-stream) era.</p>
<h2>What Red Hat Needs to Do, ASAP</h2>
<p>As part of the announcement, RHEL has hinted that it would be doing something with its RHEL licensing to help the CentOS community, and there is a step it could take to turn this into an amazing gambit for Red Hat: opening a non-subscription level to RHEL beyond the current developer license.</p>
<p>“There are different kinds of CentOS users, and we are working with the CentOS Project Governing Board to tailor programs that meet the needs of these different user groups. In the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce low- or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases, including options for open source projects and communities and expansion of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer subscription use cases to better serve the needs of systems administrators. We’ll share more details as these initiatives coalesce.“ (<strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">Red Hat</a>)</p>
<p>This is the sort of move that could yield huge dividends for Red Hat. If the migration path was from CentOS 8 to a carefully crafted “RHEL-freemium” distribution, which is how many viewed CentOS at a high-level anyway, then it has the ability to greatly increase Red Hat’s installed base in its main RHEL distribution. There are huge ramifications for this from an IP, licensing, and even just a business perspective, but it would be an amazing move. At the same time, it is a move that if Red Hat wanted to do, it should have been announced along with the CentOS retirement to quell the confusion. Effectively, Red Hat would be doing what iXsystems did to migrate FreeNAS to TrueNAS Core just on a much grander scale.</p>
<p>Red Hat desperately needs to have a good path forward. Perhaps none are perfect, but asking CentOS users to upgrade to CentOS Stream, pay for a RHEL license, or leave the ecosystem seems like a highly imperfect set of options.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The intellectually easy answer to what is happening is that IBM is putting pressure on Red Hat to hit bigger numbers in the future. Red Hat sees a captive audience in its CentOS userbase and is looking to covert a percentage to paying customers. Everyone else can go to Ubuntu or elsewhere if they do not want to pay. That seems a bit shortsighted of an explanation we have heard offered.</p>
<figure id="attachment_30704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30704"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-gobbles-up-red-hat/ibm-and-red-hat-merger/" rel="attachment wp-att-30704"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger.jpg" alt="IBM And Red Hat Merger" width="1039" height="572" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger.jpg 1039w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger-400x220.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger-800x440.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger-696x383.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IBM-and-Red-Hat-Merger-763x420.jpg 763w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-30704">IBM And Red Hat Merger</figcaption></figure>
<p>The strange part of the Red Hat announcement was that it sets a precedent that is not great. Both Red Hat, and IBM its parent, are very large, sophisticated companies. There is little chance they did not foresee community outcry over an abrupt change of direction like this. Sometimes, those changes have to be made, and in the technology industry change should be the status quo. At the same time, seeing a large, established company making this kind of abrupt change, that has a major operating impact on a large user base, without a clear path forward, is a scary precedent. RHEL customers are taking notice asking if this is what they can expect from the company moving forward.</p>
<p>There are basically two paths forward here. One is that Red Hat becomes the Apple (or IBM?) of the Linux ecosystem, becoming a high-priced exclusive vendor with great technology. The second is that Red Hat unveils a roadmap that does not leave the CentOS community peering over the edge of an end-of-support cliff.</p>
<p>As always, we would love to hear STH community’s thoughts on the announcement. There is a thread in our <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/centos-8-to-be-discontinued-at-end-of-2021.31052/">forums here</a>.</p>

<p>This past week, GitHub <a href="https://twitter.com/github/status/1336362679506784256" target="_blank">released</a> a long-awaited feature — dark mode. Like many devs around the world, I was hype. In 2020, a dark mode toggle for anything remotely related to tech seems like a requirement.</p>
<p>So I flipped the switch. My immediate reaction was that it seemed a bit off. But I wanted to give it a chance and credited that feeling towards just not being used to the theme yet.</p>
<p>Flash forward a couple of days, I found myself switching to light mode for code review specifically. I didn’t feel confident code reviewing in dark mode. I was scared I would miss something. It was after a couple of instances of this did I realize, GitHub dark mode is <em>too</em> dark. And here’s why.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-and-contrast-ratio"><a href="#accessibility-and-contrast-ratio" aria-label="accessibility and contrast ratio permalink"></a>Accessibility and Contrast Ratio</h3>
<p>I explain contrast ratio in depth <a href="https://blog.karenying.com/posts/boost-visual-accessibility-by-auto-flipping-text-color#wcag-and-contrast-ratio" target="_blank">here</a> but this is what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contrast ratio between two colors mathematically calculates how different our eyes perceive them to be</li>
<li>It ranges between <strong>1</strong> (two of the same colors) to <strong>21</strong> (black and white)</li>
<li>The smaller the text is, the larger the contrast ratio between the text color and the background color needs to be</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG) defines a level <strong>AA</strong> contrast ratio as above <strong>4.5</strong> and level <strong>AAA</strong> as above <strong>7</strong> for small text</li>
<li><strong>AAA</strong> is considered the gold standard level for web accessibility</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-dark-mode-site-palettes"><a href="#other-dark-mode-site-palettes" aria-label="other dark mode site palettes permalink"></a>Other Dark Mode Site Palettes</h3>
<p><em>I did a deep dive into the dark mode palettes of Spotify, Twitter, Facebook and more in this <a href="https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray" target="_blank">post</a>.</em></p>
<p>I grabbed the dark mode colors of a couple of popular sites/apps. Every palette image shows the background color, primary text color, and secondary text color from left to right. <strong>I put the contrast ratios of the primary and secondary colors with the background color on top of the respective color.</strong></p>

<p>Not only do the colors look noticeably darker than their counterparts in other apps, <strong>the secondary text color fails AAA standards</strong>! It’s important for the secondary text color to have high contrast because of how small the font is. I knew my eyes didn’t deceive me.</p>
<p><strong>While contrast ratios aren’t <a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/03/22/orange-you-accessible-mini-case-study-color-ratio/" target="_blank">everything</a>, they are a simple way to quantify the difference between two colors.</strong> In this case, it’s clear that GitHub’s dark mode colors <em>are</em> darker. This can make it harder to read text.</p>
<h3 id="code-review-palette"><a href="#code-review-palette" aria-label="code review palette permalink"></a>Code Review Palette</h3>
<p>Finally, my main gripe with GitHub dark mode is that the red / green for code diffs looks super off to me.</p>
<p>On the right is the light mode colors and left is the new shades. I overlaid the respective background colors on top:</p>

<p>I did calculate the contrast ratios of both palettes and they were pretty similar (close to 1 lol). However, for some reason the lighter one is easier for me to parse at a cursory glance. Maybe I’m not used to it yet, but I really dislike how dark the new diff colors are. For something as important as code review, I’m using GitHub light mode.</p>
<p>I also investigated <strong>VSCode’s Git integration</strong> diff colors (which I enjoy!):</p>

<p>IMO these shades work well even on a darker background and don’t hinder code review.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While there is no color theory justification that GitHub’s new code diff palette is worse, its text colors are not as WCAG accessible as other dark mode apps we use daily.</p>
<p>Maybe if GitHub put as much effort into researching their dark mode palette as they did into the <a href="https://twitter.com/github/status/1336362679506784256" target="_blank">promo video</a> they released, we wouldn’t be here. This is still a beta feature so I have hope. <strong>GitHub, please give us the dark mode experience we deserve 🥺</strong></p>
<p><em>Thanks for reading. Happy hacking!</em></p></div></div>]]>

<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;">If you are learning to code, it is often hard to discover and memorize all programming functions. STJ&nbsp;Python flashcards make it super easy. It combines state of art memory techniques to help you remember functions fast.</p>
<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong>The science behind STJ:&nbsp;Python</strong></p>
<div data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><p>According to research, images help stick the information in the long term memory, transmit messages faster, improve comprehension, trigger emotions, motivate learners. In fact, 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual (<a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/studies-confirm-the-power-of-visuals-in-elearning">source</a>). That is why STJ: Python intriguing and beautiful illustrations can help you memorize faster. Side-by-side with the fantasy setting and funny descriptions STJ:&nbsp;Python cards are a great combo to help boost your memory! They are eye-catching but also cause emotions - the cornerstone of fast memorization (<a href="https://www.memory-key.com/memory/emotion">source</a>).</p><p>Dive into a fantasy world of Summon The JSON, where excellent visual design, creatures, and fun descriptions will help you remember&nbsp;Python function automagically.</p></div>

<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;">STJ:&nbsp;Python is an excellent choice if you:</p>
<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong>Want to become a programmer</strong></p>
<div data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><p>Flashcards contain the most useful set of&nbsp;Python functions programmers use most of the time. STJ:&nbsp;Python will give you a great overview of what tools every programmer has at hand. With that knowledge, it will be easier for you to start thinking about how to create your application from these building blocks.</p><p><strong>Go to a coding job interview</strong></p></div>
<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;">A lot of companies use knowledge tests and whiteboard tasks to assess coding job candidate knowledge. STJ:&nbsp;Python helps you remember functions easier. Regular flashcards are boring and make it hard to stick programming functions to anything meaningful.&nbsp; Contrary STJ:&nbsp;Python helps your brain store information about&nbsp;Python functions in an efficient way.&nbsp; It increases the chance, that during a job interview your brain will be able to give you all information you need.<br></p>

<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><strong>Switch from another language to&nbsp;Python</strong></p>
<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;">If you are already a software developer, you know how confusing it is to switch to learn another language. Some functions are similar. Some are not. It gets even worse when you code in 2 or 3 languages at the same time. There is a lot of things to remember in every language. You need to find equivalents. STJ:&nbsp;Python will help you progress faster in learning Python. It shows you the toolset of the language and helps you remember it faster. Also, if you come back to Python, you can also take a look at cards, to recalibrate your brain easier.</p>

<p data-mce-style="text-align: left;">It is great, we have a lot of easily accessible sources on the Internet, we can find all information within seconds or minutes. But the Internet will never beat the human brain speed. If you remember function names, you will code faster. Moreover, your coding experience will become more fulfilling. You won't worry about connection lags, that the search engine does not give the answer you are looking for. You won't be distracted by websites and online ads. Focus is one of the most important assets of a programmer. STJ:&nbsp;Python will help you be more focused in the zone!</p>

<p>Standing up and managing a service or building a custom service is a common desire for engineers. It’s usually a major mistake, that ends up costing a ton of time and money.
The desire to build custom versions of everything seems to come from a few places:</p>

<ol>
<li>The hope that it will be cheaper to build than buy.</li>
<li>The idea that their companies process is special so industry-standard stuff will not work.</li>
<li>That they need to have total control over what the service does.</li>
<li>To avoid vendor lock-in</li>
</ol>

<p>All four of those things are less true and less important than you would think. It’s worth building when something is core to your business or provides a significant competitive advantage. Otherwise, it’s probably worth using the services that your cloud provider has or another saas. Running your own stuff has a significant operational burden and a large opportunity cost.
If you only get one thing out of this let it be: Building stuff is fun, but being paged at two in the morning about a Rube Goldberg contraption of a system to handle customer analytics isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-running-services-isn-t-easy-p"><p> Running services isn’t easy </p></h2>

<p>Keeping systems up in production takes time and energy. Building them isn’t where most of the expense lies. Instead, that comes with running and maintaining complicated systems.
Most enterprise systems require an engineering team to keep them running. Engineers aren’t cheap to hire and there is also additional complexity that gets introduced to keep a large number of teams coordinated. This all results in slower decision making.</p>

<p>Slower decisions happen because more teams are needed to maintain more services. These teams then need to work together and coordinate. All of a sudden, to make a change there are a million teams that need to be informed and handoffs that have to be managed. That can lead to fiefdoms for managers and way more politics, since there are now more teams and a more complicated organizational structure.</p>

<p>If you are following a DevOps model, the team that builds the service will also end up maintaining it. The more moving pieces that there are for the team to maintain, the less time that they will have for new feature development. This is painful, especially in young companies with a rapidly evolving product. Slowing down the time it takes to find product-market fit in exchange for getting to run your own stuff is a bad trade.</p>

<p>You also have to consider the level of operational excellence that exists in your organization. To put it bluntly, who do you trust more for uptime - Amazon or you? The answer, for services which you absolutely depend on for survival, might be you. Other systems though may suffer from getting less time and attention, because it becomes harder to justify the expense of keeping them up and running.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-vendor-lock-in-p"><p> Vendor lock-in </p></h2>

<p>At this point, you might be thinking “But I don’t want to be stuck on a vendor’s special snowflake of a system”. My counter-argument to that is there is also lock-in with internal systems. The most common version of this is The Keeper of The Spreadsheet. Now, if you’re going “what spreadsheet?”, well that’s a fair question. But it’s the one that for some important internal process that has turned into The Keeper of The Spreadsheet’s job. Most large companies have at least one spreadsheet like this. If you work at a large company, you probably realize that is a gross understatement - there can be many.</p>

<p>The Keeper(s) of The Spreadsheet will defend their process, and not want to change it at all costs, because they are worried that they’ll get fired if that process gets automated or is no longer necessary. You also see this with engineering teams, where they become the Keepers of A Database or ticketing system. All of a sudden you’ve got a system that sucks, and nobody wants to advocate for getting rid of it because their co-worker is convinced that they’ll lose their job if it happens. This also creates a political trap for the unwary when they try and fix that process.</p>

<p>Being The Keeper of The Ticketing System isn’t all that fun usually either. It’s a good way to get pigeonholed into boring work. It also means that you end up with a system that isn’t the most important thing to the business, instead of allowing an outside company to take it. That outside company is likely to specialize in solving that problem, and has built deeper expertise because of that. Unless of course you’re slightly evil and looking for awful projects to exile people to.</p>

<p>All of this makes being locked into a vendor less of a concern than most people think. There is lock-in no matter what you do. The thing that you want to avoid is giving wholesale pricing power to any vendor. This can be avoided by making sure that the key differentiators for your business are in-house.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-engineering-time-is-expensive-p"><p> Engineering time is expensive </p></h2>

<p>Software and systems engineers aren’t cheap to hire. As a group, we also tend to undervalue our time. Think about how often you hear “Oh I could build that in a week”, or “That’ll be easy”. With luck that’s just a comment on Reddit or hacker news, but if it’s at work then it usually turns into a total slog.</p>

<p>It’s common to express the cost of owning or maintaining a service in terms of the total cost of ownership (TCO). This is often really hard to calculate since many of the things that go into TCO aren’t tracked. The major issue that you’ll run into is that it’s not just the cost of the engineer. The metric we care about is the opportunity cost of the other things that engineers could be producing.</p>

<p>Another reason that will come up for building something custom is for unique company processes. Usually with the idea that you couldn’t customize the software to make it work, or that it’d cost more than just building it. While these can be  valid reasons to build, it’s true less often than you would think. Many processes are shared across a large number of businesses. Also, processes tend to get bloated over time. Large amounts of the custom work that is needed to match up with a business’s processes are stuff that could just not be done. For an absurd example, that happened at a company I worked with:
1. Our process for recommending articles is complicated and requires tons of joins on fuzzy data
2. We can build our own database system that is designed specially to handle this.
3. A few months of intense development go by.
4. It turns out operating this thing is hard, we don’t know why some queries take the system down, and why our customers complaining about the recommendations.</p>

<p>You really don’t want that to be you. It’s demoralizing to have built and maintained a product for something that doesn’t even work correctly. When things are getting so complicated that no existing tooling will work for it, you should be asking if all of the complexity is fundamental to the domain or if the model you are using is flawed.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-loss-of-focus-p"><p> Loss of focus </p></h2>

<p>A significant problem that comes from running your own version of a service is that it’s another thing that engineers have to pay attention to. There is a limit on how many things can be important. What then happens to all of the non-core services that you are running is usually some form of neglect, where they are kept in a barely good enough state.</p>

<p>The problem then with that is everyone who is working on those services is usually trying to get off of them. After all, no one wants to work on something that their boss doesn’t care about. So you end up with a ton of maneuvering since people are trying to change teams, and that increases drag.</p>

<p>Compounding this problem even further is that not revenue-generating things are frequently ignored. Yes, your CI/CD system is absolutely critical, but it’s easy for executives to not think about. This leads to a failure mode where you have a lost garden of internal tools. Whereas if you are paying someone money to do the same thing, it is their business so they keep working on it.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-opportunity-cost-p"><p> Opportunity cost </p></h2>

<p>In many ways, the biggest problem with building a service is opportunity cost. The reason isn’t salary but instead what else could be done. It’s basically the same problem that you see when a company is building a one-off feature to close a sale. The big difference is that engineering is doing it to themselves so there may be willful blindness to the damage being done.</p>

<p>Engineers like building things, and many like to be in control of all the buttons and knobs. Many times this is a good thing. After all, it’s how anything super cool actually gets built. The problem with it arises when that impulse exists, without a keen sense of the business effects of decisions that are made.</p>

<p>The question you should be asking is what else could be done instead of tuning your own stuff or building a new internal system. The answer is usually spending more time coming up with the correct architecture,or developing actual customer-facing features, instead of fighting fires .</p>

<p>Having large operational footprints usually results in reduced velocity and fewer changes happening per engineer. Think about the difference in speed between big companies and startups. This isn’t because startups hire smarter people, instead it’s the amount of stuff that is tied up with any change at a big company.</p>

<p>This is an area where engineering can’t just think about the software that is being built. Instead, you have to think of the health of the entire product. It’s about building stuff that is useful for the customer and letting go of things that aren’t critical. By keeping a tight focus on core projects things are built faster. There is also less craft and maintenance work that goes along with the product.</p>

<h2 id="p-align-center-summing-up-p"><p> Summing up </p></h2>

<p>None of these reasons might apply in your case. There are many good reasons to build. However, if you haven’t considered whether you can just buy something to solve a problem instead of building it yourself, you should.</p>

<p>Think about if it’s worth as being paged at 2 in the morning over. If you are willing to be paged over it, also consider if someone else can …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank">Semgrep</a> is an emerging
static analysis tool which is getting traction within the AppSec
community. Its broad support to multiple programming languages, together with
the easiness with which is possible to create rules, makes it a
powerful tool that can help AppSec teams scaling their efforts into preventing
complete classes of vulnerabilities from their codebases.</p>
<p>But what about cloud security? In the era of Infrastructure as Code,
where tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi (and many others) are used
to provision infrastructure from (de-facto) source code, can we apply the
same approach to eradicate classes of cloud-related vulnerabilities from a
codebase?</p>

<p>I decided to spend part of my weekend experimenting with this,
and to get an idea of what Semgrep can provide to cloud/platform security teams.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the details, it is worth explaining what Semgrep
actually is.
As per their <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep" target="_blank">website</a>, Semgrep is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fast, open-source, static analysis tool that excels at expressing code standards — without complicated queries — and surfacing bugs early at editor, commit, and CI time.</p>
<p>Precise rules look like the code you’re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling with regexes.</p>
<p>The Semgrep Registry has 1,000+ rules written by the Semgrep community covering security, correctness, and performance bugs. No need to DIY unless you want to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a high level, Semgrep leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
to build a model of the code you are analyzing. Unlike other tools based on ASTs,
though, Semgrep lowers the entry bar by abstracting away the AST syntax itself.</p>

</figure>
<p>Out of the box, Semgrep supports mainstream programming languages
(e.g., Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript, etc.) and has a library of
<a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules" target="_blank">open source rules</a>
ready to be re-used.</p>
<p>Explaining how to use Semgrep is out of scope for this blog post,
but the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/" target="_blank">official documentation</a>
is really well made, and the
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor" target="_blank">online playground</a>
is an excellent space where to start playing with it
(without having to spend time installing anything).</p>
<hr>

<p>As briefly mentioned earlier, the benefit that Semgrep can bring to AppSec teams
is obvious (and if you are still not convinced, I recommend you to watch this
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j9uqQsMlePEuSzOD6E4Th2IYY4Hi7dl5XYbHdSDMkrc/" target="_blank">this presentation</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/clintgibler/" target="_blank">Clint Gibler</a>).</p>
<p>What I was curious to try was how well the same approach could fit a codebase
made of Terraform (HCL) and YAML files, as those languages are not currently
supported by Semgrep. Hence, I relied on its <code>Generic Pattern Matching</code> engine.</p>
<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>The official <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/tree/develop/terraform/lang/security" target="_blank">semgrep-rules</a> repository already contains a folder dedicated to Terraform.</p>
<figure>

</a>
<figcaption>Open source Terraform rules.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Within this folder, we can see 7 rules already made open source, mainly focusing
on <a href="https://github.com/bridgecrewio/terragoat" target="_blank">Terragoat</a>
scenarios and S3 buckets.</p>
<h3 id="unencrypted-ebs-volumes">Unencrypted EBS Volumes</h3>
<p>Let’s start wrapping our head around it by picking the <code>unencrypted-ebs-volume</code> rule.
In the repo we can see a sample <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/blob/develop/terraform/lang/security/ebs-unencrypted-volume.tf" target="_blank">Terraform file</a> (shown here below):</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="terraform"><span>resource</span> <span>"aws_ebs_volume"</span> <span>"web_host_storage"</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>availability_zone</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ap-southeast-2"</span>
  <span>encrypted</span>         <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
  <span>size</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span># ruleid: unencrypted-ebs-volume</span>
  <span>tags</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"abcd-ebs"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Quite straightforward, with an <code>aws_ebs_volume</code> resource declaring an EBS volume
with encryption disabled (as it can bee seen from <code>encrypted = false</code>).</p>
<p>So what we want to <code>grep</code> here is for an occurrence of <code>encrypted = false</code>
(or the lack of <code>encrypted = true</code>), as shown in the
<a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/blob/develop/terraform/lang/security/ebs-unencrypted-volume.yaml" target="_blank">corresponding rule</a>:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>rules</span><span>:</span>
<span>-</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>unencrypted-ebs-volume</span>
  <span>patterns</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>pattern-either</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
          <span>{...}</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>pattern-not-inside</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
        <span>resource "aws_ebs_volume" "..." {... encrypted=true ...}</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>pattern-inside</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
        <span>resource "aws_ebs_volume" "..." {...}</span>
  <span>languages</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>generic</span>
  <span>paths</span><span>:</span>
    <span>include</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>'</span><span>*.tf'</span>
  <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
    <span>An EBS volume is configured without encryption enabled.</span>
  <span>severity</span><span>:</span> <span>WARNING</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can try this rule in the Semgrep playground:
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/s/ZWrA/" target="_blank">https://semgrep.dev/s/ZWrA/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="open-security-groups">Open Security Groups</h3>
<p>As a second test, I wanted to create my first Semgrep rule to detect
a Security Group open to the world (<code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), like the one below:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="terraform"><span>resource</span> <span>"aws_security_group"</span> <span>"allow_tls"</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>name</span>        <span>=</span> <span>"allow_tls"</span>
  <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Allow TLS inbound traffic"</span>
  <span>vpc_id</span>      <span>=</span> <span>aws_vpc</span><span>.</span><span>main</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>

  <span>ingress</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"TLS from VPC"</span>
    <span>from_port</span>   <span>=</span> <span>443</span>
    <span>to_port</span>     <span>=</span> <span>443</span>
    <span>protocol</span>    <span>=</span> <span>"tcp"</span>
    <span>cidr_blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"10.0.1.0/24"</span><span>,</span> <span>"0.0.0.0/0"</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>tags</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"allow_tls"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>What we want to <code>grep</code> here is any occurrence of <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> within an <code>ingress</code> block:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>rules</span><span>:</span>
<span>-</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>open-security-group</span>
  <span>patterns</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>pattern-inside</span><span>:</span> <span>ingress { ... }</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>0.0.0.0/0"</span>
  <span>languages</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>generic</span>
  <span>paths</span><span>:</span>
    <span>include</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>'</span><span>*.tf'</span>
  <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
    <span>A security group is allowing inbound traffic from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0).</span>
  <span>severity</span><span>:</span> <span>WARNING</span></code></pre></figure>

<figcaption>open-security-group rule.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can try this rule in the Semgrep playground:
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/s/ne51/" target="_blank">https://semgrep.dev/s/ne51/</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this is a vary basic case, where the offending string (<code>0.0.0.0/0</code>)
is directly hardcoded within the security group definition. The rule
will have to be extended if we want to take into account cases where
the CIDR can be specified, for example, via variables.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Next, I wanted to create a rule more focused on Kubernetes (or, more precisely, YAML files).</p>
<p>Let’s take as a sample the case where you might want to enforce all your
Kubernetes Ingresses to be private, removing all the <code>public</code> ones:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>extensions/v1beta1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Ingress</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>test-ingress</span>
  <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
    <span>kubernetes.io/ingress.class</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>rules</span><span>:</span>

<p>You can try this rule in the Semgrep playground:

<hr>

<p>I have to say the extensibility, and simple syntax, of Semgrep are making it
very promising for cloud security teams as well.
In a few hours, thanks to the official documentation and Playground, I was able
to go from absolute 0 to writing my first rules.</p>
<p>The main challenge I can think of at the moment is: how much does Semgrep
overlap with <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest" target="_blank">OPA Conftest</a>?
Although Conftest has been created with cloud resources in mind,
and benefits from the sinergies
with the rest of the OPA offering (like <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper" target="_blank">Gatekeeper</a>), basically everyone in the
industry at some point complained about how cumbersome the <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/" target="_blank">Rego</a> language is.
In my opinion, this could be a defining factor that might help expand the adotpion
of Semgrep from platform teams.</p>
<p>I’m quite curious to hear other people’s opinions on this, so please

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The regex literals optimization avoids running the regex engine on parts of the input text that cannot possibly ever match the regex.</p>

<p>An example of a regex this can be applied to is <code>\w+@\w+\.\w+</code>, where the algorithm <em>quickly</em> finds the first <code>@</code>, then matches <code>\w+</code> backwards to find the start of the match, and then matches <code>\w+\.\w+</code> forward to find the end of the match. It then finds the second <code>@</code>, starting from the end of the previous match, and so on. This is a fairly naive (and incorrect) implementation, but it gives the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve recently implemented it in my pet project <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/pull/68">nim-regex</a>, an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time. The results show it’s around ~100x faster than before in some benchmarks. It’s up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in. The tests are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with <em>Chivers’ String Prefix Optimization</em>.</p>

<h2 id="literals-optimization">Literals Optimization</h2>

<p>Since nim-regex has to guarantee linear time, I’ll describe optimizations that are guaranteed to take linear time. We must also ensure the matches are not overlapped.</p>

<p>Here’s a high-level description of the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We pick a literal that is <code>memchr</code>‘ed to skip parts of the text.</li>
  <li>The prefix is the regex part before the literal; none of the
characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal.</li>
  <li>The prefix is ran backwards to find the start of the match.</li>
  <li>A full scan is ran from the start of the match
until a character that cannot be matched is found (safe break point)
or the end is reached. The scan tries to start the match at every character (NFAs can do this in linear time).</li>
  <li>Go to step one and repeat from the last scanned char. Make the prefix
match until the previous last scanned char.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important constraints to picking a literal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“none of the characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal”</em>, why? consider the regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and the input text: <code>xxxxxxxxxxx</code>; this would take quadratic time, as the prefix will match until the start of the string every time. What about the limit? while the limit does avoid the excessive matching, sometimes we’d need to match past the limit, ex: regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and text: <code>1xxx</code>. If we add this constraint, the literal becomes a delimeter, and these cases are solved.</li>
  <li>The literal cannot be part of a repetition, nor it can be part of an alternation. For example: <code>(abc)*def</code> the first literal candidate is <code>d</code>, since <code>(abc)*</code> may or may not be part of the match. Same thing for alternations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the main algorithm in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>func</span> <span>findAll</span><span>(</span>
  <span>matches</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>Matches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span>

    <span>limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>  <span># rather pointless since the literal is a delimiter</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>memchr</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>.</span><span>lit</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>litIdx</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>matchPrefix</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>limit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>litIdx</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>findSome</span><span>(</span><span>matches</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>matches</span><span>.</span><span>len</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>i</span>  <span># this is used as "start" to resume the matching</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A given character may be consumed only twice, once by the backward prefix match, and a second time by the forward scan. Hence the algorithm runs in linear time.</p>

<p>I may describe how <code>matchPrefix</code> and <code>findSome</code> work, how to construct the reversed NFA in the right order, and how to pick the literal in a future article. The nim-regex code contains descriptions of the algorithms, though.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/tree/master/bench">benchmarks</a> regexes are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>. The only difference is the regexes are pre-compiled, so just the matching is tested. The results show nim-regex is ~63x faster than PCRE in the email test, and ~2x faster in the URI and IP tests.</p>

<p>Why is nim-regex so fast in the email case? The regex engine doesn’t run as often. There are orders of magnitud more IP/URI candidates than email candidates (<code>@</code> chars within the text) to match. In the former case the time is dominated by the regex engine, while in the latter case it’s dominated by searching the char literal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note Nim’s PCRE is at the top of the mariomka/regex-benchmark. I ran those benchmarks, and IIRC nim-regex was just a bit faster, mainly because the non-macro regex engine is slower (see the above results), and the regex compilation is also tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-optimizations">Other optimizations</h2>

<p>Here are other possible optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a literal —even if the prefix matches it— should take linear time as long as the prefix is bounded (i.e: does not contain repetitions), ex: <code>\d\wx</code>.</li>
  <li>Picking a literal within a “one or more” repetition/repetition group should be possible, since <code>(abc)+</code> matches the same as <code>abc(abc)*</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s better to pick the last literal within the first literal sequence, since that way we always try to match as many literals as possible early on, and potentially fail early. We want to keep the prefix regex as short as possible, so the picking a literal in the first sequence is best.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized this very same way in some cases, ex: <code>bar|baz</code>, since both alternations have <code>ba</code> in common, <code>a</code> can be picked as the literal.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized in other cases. PCRE seems to use <code>memchr</code> or similar for up to two alternation terms. A DFA could be used to quickly match candidates instead of <code>memchr</code>, as that’s a more general solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Literals optimization is not a general optimization as it does not work on every regex, but when it does, it can greatly improve the matching speed.</p>

<p>Can a backtracker like PCRE implement this? PCRE in particular already has some sort of similar optimization, but it’s not as good/fast as this one. Backtrackers cannot implement this as described here exactly, but they can do something similar that requires backtracking. If they provide a resumable <code>find</code> function, then probably yes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more regex engines will implement these sort of optimizations, so they are more compelling alternatives to backtrackers such as PCRE.</p>

<p>While listening to a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/12/02/bgp-with-andree-toonk/">podcast discussing BGP</a> I heard the fact that AWS owns more than $2B worth of IP addresses. I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a <a href="https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/">site</a> that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size. Now it was time to figure out the IP addresses owned by Amazon. I figured this would be difficult but lucky for us AWS actually <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">publishes</a> their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.</p>

<p>The work is simply to download the JSON and then convert the CIDR blocks to the number of IPs and add them all up. As of today, December 11, 2020 AWS self reports owning 109,847,486 IPV4 addresses - at a price of $20 this is almost $2.2B and at $30 it’s almost $3.3B. That’s wild.</p>

<p><teaser><br>The <strong>TP-Link HS110 Wi-Fi</strong> is a cloud-enabled power plug that can be turned on and off remotely via app and offers energy monitoring and scheduling capabilities. As part of ongoing research into Internet of Things security, we performed a security analysis by reverse engineering the device firmware and Android app, sniffing app-to-device and device-to-app communications and <a href="https://www.softscheck.com/de/fuzzing-de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fuzzing</a> the proprietary protocols being used.</teaser></p>
<p>While cloud communication was found to be reasonably secure for an IoT device, we discovered two insecure proprietary local configuration protocols: A human-readable JSON protocol “encrypted” with an easily reversible autokey XOR cipher and a binary DES-encrypted configuration and debugging protocol (<strong>TDDP – TP-Link Device Debug Protocol</strong>). TDDP is in use across most of the TP-Link product line including routers and access points and thus merits further research. We also release a <a href="https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wireshark dissector and two python clients</a> for the proprietary protocols on GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud functionality can be turned off</li>
<li>Cloud communication uses HTTPS and CA pinning</li>
<li>Stores energy monitoring data locally</li>
<li>Firmware update checks signature against RSA keys</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Useless encryption for local communication</li>
<li>No authentication: Anybody on the local network can turn the Smart Plug on and off, reset it or render it inoperable</li>
<li>TLS cloud connection could be intercepted with any valid Symantec EV certificate (only Root CA is checked)</li>
<li>Phones home even if set up as local-only</li>
<li>Undocumented configuration and debug service (TDDP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong id="Device Setup">2. Device Setup</strong> <a href="#nav"></a></p>
<p>The Smart Plug has two physical buttons: An on/off relay switch and a device reset button that resets the device if pushed for five seconds or longer. When plugged in, an unconfigured or freshly reset Smart Plug will start an unsecured open Access Point with the SSID “<code>TP-LINK_Smart Plug_XXXX</code>” where XXXX are four hexadecimal numbers. A quick search on <a href="https://www.wigle.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WiGLE</a> reveals several unconfigured TP-Link Smart Plugs in the wild:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/wigle-suche-1.png" alt="wigle-suche"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
TP-Link’s Smart Home app “<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.kasa_android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasa</a>” makes the smartphone connect to this access point, sends UDP broadcast packets to <code>255.255.255.255</code> to find the Smart Plug IP and proceeds to configure it with the SSID and password that the user entered into the app. The Smart Plug then turns off the Access Point and connects to the configured WiFi as a client.</p>
<p>We perform a KARMA attack using the Sensepost <a href="https://github.com/sensepost/mana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MANA Toolkit</a>, forcibly deauthenticating the Smart Plug and trying to get it to connect to a rogue Access Point with the same SSID and no security. The attack is not successful; however repeated deauthentication can be used to perform a temporary Denial of Service attack against the device.</p>
<p><strong id="Reverse Engineering the firmware">3. Reverse Engineering the TP-Link HS110 firmware</strong> <a href="#nav"></a></p>
<p>We download the current official firmware for the device (<code>HS110(US)_V1_151016.zip</code>) and use binwalk to extract the contents of the .bin file:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/binwalk-1.png" alt="binwalk"></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As we can see, the firmware is a typical embedded Linux system and contains three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>U-Boot Bootloader 1.1.4 (Oct 16 2015 – 11:22:22)</li>
<li>Linux Kernel 2.6.31—LSDK-9.2.0_U11.14 (yt@yangtao.localdomain)</li>
<li>Squashfs filesystem</li>
</ul>
<p>Examining the contents of the filesystem, we find the following interesting files:</p>
<ul>
<li>/bin/busybox v1.01 (2015.10.16-03:17+0000)</li>
<li>/etc/newroot2048.crt</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the certificate used to verify the identity of the cloud server. The file contains the “<a href="https://www.symantec.com/theme/roots">VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5</a>” root certificate. This means the only check performed when establishing a TLS connection to the cloud is if the provided server certificate has been signed by the Symantec/VeriSign CA for Extended Validation (EV) certificates (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CA pinning</a>). A determined attacker could buy his own EV certificate and use it to impersonate a cloud server.</p>
<ul>
<li>/etc/shadow</li>
</ul>
<pre>root:7KBNXuMnKTx6g:15502:0:99999:7:::</pre>
<p>The oldschool descrypt password is trivially broken, the password is “media”.</p>
<ul>
<li>/usr/bin/shd – the main server application</li>
<li>/usr/bin/shdTester – client for energy monitor calibration</li>
<li>/usr/bin/calDump – dumps wifi calibration data from /dev/caldata</li>
</ul>
<p>All proprietary server logic is contained in the shd (“Smart Home Daemon”) binary, which is <code>MIPS32 R2 Big Endian</code>:</p>
<pre>shd: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), 
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, corrupted section header size
</pre>
<p>The shd binary also contains a copy of <code>OpenSSL 1.0.1j 15 Oct 2014</code> for establishing TLS connections to the cloud server.<br>
We load the shd binary into IDA and start analyzing!</p>
<p><strong id="Busybox">4. Busybox</strong> <a href="#nav"></a></p>
<p>The Busybox version provided in the firmware is vulnerable to <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2011-2716</a>, a command injection vulnerability in the udhcpc DHCP client component of Busybox, which allows to inject shell commands into one of the following DHCP options: (12) Hostname, (15) Domainname, (40) NIS Domain or (66) TFTP Server Name. For this to work, those values have to be actually used by the shell script invoking udhcpc. Analyzing the firmware we find that the shd binary creates a shell script <code>/tmp/udhcpc.script</code> containing:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
if[ $1 = renew –o $1 = bound]
then
    ifconfig $interface $ip netmask $subnet
    route del default
    route add default gw $router
   echo "nameserver $dns" &gt; /tmp/resolv.conf
fi
</pre>
<p>It then executes udhcpc:</p>
<pre>/sbin/udhcpc –b –H "HS100(US)" –i br0 –s /tmp/udhcpc.script
</pre>
<p>As we can see, the hostname is hardcoded and none of the other options are used. Unfortunately, the udhcpc vulnerability is not exploitable in this case.</p>
<p><strong id="Portscan">5. Portscan</strong> <a href="#nav"></a></p>
<p>An nmap port scan on all TCP and UDP ports reveals the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Port</strong></th>
<th><strong>Protocol</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>80/tcp</td>
<td>HTTP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9999/tcp</td>
<td>TP-Link Smart Home Protocol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1040/udp</td>
<td>TP-Link Device Debug Protocol (TDDP)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Webserver on Port <code>80</code> replies with a meaningless ellipsis, no matter what the request is:</p>
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: TP-LINK Smart Plug
Connection: close
Content-Length: 5
Content-Type: text/html

…
</pre>
<p>Looking through the shd binary we see that the HTTP Server routine is called “<code>fake_httpd</code>” and will always return this hardcoded reply.</p>
<p>Port <code>9999 TCP</code> is used for controlling the Smart Plug on the local network via the Kasa app and is described in the <a href="#TP-Link Smart Home Protocol">TP-Link Smart Home Protocol section</a>. Port <code>1040 UDP</code> is described in the <a href="#TP-Link Device Debug Protocol">TP-Link Device Debug Protocol section</a>.</p>
<p><strong id="TP-Link Smart Home Protocol">6. TP-Link Smart Home Protocol</strong> <a href="#nav"></a></p>
<p>Sniffing the local wireless network traffic reveals that the TP-Link Kasa SmartHome app talks to the HS110 Smart Plug on TCP port 9999 using what looks like encrypted data.</p>
<p>After decompiling the Kasa app for Android, we find the encryption function:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/tphome-encryption-1.png" alt="hs110 tphome-encryption"></p>
<p>We see the initial key (initialization vector) i has a hardcoded value of <code>-85 (= 171)</code>. The first byte of the plaintext is <code>XORed</code> with the key. The key is then set to the plaintext byte. During the next iteration, the next plaintext byte is <code>XORed</code> with the previous plaintext byte. Decryption works the same, with the keystream made out of cyphertext bytes. This is known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autokey cipher</a> and while it has better statistical properties than simple XOR encryption with a repeating key, it can be easily broken by known plaintext attacks.</p>
<p>Now that we know the algorithm and the key, we implement a Wireshark dissector in LUA which automatically decrypts TP-Link Smart Home packets on port <code>9999</code>. It turns out that the protocol uses JSON, so we also pass the decrypted contents to the JSON dissector. We can now monitor communications between the Kasa app and the Smart Plug on the local WiFi:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/wireshark-dissector-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/wireshark-dissector-1.png" alt="wireshark-dissector"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The Smart Plug commands are grouped into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>system</li>
<li>netif (WLAN interface commands)</li>
<li>cnCloud (cloud connection)</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>emeter (energy meter)</li>
<li>schedule (scheduled on/off)</li>
<li>count_down (countdown on/off)</li>
<li>anti_theft (random scheduled on/off)</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide a comprehensive list of JSON commands (<a href="https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug/blob/master/tplink-smarthome-commands.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tplink-smarthome-commands.txt</a>) and a python client to send them with (<a href="https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug/blob/master/tplink_smartplug.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tplink_smartplug.py</a>).</p>
<p><strong>System Commands</strong></p>
<p>We can read out information about the system using the <code>get_sysinfo</code> command:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"get_sysinfo":{}}}</pre>
<p>To send the command using our python client, invoke it with the <code>–c</code> info option:</p>
<pre>./tplink_smartplug.py –t 192.168.0.1 –c info</pre>
<p>We provide several predefined commands to read out information from the HS110 Smart Plug using <code>–c</code> options.<br>
Alternatively, you can use the <code>–j</code> option and provide the full JSON string:</p>
<pre>./tplink_smartplug.py –t 192.168.0.1 –j '{"system":{"get_sysinfo":{}}}'</pre>
<p>This allows to send any of the commands listed in <code>tplink-smarthome-commands.txt</code>.<br>
The <code>get_sysinfo</code> reply will contain the following information:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/sysinfo.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.softscheck.com/assets/img/blog/sysinfo.png" alt="hs110 sysinfo"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
We can turn the HS110 Smart Plug on and off using the <code>set_relay_state</code> command, using <code>1</code> for on and <code>0</code> for off:</p>
<pre>{“system":{"set_relay_state":{"state":1}}}</pre>
<p>We can reboot the HS110 Smart Plug using the <code>reboot</code> command which requires a <code>delay</code> parameter in seconds:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"reboot":{"delay":1}}}</pre>
<p>The HS110 Smart Plug can be reset to factory settings, making it act as an open Access Point again:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"reset":{"delay":1}}}</pre>
<p>Note that since the protocol does not provide authentication, anybody on your network can send this command and force a reset. Here, a prankster would set a high delay value, giving them time to leave the premises.</p>
<p>There are further commands to change the MAC address, change the Device and Hardware IDs, turn off the device LED (night mode) etc.</p>
<p>Of special interest are the firmware flashing commands. You can download a&nbsp; firmware file from an arbitrary URL using:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"download_firmware":{"url":"http://..."}}}</pre>
<p>While downloading, you can get the download state using:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"get_download_state":{}}}</pre>
<p>Once the download is finished, you can flash the firmware using:</p>
<pre>{"system":{"flash_firmware":{}}}</pre>
<p>Flashing a modified image will not work since the image’s signature has to match one of four hardcoded RSA keys (we won’t go into wild speculations why there are four keys here):</p>

	<div>
	  <p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot</a> is a low-cost robot kit for students, software engineers, makers to learn <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/">ROS2</a> and robotics in a hands-on manner. Our robot kits are easy to build, extensible, and customizable. The Hadabot software stack consists of an open source web browser-based coding environment to make the hacking experience frustration-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot ROS2 "Turtle" robot kits are available for purchase</a>!</p>
<hr>
<p>In a previous post, we showcased the <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/">ROS 2 turtlesim</a> running with the <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/">Navigation2 (aka Nav2)</a> package. That exercise required the use of the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a> which manages all <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/ros2-navigation-tf2-tutorial-using-turtlesim.html#what-is-tf2">the various coordinate frames of a robotics application</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, instead of turtlesim, we'll have Nav2 direct a physical Hadabot Turtle differential drive robot to a goal pose - position and orientation. This exercise will bring together rviz, tf2, Nav2 with our past writeups about the <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/implement-ros2-odometry-using-vscode-in-web-browser.html">Turtle robot's odometry and kinematics</a>. We'll touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How we compute odometry for Nav2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nav2 parameters we tweaked</p>
</li>

<h3>1. ROS 2 Nav2 with a Hadabot Turtle robot</h3>
<p>As with all Hadabot examples, you can use the Hadabot stacks browser-based VSCode to compile and run the code.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up / update your turn-key Hadabot software stack (which leverages Docker containers to ensure your code runs securely and efficiently on your local machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>you are new to Hadabot</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/new-user-software-stack-setup.html" target="_blank">steps to set up Docker and get the Hadabot software stack up and running</a> (5 to 15 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else if you are a <strong>returning Hadabot hacker</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/software-stack-update.html" target="_blank">steps to update your Hadabot software stack</a> (1-3 minutes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://localhost:9123/?folder=/home/hadabot/hadabot_main/content/p9" target="_blank">Launch the browser-based VSCode workspace specific to this post</a> (this link points to your localhost so everything is running securely on your local system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left VSCode Explorer panel, right-click the <strong>README.md</strong> file -&gt; Open Preview.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Update your ROS 2 packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flash the example's ESP32 firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle robot controller and coordinate frame code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch a browser-based VNC client to run the example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a go-to-goal Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

        </p>

<h5>Rviz to visualize the Nav2 go-to-goal Hadabot Turtle example</h5>
<p>If you successfully ran the example, you'll notice that the Turtle starts in the middle of the "arena" (ie map). Each grid-box represents 1 meter in physical distance. The red-axis presents the Turtle pointed forward. Since ROS uses a right-handed coordinate system, positive <span>\(\omega\)</span> rotation results in the Turtle turning counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>For the video example, the goal pose was 1 meter to the Turtle's left, with a 90 degree orientation from its initial orientation. </p>
<p>Notice the Turtle didn't end up exactly 1 meter to its left, nor was it oriented exactly 90 degrees from its initial pose. This is due to 2 reasons due to nothing happening exactly in the real world (this is not a simulation anymore Dorothy) - (1) the Hadabot Turtle's speed sensors have errors which accumulates over time resulting in odometry drift, and (2) Nav2 goal checker allows for a tolerance in both distance and orientation from the specificed end-goal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. How we construct TF2 messages from odometry</h3>
<p>The Hadabot Turtle publishes each wheel's rotational velocity in radians per second. With the measured wheelbase and wheel radius of the Turtle, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead-reckoning</a> to determine how far each wheel has traveled in meters.</p>
<p>Once we know how far each wheel has traveled for our differential drive model, we can compute the linear distance and angular rotation <span>\((v, \omega)\)</span> for a unicycle model, which allows us to update the current pose and velocities of our Hadabot Turtle as an <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html">Odometry ROS message</a>. All this is done in the <em>hadabot_controller.cpp</em> file.</p>
<p>Then we use effectively the same code as the turtlesim example to extract the pose information from the Odometry message and publish that out as tf2 messages which is used by Nav2 and rviz.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Setting up Nav2 for the Hadabot Turtle</h3>
<p>Nav2 is a complex ROS 2 package with a number of sub-packages / components around 3 main capabilities - localization, planning/controller, and mapping. For our go-to-goal example, we mainly use the planning/controller component.</p>
<p>There are conceptually 2 types of planners in Nav2 - a global planner, and a local planner. The global planner computes a global trajectoy to get to our goal pose. The local planner references the global plan to determine the best linear and angular velocity for the robot to undertake to safely move along the global trajectory. </p>
<p>The global planner (as of 2020-12) defaults to a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> based planner. The local planner is called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/236487972">DWB planner, initially created by David Lu back in the ROS 1 days</a>, which implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm</a> created by Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun. The DWB planner is driven by "critics" which vote on various local trajectories to undertake. Each critic "cares" about a certain behavior (ie avoiding abstacles, avoiding oscillation, going fast, etc). The local trajectory with the highest vote wins and that results as the Twist message command to direct the robot's current velocities.</p>
<p>Configuring Nav2 for our go-to-goal example involved tuning the parameters for the planning/controller. The ones we tweaked for the Hadabot Turtle are the max velocities of our robot, and controller update frequency (to update frequently enough but not so much that it floods our "hobbyist" network capabilities). There are many other <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/index.html">Nav2 parameters we can consider and tune</a>, which can be a series of posts and exercises on its own. </p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this post, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Showed a example of running a physical real-life Hadabot Turtle robot using ROS 2 Nav2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We described how we use dead-reckoning to compute the Turtle's pose and velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked a bit about Nav2 and what we tweaked to get our goal-to-goal example to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In future posts, we can take this exercise down 2 separate threads - (1) to walk through some of the Nav2 parameters in more detail, start looking closer at Nav2, or (2) to showcase a Hadabot Turtle with a skirt of range-sensors (add-on for the base Turtle kit) to further explore localization and then SLAM with Nav2.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with various professors to create a more structured ROS 2 robotics syllabus and curriculum.</p>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy, intended to illustrate in the simplest possible way how specialization gets punished when transfers are taxed in proportion to their values. The current reality not <em>nearly</em> this bad due to many complex exemptions, as I discuss at the end. But the flaw described <em>does</em> exist and <em>does</em> punish specialization. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WHERE THE SAME UNIT OF VALUE IS TAXED MULTIPLE TIMES PLEASE READ THIS LINK.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>

      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>

<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

</table>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/vat.jpg" alt="vat"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Price after tax</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconut</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2.4</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3.40</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4.60</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5.80</td>
      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initial map is based on Wikipedia, but found that many places (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/thailand/corporate/other-taxes">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/05/tnf-saudi-arabia-vat-rate-to-increase-to-15-percent-covid-19.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran#Value_added_tax_(VAT)">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/om/en/pages/tax/articles/oman-to-implement-vat-from-2021.html">Oman</a>, <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/valueaddedtaxvat">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-economy-tax-idUSKCN1IG0OW">Kuwait</a>, <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-early-days-for-angola-value-added-tax">Angola</a>, <a href="https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/liberia-to-introduce-vat-2019.html">Liberia</a>) have recently implemented VAT. I checked that most of the others (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jordan/corporate/other-taxes">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/france/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/7685.aspx?lang=eng#valuetax">French Guinana</a>, <a href="https://www.nordeatrade.com/en/explore-new-market/cuba/taxes">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/libya/individual/other-taxes">Libya</a>, Hong Hong) still do not have a VAT.</li>
  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">YES</a>.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

    <p><a href="https://ssb.fit/"><em>Smash Training</em></a> is a spaced-repetition training web-app I created to help my progression with <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. I released it on May 16, 2020 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gkybpe/trying_to_get_into_elite_smash_this_quarantine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a> to warm reception. As of December 2020, it receives 150-200 monthly users. I’d rank it as my most successful project!</p>

<p>In this article, I discuss the choices I made for this project. The source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining">https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining</a>.</p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project requirements</h2>

<p>I decided that I wanted to build a spaced-repetition training app, rather than reuse a general-purpose spaced-repetition flash-card system such as Anki, because the project would benefit from domain-specific knowledge. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercises have large numbers of variants, such as “short-hop” vs “full-hop”, or “facing left” vs “facing right”, which should be tracked separately.</li>
  <li>Many of the exercises have natural dependencies on others: they shouldn’t be attempted unless a certain underlying fundamental skill has been mastered.</li>
  <li>Exercises to train one character don’t necessarily confer the same skill for other characters. Some exercises may only be applicable to some characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to make an app to automate the spaced repetition regimen I was attempting to follow by hand, which I could then share with others.</p>

<p>Here were my engineering requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should be mobile-first, but preferably also available on desktop.</li>
  <li>Should be local-first, or at least not require creating an account to use.</li>
  <li>Should be architected to support sync between devices, although the sync itself was not a requirement for the first iteration.</li>
  <li>Should have approximately zero hosting costs.</li>
  <li>Should be hosted on of a stable platform which doesn’t require monitoring (e.g. not my home computer).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain name</h2>

<p>I wanted to choose between a permutation like the following for the domain name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smashtraining.com</li>
  <li>ssbtraining.com</li>
  <li>smash.training</li>
  <li>ssb.training</li>
  <li>smash.fit</li>
  <li>ssb.fit</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I used <code>ssb.fit</code> because 1) <code>smash.training</code> got taken (!) and 2) I wanted to optimize for typing it in on a mobile device, even though the name is less memorable. This lack of memorability unfortunately manifested in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gp9sem/wtf_was_that_smash_training_website_called/frkscwe/?context=3">this Reddit thread titled “WTF was that smash training website called?”</a>. However, another commenter writes “ssb.fit is better, short for mobile”, perhaps vindicating the original choice.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that the domain name and the website title don’t exactly match up. Many people seemed to address it as “ssb.fit” hence, so maybe that’s what the project should have been called too (rather than “Smash Training”).</p>

<h2 id="user-studies-and-ui">User studies and UI</h2>

<p>I conducted several user studies with friends and family, including some people who had played Smash before and some who hadn’t.</p>

<h3 id="ui">UI</h3>

<p>The first main thing I iterated on was the design of the exercise tracker widget. I originally based it off of the <em>Stronglifts</em> app:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png" alt="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app." title="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p><em>Stronglifts</em> has you note down how many repetitions of the exercise you succeeded at (out of five). However, the <em>Smash Training</em> paradigm is different, and has you repeat the exercise for a length of time and rate your accuracy.</p>

<p>I experimented with a “smiley-face” UI rather than a rep-count UI, as in Stronglifts, along with a few other options. After a lot of feedback from friends, I arrived at a slider-based widget like this:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png" alt="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget." title="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This uses a slider approach (with five possible notches), and renders a description of what each notch corresponds to, i.e. “all or nearly all reps correct”.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>The second main thing was the ordering of the elements in the “Learn exercise” page. Each exercise has a step-by-step description of how to do the exercise, what controller inputs must be performed, background on the technique and its importance, a video tutorial, etc.</p>

<p>My assumption was that most people would read very little of it, so I should put the most important items first. However, various users disagreed on which item was the most important. There was no strong consensus, but the end result was this ordering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step-by-step exercise description.</li>
  <li>Controller inputs.</li>
  <li>Technique overview.</li>
  <li>The rest of the documentation elements (not as important).</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also hints on these steps such as how to enter the Training Stage to perform the exercises. Some users missed these steps altogether, and were left confused on how to perform the exercise. Unfortunately, I was unable to design a UI that mitigated this problem.</p>

<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h2>

<p>I chose to write a web-app, since they are cross-platform and I already had some familiarity with the area. In particular, I didn’t want to spend money on an iOS developer license, but I also didn’t want to exclude iOS users. (Post-hoc analytics indicate that the ratio of Android-to-iOS users is about 2:1, which consitutes a significant cohort for iOS.)</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build system</h3>

<p>All Javascript web-app bundling solutions are fundamentally terrible, and Webpack is no exception. But it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/f621f02af95da697435cb720563b590d57f38b87">I encountered one mysterious bug in Babel during development</a>, which I was unable to isolate. I worked around it by targeting only newer browsers, after which the problem disappeared.</p>

<p>I used <code>vue-cli-service</code> as a wrapper around the build, test, and lint actions, as recommended by Vue. But I found it hard to configure and debug. When I had an issue with tests not properly compiling an imported module, <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/blame/d0c31a33ab880e8c58824c0f58247c8bd8f38485/src/utils.ts#L38-L44">I gave up and reimplemented the function I needed myself</a>.</p>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, since I find its static typing system useful for maintenance purposes.</p>

<p>TypeScript support for Vue was not ideal. Many Vue patterns are not easy to express in TypeScript. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/istrib/vuex-typescript"><code>vuex-typescript</code></a> exist, but require a lot of boilerplate in order to get static typing support. The <a href="https://github.com/paroi-tech/direct-vuex"><code>direct-vuex</code></a> library had less boilerplate, but <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/9a8c0c0baf05d048a564b11f62afdfafc9f66a62">I couldn’t figure out how to test it</a>.</p>

<p>TypeScript was generally pleasant to work with, although in the project, I pushed it to its extremes and it was unable to keep pace. In my case, it was unable to track associated/mapped types adequately. It’s perhaps exemplified by this <code>@ts-ignore</code> comment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>TechVariantOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TechId</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// @ts-ignore "Type 'x' cannot be used to index type 'AllTechVariants'."</span>
  <span>// Strangely, the correct type is calculated here anyways, and can be used for</span>
  <span>// exhaustiveness-checking later.</span>
  <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>AllTechMetadata</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>variants</span><span>"</span><span>]]:</span> <span>AllTechVariants</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13215#issuecomment-531632919">this issue</a> when working on the same thing.</p>

<p>Given that this is reasonably advanced type-level hackery, I was generally happy with TypeScript’s ability to describe the data domain.</p>

<h3 id="vue">Vue</h3>

<p>I chose to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> as the front-end web framework, since I had heard good things about it from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. In particular, I wanted an opinionated framework, so as to spend less time configuring things myself.</p>

<p>When I used it, Vue promoted the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">“single-file component”</a> system, in which HTML, CSS, and Javascript are mixed into the same file. It was not a great experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This complicates the build process, as something has to convert these single-file components into assets consumable by the browser.</li>
  <li>The mental model is an extra layer of indirection, as these single-file components are themselves compiled into Javascript classes, but also contain Javascript classes in the script portion of the file.</li>
  <li>The tooling support was poor. For example, go-to-definition doesn’t work on the HTML components, despite the fact that they’re ultimately backed by Javascript classes.</li>
  <li>TypeScript does not check the HTML components.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would have preferred to use a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">JSX</a> solution, as it removes some of the indirection and has better tooling support.</p>

<p>I wish Vue had fewer ways to do things. For example, attributes on HTML elements can be set with the normal <code>=</code> syntax, but also with a leading <code>:</code> (expression evaluation) or a leading <code>@</code> (callback) for brevity. In comparison, React with JSX only has <code>=</code> for all of these situations.</p>

<h3 id="vuetify">Vuetify</h3>

<p><a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/">Vuetify</a> is a library to provide Material Design UI for Vue. The presence of a solid, all-in-one Material Design library was one other reason why I chose to use Vue. The library and documentation are both very good, and I was able to prototype my app (from a UI perspective) effectively. I would strongly recommend it if you’re using Vue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/8877">I opened one pull request</a> for the documentation, which was merged promptly, <a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/10140">and +1’d one documentation issue</a>, which has a workaround but unfortunately remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="netlify-for-hosting">Netlify for hosting</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host the front-end of the website using its free tier, and stored data locally for the user. This worked well, as Netlify knew how to build and deploy my Vue project, and had good Github integrations.</p>

<p>Another option would have been Github Pages, which would have made the project dependent on fewer underlying services, but also would have required me to write a build step of my own.</p>

<h3 id="custom-database">Custom database</h3>

<p>I stored data locally on the client using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"><code>localStorage</code> APIs</a>. I was careful to design the data schema such that it was append-only and such that each record had a unique ID, the idea being to make it easy to merge changes from multiple clients. However, this alone makes it difficult to delete records without some more thought.</p>

<p>I later discovered <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> as a distributed document-store in exactly the manner I had already architected my application, but including sync and delete capabilities. I also discovered the <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> library, which exposes a CouchDB interface and allows you to store your data locally or sync it remotely. It also supports more backends than just <code>localStorage</code>.</p>

<p>I wish I had used PouchDB from the beginning! Now I’m stuck with an inefficient, feature-lacking implementation of it, which would …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I recently created a series of articles and videos that goes through the
development of Kubernetes custom resources and controllers (see
<a href="https://gum.co/kubernetes-crds">gum.co/kubernetes-crds</a>), but I missed that
nice catchy example that would showcase what custom resources are all about.</p>
<p>So, why not implement the ultimate missing feature that Kubernetes should have?</p>

<h2 id="wait-but-why">wait, but why?</h2>
<p>no no, wait, <strong>why not</strong>?</p>
<p>see, with CI/CD being part of Kubernetes through projects like Argo and Tekton,
where you declare what your pipeline/workflow will be in terms of Kubernetes
resources, we’re now able to get that nice pizza for the team after a
successfull release.</p>

</code></pre><p>i don’t know about you, but that sounds quite right to me <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>
<h2 id="installation">installation</h2>
<p>being a legit Kubernetes custom resource, you install it just like you would
install Tekton, kpack, or anything like that: you submit a manifest that
contains the <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> objects to Kubernetes, a <code>Deployment</code>
that materializes the controller as a container in a pod, and then … that’s
it!</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller
cd pizza-controller

kapp deploy -a pizza-controller -f ./config/release.yaml


# OR .. plain old kubectl
#
kubectl apply -f ./config/release.yaml
</code></pre><h2 id="but-thats-dumb">but, that’s dumb</h2>
<p>i disagree</p>
<p>I think it’s a pretty cool example of the concepts behind extending
kubernetes via custom resources, and something that might bring you some
thoughts of ways in which you could bring the
declarative nature of Kubernetes objects plus the level-triggered approach to
controllers to bring to Kubernetes the ability to request external resources.</p>
<p>for instance, projects like <a href="https://crossplane.io/">crossplane</a> give you pretty
much that, except that instead of ordering a pizza, you’re ordering … a
database (or things like that).</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h2>
<p>are you <em>really</em> into ordering pizza using <code>kubectl</code>?</p>
<p>like, really? are you sure?</p>
<p>here’s what’s missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>well, any .. tests :horse:</li>
<li>order tracking (it’s <code>xml</code>-based - SOAP stuff)</li>
<li>being more flexible with non-canadian folks (it’s currently hardcoded for
Canada, but could easily be changed)</li>
</ul>
<p>at the moment I got my pizza .. development finished :sweat_smile: maybe you’ll
carry it forward? head to <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller">https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Rust has an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-next/dbg-macro.html">amazing dbg macro</a> that lets you quickly set up an expression printer that will also put in the source line. It also returns the value of the expression so you can even easily inline the printing when you want to! </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Doing a bunch of Python, I <em>want this</em> in Python as well. I want a debug macro, one that gives me the file location + the expression used to calculate the value.</p>
<p>My <em>ideal</em> would be to have a function where <code>dbg(foo.bar[1])</code> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>print <code>[source line] foo.bar[1] = &lt;the value&gt;</code></li>
<li>return the value so we can use it within expressions easily</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing this by hand I always reach for <code>f</code>-strings, to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"foo.bar[1]=</span><span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is annoying because you end up typing the same expression twice, you can't inline it, and it just doesn't look very cool.</p>
<p>The first thing when trying to implement this is to come to terms with Python's lack of macros. You can't really mess with the syntax tree, so you're really only operating on calculated values. So it's really hard to capture an expression <em>and its result</em> in a single operation because, well, your expressions get evaluated.</p>
<p>So it'll be hard, to print <code>some_expr = &lt;result of some_expr&gt;</code> without providing the string of <code>some_expr</code> at one point.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, thanks to <code>eval</code>, you can flip this idea on its head. You <em>need</em> the string for the expression, but you don't need the expression itself!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'bar'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar'[]"</span><span>))</span> <span># prints 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One step backwards, let's now go two steps forward. We can start writing our <code>dbg</code> helper function</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"bar"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>  <span># foo['bar'] = 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good, we have a nice pretty printer here at the cost of two quotation marks.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't work perfectly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span> <span># expr = expr</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that when calling <code>eval</code> without arguments we are evaluating <em>within the scope of <code>dbg</code></em>. Our examples work because <code>dbg</code> is defined alongside our expressions (so <code>foo</code> is accessible within <code>dbg</code>) but it's susceptible to name shadowing or outright not being able to calculate the expression because it could be defined in a different scope</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span># we're calculating the result here....</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span># but actually want to calculate</span>
<span># the result within this scope</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>eval</code> by default will evaluate the expression within the current frame. But we can pass in our own globals and locals to instead evaluate the expression within an arbitrary environment</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>}))</span> <span># gives 4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let's reproduce the caller's environment to get us the right results. Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, <em>getting source code</em>, inspecting classes and functions, and <em>examining the interpreter stack</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try out <code>inspect.stack()</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>

<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Passed"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>trying this out, we get the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this is in a function call we'll actually need to go up the stack one frame (<code>inspect.stack()[1]</code>) to get the proper line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'dbg("foo[</span><span>\'</span><span>bar</span><span>\'</span><span>]")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'dbg("expr")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'if dbg("True"):</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, now we are getting closer to where we need. the second element in our stack is where we'll also get the file path and the line number. Let's clean this up a bit and now we get:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we have the full file path... one might do a trick here to stick with the file name:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>filename</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"[</span><span>{</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>{</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>lineno</span><span>}</span><span>] </span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so with this we end up with the following nice printed output</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so this is good on the formatting. But we still haven't fixed <code>eval</code>! That's a tiny fix this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_globals</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_locals</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gets us the right values, properly evaluating <code>expr</code> from the calling scope instead of <code>dbg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> 
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_locals</code> on the frames is still one of my favorite Python features. It lets basically anyone write very good debugging tools without having to do a bunch of magic.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you're an IPython user you can add this to <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-startup-files">a startup script</a>  over in <code>~/.ipython/profile_default/</code> and make this available in any interactive shell.</p>
<p>For those who value silly things like correctness, performance, and intellectual integrity your journey ends here. This is a nice little helper that you can use in your projects, and there's nothing else for you to see here.</p>
<p>For those who like to live dangerously, I have something to show you.....</p>
<p>



So.</p>
<p>Inside the frame, we have a bunch of information, but one thing that's pretty nice for explorative debugging is the <code>code_context</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
<span># prints dbg('foo["bar"]')</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we actually have the source line from the <code>dbg</code> call built in!</p>
<p>Let's imagine going back a bit to our "idealized" debug function:</p>


<p>Now, if we ran such a function, the body would receive the <em>value</em> of <code>foo['bar']</code> and not the expression. <em>But</em> thanks to the stack we could theoretically recover the original expression! </p>
<p>This gets a bit tricker if you want to do more clever stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>)))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
   <span>do_stuff</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But let's try to work this out from first principles a bit.</p>
<p>If you have the source code line with the <code>dbg</code> call, how can you recover the expression being debugged?</p>
<p>The first thing is just to find the beginning of the expression. That's pretty easy, just look for <code>dbg(</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
   ^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we find the beginning of the expression, right? And since a function call in Python is an open parentheses, some expressions, then a close parentheses, we just have to find the close parentheses and we have the string fragment representing our expression. Let's apply the logic here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great! Our expression is <code>my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "(</code>. Definitely what we wanted. Yep.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where the only way to parse out an expression is to actually parse it out. Simple string matching won't cut it, especially when you start getting inner function calls in the mix.</p>
<p>You could write a simple parser, try and count parens, open quotes, escaping in quotes, all the fun little games. But honestly I want a thing that works, and I don't want to think about it too hard.</p>
<p>I just want to find out where the expression is in this string.</p>
<p>So here's my amazing plan to deal with this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == '</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")'</span><span>)</span>
<span># doesn't fail =&gt; I have my expression!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just start with the longest possible string, and slowly shrink it until I find something that looks like an expression. Because the <code>)</code> from the debug call imbalances everything I'm like... 80% sure that this way of finding the expression is correct.</p>
<p>There are some edge cases that make this strategy not work. For example if you do something like:</p>


<p>You have two <code>dbg</code>s on the same line, so it's hard to know <em>which</em> call you're in, because you're only provided the line number. (On some other project I spent a lot of time hand-wringing on this exact problem and could not find a solution, even with tricks like counting executions. I'm fairly convinced this is equivalent to the halting problem somehow)</p>
<p>And to be honest my solution here isn't battle-tested, it just feels right and works with the complicated expressions I've thrown at it. But it was a fun thing to write and now the following works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>])</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 49] foo["bar"] = 3</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 52] my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()") = 5</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Success"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No more stringifying silliness, no more calls to <code>eval</code>, just a really silly parsing hack that has no real foundation except my gut feeling. </p>
<p>Good enough for me!</p>
<p>the final implemetaion is below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Recover the expression giving the result, and then</span>

<p><strong>Transcript: </strong>Lecture two will attempt to answer one of the paradoxes I raised in the first lecture – and this will be a specific form of it – and that’s a rather famous charge in philosophy. In fact this is the charge of relativism and one of the things that professional philosophers do in order to display their professional credentials is to respond to the relativist and to the sceptic. Nietzsche has been accused of being a relativist. One form of this accusation is a kind of mislabelling – in my opinion it’s a mislabelling – of Nietzsche’s view about the function of truth and lie. He opposes that to true and false. Truth and lie. The function of that within philosophical discourse. He has an account of that we are going to discuss. <span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>One of the ways that philosophers have mislabelled this position is “perspectivism”, and the reason I hate that label is like “relativism”, it makes someone think that someone – in this case Nietzsche, or someone else – might hold the absolutely ridiculous view that every view was as good as every other view. That is a complete straw person argument. No-one has ever – or does now – hold the view that every view is as good as every other view.</p>
<p>So whenever the spectre of relativism is raised, you know, by someone for you, either in the popular press or in a university setting, the first small thing that should come to your mind is there aren’t any. So the refutation in a certain sense is bound to miss at least one point, namely that you are not arguing against anyone. Now it could be the case that my audience today, or the audience that will watch the tapes, I will find someone in the United States, or across the world that will hold the view that every other view is as good as every other view. But if I do, it will be very idiosyncratic, and in my experience so far, no.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is not a relativist, and I think perspectivism is also an unfortunate term to describe Nietzsche’s style of thinking. Because perspectivism calls up the idea that, “Well, I am right from my perspective, and you are right from your perspective, and everybody is right from their perspectives”, and I also don’t believe that that’s a view that anyone can hold or has ever held. I think, and this is the the way I will try to discuss Nietzsche’s paradox in terms of relativism, is that…</p>
<p>Nietzsche was opposed to what might be called the dogmatism of not only the Western Philosophical tradition, but the Western Theoretical tradition in general. Its dogmatism in this regard. Believing… about its beliefs that they were good not only for them and their tribe… because after all Western Civilisation is a big word… it’s a strange word… you know, big words and strange words, but, after all it is just a very large tribe with very large armies and lots of televisions… and a large historical project, but still its a tribe. Big, big tribe.</p>
<p>I think Nietzsche considered it dogmatic to hold that your beliefs – or the beliefs of your tribe – were binding on all. That is the way I want to present Nietzsche’s perspectivism. In other words, he didn’t believe that all beliefs were equally good, interesting, or whatever. In fact, I am sure he considered some of his own beliefs to be far more interesting than for example, the beliefs of John Stuart Mill, who he referred to as “That blockhead”. Or I think that he found his views more interesting than the views of the English Utilitarians in general, about whom he said “No human beings want to be happy. Only the British want that”. [crowd laughter]. So I think he thinks his views were more interesting than those.</p>
<p>And I think where the dogmatism for Nietzsche came in was when you search for views… and then develop your beliefs, and then think that they should be binding on all. This is not a criticism that you shouldn’t have beliefs, or that all your beliefs are no better than anyone else’s. It’s just the further belief about your beliefs that everyone else should believe the same damn way. So it’s a meta-belief, if you will. A belief about your beliefs.</p>
<p>In fact I think that it’s perfectly consistent to believe a wide number of things with a great deal of passion, and then believe about those beliefs that you could be wrong. I hope that’s not a further paradox, I do not think that it is. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent to believe something passionately, to believe it in a very deep way and have a belief about that belief that “Well, you know. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p>So the dogmatism that Nietzsche is after runs very deep in our theoretical traditions. I can’t overestimate this. It’s a dogmatism that has continued throughout what might be called the project of the West, and it’s even built into the Socratic pursuit. When Socrates asks the question “What is X?”, and what fills in the “X” are those famous Greek ideals; virtue, excellence, beauty, goodness, and so on. Now Nietzsche had the highest respect for Socrates, and as I just said, as I said before, Nietzsche considered him to be an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary', 'exemplary']);">exemplary</a> person, coupled with Plato’s construction of him, they in a way were ideal for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But the dogmatic part of Socrates was that Socrates wanted – for Nietzsche – Socrates wanted an answer to the question “What is X”, like what is beauty, goodness, truth, excellence. It wouldn’t be good for just Socrates, or good for the Greeks, but once discovered had to bind everyone. In other words, it wouldn’t be enough just to believe it, which seems… what Nietzsche calls the gay, happy theorist to be enough, to just find a belief that you can live with and believe. No, the theoretical enterprise of the West is imperialistic in a way. It’s got to find a belief that others then have to believe, and that he considered dogmatic.</p>
<p>This by the way you may notice is not – in my view – a relativist position at all. Because it’s not inconsistent with the view that you think your beliefs – precisely because they are your beliefs – are superior to some other beliefs. In fact I take it to be banally the case that if you didn’t think that, they wouldn’t be your beliefs. In other words, somebody comes up to you and gives you some other ones and you go “Oh hell, those are better than mine”. Then they will be yours after you have heard them out, right? So it seems fairly natural that you believe your beliefs. The dogmatic assumption is that everyone else should believe your beliefs. And this is not relativism. There have been some modern philosophical names attached to this position called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism', 'fallibilism']);">fallibilism</a>, and yet Nietzsche is too interesting in a certain way to be called that either.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to present Nietzsche not specifically within that philosophical context, but I do want to present him as addressing it, which he does. And anyone who has ever addressed any issue in philosophy knows that the irritating thing is how the simplest questions can turn into philosophical ones. Sometimes philosophers realise that what we do is ask a series of rhetorical questions that come up whenever people are very frustrated. In other words, we ask questions like “What the hell does that mean?”. You know, generally in a fight – a domestic fight – a rhetorical question. “I can’t do the dishes now” – “Well what the hell does that mean?”. Well, the philosopher takes that rhetorical question and just places it in a foreign context. Someone goes “There’s an object” and you go “Object… what the hell does that mean?” [crowd laughter]. In the other context, the remark had a home and a meaning, and so it means that the person’s <em>pissed</em>, I guess. Or <em>upset</em>, okay. In this other context though, “What does it – you know – does it mean?” doesn’t seem to have any purchase.</p>
<p>About those, sort of, metaphysical beliefs, Nietzsche was no metaphysician. In fact, he thought that was, in a way, a very pompous thing to be. To try to answer those kinds of questions in a way binding for all. Now I call that a kind of <em>imperialism</em>, and I didn’t use that political term without thinking about it for a while. It’s the kind of imperialism – this dogmatic tradition against which Socrates saw himself fighting – is the kind of imperialist tradition we might have in some of our educational institutions when we have an African-American student who speaks eloquent rap street language talk. And I am not trying to say that’s all that African-Americans speak. Some of them are Neo-Conservatives that garble around as bad as others. Paleo-Conservatives. You know, some are just as unfortunately stupid as their Anglo-American, or Anglo-Saxon counterparts.</p>
<p>No, but I mean I am talking now about, you know, someone who does… says “ain’t” and repeats themselves, rhymes and things. Well, in a way it’s just imperialistic to think that that is somehow less profound than the Cambridge accent that discusses in detail the problem of relativism. It is not only a class and a racial bias, it’s just stupid. Because, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James', 'William James']);">William James</a> once said “The trail of the human serpent is over all”. There are many forms of life, many cultures, many ways to look at things. And Nietzsche at his best expresses in his work that diversity and that complexity of the many ways to interpret, to speak.</p>
<p>Now, “imperialistic” in this educational sense means that we want you to leave our institutions of higher learning talking like we talk and writing like we write. And we divide through by the issue of whether you think at all, because all the evidence we have for that is what you have said and what you have written. You may be not thinking at all, or thinking very bizarre thoughts, or you may be on some hallucinogenic drug, who knows what’s inside. But if you leave there writing like we write, talking like we talk – in short obeying relations of power – then you are educated. You certainly… and certainly Nietzsche saw this as conformity, and not connected with truth.</p>
<p>So …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he year was 2003, and the first human genome had been <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" target="_blank">sequenced</a>.</p>
<p>By almost every metric, it was an extraordinary achievement. The completion of the Human Genome Project provided a starting point for scientists to study the “<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/" target="_blank">blueprint for building a person</a>”. Pharmaceutical companies suddenly possessed a genetic chart to design more targeted medicines. Archaeologists gained a roadmap to compare human genomes through the ages. Biologists acquired a lodestar to locate the genes governing health and behavior. The floodgates of the genomic era had officially opened. But the project also revealed a mystery.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, scientists <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/5yrplan/index.shtml" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the Human Genome Project would unveil 100,000 human genes. But the sequencing results revealed a stark reality: humans only have 20,000 genes—<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118530" target="_blank">10,000 fewer than a water flea</a>. It seems remarkable that humans—with our fancy bipedalism and oversized brains—could have fewer genes than a microscopic crustacean.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the two decades since the Human Genome Project. The technology to sequence genes has gotten cheaper and faster. The first human genome sequence cost three billion dollars, involved thousands of scientists, and took 13 years to complete. Today, sequencing machines can read a human genome in less than a day for a few hundred dollars. But technology is not a substitute for knowledge, and scientists still don’t fully understand how the genome works.</p>

<p>Nestled in the back corner of the <a href="https://broadfoundation.org/grantees/the-broad-center-for-biological-science-at-caltech/" target="_blank">Broad Center for the Biological Sciences</a> at Caltech, our research laboratory aims to understand how genomes encode and express information. To find us on campus, look for the cubic building made from metal and travertine, with sweeping views of the San Gabriel mountains. On a clear day many months ago, before the pandemic confined us to untidy apartments, we could see Mt. Wilson Observatory from our offices. Its white telescopes dot the mountain’s summit, silhouetted against the rising sun. Inside the lab, our benches are cluttered with liquid-filled bottles and metal pipettes.</p>
<p>We study genomes, in part, because of the impact on our impressionable young minds when the Human Genome Project made national news back in 2003. The structure of DNA had been <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/" target="_blank">established</a> fifty years earlier, thanks to herculean efforts from Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and others. Our understanding of genomes came a long way in those 50 years, from structure to sequence. But we know that there is more to learn.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/01/09/illumina-promises-to-sequence-human-genome-for-100-but-not-quite-yet/#14098b8f386d" target="_blank">500,000 human genomes</a> have been sequenced since 2003. Sequencing machines are now commonplace at universities. Humming on tables, they look like space-age computer systems, with touch screens and tiny, pneumatic tubes. DNA is extracted from living cells, trillions of copies are made using a technique called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matsiHSuoOw&amp;vl=en" target="_blank">PCR</a>, and the copied molecules are loaded (carefully!) into the machine. A few hours later, after the humming subsides, an interminable string of characters appears on the screen, made up of four letters: A, T, C, and G.</p>
<p>All genomes on earth are made up of these letters, called nucleotides. Each letter is a unique molecule—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—that links up to the others, forming a minimal alphabet. With these four letters, our cells construct words, or—in the context of biology—genes.</p>
<p>Much as a Xerox machine can make thousands of copies from a single document, genes are converted to messenger RNA in a process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whV_CkKT7F0" target="_blank">transcription</a>, which then serves as a template to build proteins. The human genome encodes about 20,000 genes, which in turn produce proteins that fend off viral invaders, manage blood sugar levels, and everything in between.</p>
<iframe width="280" height="156" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M198uHJd_8?start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This short animation shows how transcription happens.</p>

<p>But we cannot “see” these dynamic changes with a DNA sequence. The order of letters in a genome tells us nothing about how a gene is controlled in the molecular confines of a cell. Gene expression is dynamic and changing. Genes are turned on and off as proteins are needed, and these changes over time may explain how genomes can give rise to the most beautiful of lifeforms. In other words, it may explain how we are human, despite a trifling 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>We study how genomes are controlled because we want to understand ourselves. In doing so, we are building upon more than 80 years of experimental history.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1940s, Jacques Monod and François Jacob, frantically working in a little laboratory in the Necker neighborhood of Paris, found that cells control protein numbers by turning genes “on” or “off”. Though their results seem obvious today (the best results always do), they shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1965/summary/" target="_blank">1965 Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine for their work.</p>
<p>Genes are regulated by proteins called transcription factors, of which there are two types: activators, which bind to DNA near the start of a gene and increase the amount of mRNA copies made from a gene, much like loading more paper into a Xerox tray, and repressors, which decrease the amount of mRNA copies. Transcription factors hold dominion over the genome, controlling when each gene gets to make its Xerox copies.</p>
<p>Jacob and Monod’s findings provided a potential solution to the question that arose from the first human genome sequence, 60 years later. Perhaps an organism’s complexity is dictated not by how many genes are present in a genome, but rather by how those genomes are controlled, over time, by transcription factors.
To build upon the work of our scientific heroes, our lab at Caltech wanted to determine which type of transcription factor—activator or repressor—regulates each and every gene. To test our experiments, we decided to start with a small genome. We turned to a bacterium, <em>Escherichia coli</em>.</p>
<p>In the grand order of nature, <em>E. coli</em> is relatively simple, containing 4,000 genes and 200 transcription factors. But, despite its meager size, we still do not know how two-thirds of its genes are regulated.</p>
<p><img src="https://caltechletters.org/media/posts/2020-11-03-decoding-the-genome/ecoli_genome.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <i>E. coli</i> genome contains about 4.6 million nucleotides and 4,000 genes. In this diagram, genes that have known regulation (which means that we know which transcription factors regulate them) are marked in blue. For most genes (roughly two-thirds), we have no idea which transcription factors regulate or control them (marked in red).</p>
<p>Diagram by Niko McCarty</p>
<p>We knew that if we ever wanted to understand how even a small bacterial genome is regulated, a new experimental method would be needed. So we <i>created</i> one.</p>
<hr>
<p>When <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/theriotlab/members/" target="_blank">Nathan Belliveau</a> joined the lab, a few years ago, his objective was simple: find an easy way to determine how genes in <em>E. coli</em> are regulated.</p>
<p>Sitting at the bench, he harvested genetic material from <em>E. coli</em> and loaded the DNA into a sequencer. After a few years—and hundreds of trials—he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4796" target="_blank">reported</a> the foundations of a radical method that would eventually enable our laboratory to figure out which transcription factors regulate hundreds, or thousands, of genes at a time. Nathan left the group in 2017, PhD in hand, and flew to colder climates. Bill Ireland and Suzy Beeler (an author of this article) took over the project.</p>
<p>They, too, spent years agonizing over the method. After using thousands of tubes of DNA and covering their benches in teetering stacks of bacteria-streaked agar plates, Bill and Suzy managed to extend Nathan’s findings to more than a hundred genes. In the process, they refined a powerful method that lends deep insights into the intricate, molecular machines that regulate genomes.</p>
<p>Here’s how the method works.</p>
<p>We begin by literally mail ordering short sequences of DNA—the regions immediately in front of a gene—where transcription factors typically bind. A computer helps us design mutated versions of each DNA sequence, randomly changing the letters until we have thousands of variants for each sequence. A company in San Francisco takes our digital letters, creates physical copies, and ships them in a little plastic tube to our laboratory. We then place these synthetic pieces of DNA inside of <em>E. coli</em> cells, and use a modified version of DNA sequencing to determine whether each “letter” change made a gene produce more or fewer Xerox copies.</p>
<p>If a DNA sequence produces very little RNA inside of the cell, this suggests that the letter change (or mutation) blocked transcription; it choked up the Xerox machine. It also indicates that an activator was probably binding to that DNA sequence, and the mutation prevented it from doing its job. Some mutations, however, increase the amount of RNA produced from a DNA sequence, suggesting that the mutation is preventing a repressor from binding.</p>
<p>By analyzing this data and running it through mathematical models, we can determine whether each gene is regulated by an activator or repressor, how many transcription factors regulate each gene, and where those transcription factors actually bind.</p>
<p>In other words, we can map the genome’s regulatory networks.</p>

<p>After performing this experiment on more than one hundred genes, we made some startling discoveries. In one case, we found a transcription factor with dual activity: it activated the transcription of one gene while repressing the transcription of another. We also identified transcription factors that are only active in certain environments; when <em>E. coli</em> is grown in the presence of a sugar, for example, a transcription factor called GlpR represses a handful of genes. Without the sugar, GlpR doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55308" target="_blank">study</a> marks a major advancement in genomic research. But it didn’t come for free.</p>
<p>Throughout the last five years, we have failed repeatedly. We have mislabeled tubes and used ethanol instead of water to dilute DNA. We have dropped flasks, shattering glass and spilling bacteria on the floor. We have been frustrated, again and again. But we continued on, inching closer …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n the sheltered lagoons of the Great Barrier Reef lie sandy flats the size of Switzerland where reef-building corals refuse to grow. Much of the seafloor here resembles a moonscape hewn with small eruptions—the modest houses of timid crustacean architects.&nbsp;</p><p>Each year, however, when the sunlight filters through in just the right way, thousands of stout, spoon-shaped leaves encrusted with silvery hairs begin to emerge. Linked by spindly runners, they cover the seafloor within a few weeks, forming a fine herbage that dots the sediment. For several months they cling to the seabed, blossoming with tiny flowers that fruit and float below the tide. Soon they will shed their seeds into the sandy banks and lay in wait for the right sunlight to filter through once again.<br></p>
<p>Growing in interstitial spaces too deep for SCUBA-diving scientists and too shallow for deep-sea exploration vehicles, deep-water seagrasses are hidden powerhouses that have sprouted silently on the peripheries for tens of millions of years. Yet even as seagrasses are globally recognized as among Earthâ€™s most important and productive ecosystems, studies have largely focused on shallow meadows found at depths of 15 meters or less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deeper meadows like those in the Great Barrier Reef lagoons have long been overlooked, in part because theyâ€™re literally difficult to see: as depth increases, light loses certain wavelengths, and colors are quickly muted. By the early 1990s, though, scientists had calculated that, based on physiological limitations, seagrasses should survive to around 90 meters below the surface. Potentially vast meadows remained to be discovered.</p>
<p>These meadows are the focus of Michael Rasheed and Paul York, biologists at James Cook University in Australia. Rasheed started studying these important yet obscure habitats in the mid-1990â€™s, when he was part of a team that towed cameras behind research vessels to map habitats across vast areas of ocean. Waiting in vain to catch an on-screen glimpse of the leafy meadows amongst the watery moonscape, the limitations of the technology quickly became apparent.</p>
<p>York, Rasheed and their colleagues took a different approach. In their part of the world, fat, nine-foot-long dugongs—a member of the taxonomic order that includes manatees—munch up to 35 kilograms of seagrasses a day. By following dugongs, the researchers discovered more than 30,000 square kilometers of seagrass meadows growing on the margins of their biological limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among these were the largest continuous seagrass meadow mapped in Australian waters, covering some 8,750 square kilometers and consisting mostly of deep-water grasses. These new beds represented a huge increase in the potential area across which seagrasses, already known to sequester up to twice as much carbon per acre as terrestrial forests, and at dramatically faster rates, may buffer against climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another group of researchers led by Nicole Esteban from Swansea University in Wales also followed animals to deep-water seagrasses. By tracking GPS-tagged green sea turtles thousands of kilometers, Esteban and her colleagues discovered significant feeding territories on the remote Chagos Archipelago in the Western Indian Ocean. In 2016, Estebanâ€™s team were the first scientists to dive these new sites; they expected to find the meadows at depths of 10 meters, but soon realized they extended far deeper.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_b958b97b3ad6d40d9b35e81f06058619.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-08 at 11.48.24 PM"><figcaption><span>Life teems above a carpet of deep-water Thalassodendron ciliatum seagrass. In the foreground is a baited camera. </span><br><span>Nicole Esteban</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>B</span>eneath the waves licking the edge of the worldâ€™s largest atoll, the Great Chagos Bank, a white calcium carbonate hill leads down to the depths. Against the current, shadows of glistening, scaled bodies wash over the seabed. Grasping coralline rubble, tangles of forty-centimeter long leaves shoot towards the filtered sunlight. Like lime green fingers waving to the shattered ceiling of water, they briefly interlock before sighing away in new directions as the swell rolls on across the slope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the system where York and Rasheed work, Estebanâ€™s plunge took her to gardens where <i>Thalassodendron ciliatum</i>, one of the largest seagrasses on the planet, covers up to 90 percent of the seabed and has hundreds of fish like the large predatory grey reef shark, African white-spotted rabbitfish and red snapper swimming overhead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of safety restrictions on diving below 25 meters, Estebanâ€™s team deployed underwater cameras. They revealed that seagrasses were abundant down to at least 29 meters depth. The discovery there suggested that seagrasses could extend across hundreds—possibly even thousands—of kilometers of the Chagos Archipelago, completely changing existing maps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presence of such expansive canopies suggests that, in addition to sequestering carbon, deep-water seagrass meadows provide an important safe haven of food and habitat for countless marine species, including many that are currently endangered.
</p>
<p>Updated with findings like these, estimates now suggest that the real global seagrass-meadow footprint could be 35 times greater than previous estimates of 150,000 to 600,000 square kilometers, covering an area roughly the size of the United States. These meadows may be critical refuges, for in the darker, cooler parts of the ocean these seagrasses may escape the worst of climate change and ocean-warming effects.</p>
<p>Now the seagrass research community is planning to follow still more marine megaherbivores to find and understand new seagrass habitats. The West Indies, Kenya and Mozambique are high on the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shallow-water seagrass meadows have already been recognized as a powerful nature-based climate solution by the United Nations. They stabilize sediments and prevent erosion, protect corals, and provide critical food and habitat for thousands of species. They suck in carbon dioxide, locking it into sediment up to 40 times faster than the typical terrestrial forest, and release oxygen in return. Deep-water seagrasses likely sequester less carbon per acre than their shallow-water brethren but occupy a larger area, meaning their sequestration potential is likely vast as well.</p>
<p>Shallow-water seagrass meadows are rapidly disappearing, though, killed by pollution and dredging and ecosystem-disrupting human activity—and deep-water seagrasses may be threatened, too.</p>
<p>Without knowing exactly where deep-water meadows lie, though, we are limited in our ability to understand their value or protect them. Without exploration our knowledge is restricted to chance discoveries and anecdotal evidence. The most extreme examples suggest that seagrasses may grow even deeper than our best estimates: in 2003 some tendrils of <i>Halophila stipulacea, </i>a particularly hardy species adapted to low light, were collected while dredging at depths of 145 meters off the Cyprus coast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such discoveries of deep-water meadows radically expand our knowledge of seagrasses. They provide much-needed optimism that pristine places still exist, and remind us that there is still so much we have yet to learn.</p>

A little exciting.</p><p>I’d been wanting to talk to Matt for a while, in part because the pope actually turned down my recent interview request (someone please tell him how book tours work).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:264,&quot;width&quot;:1308,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51146,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>And in part because I consider him (Matt) one of the more interesting, iconoclastic, morally committed, unpredictable, critics-may-care thinkers today. In the course of a typical Twitter day, which is a week in human time, I agree with Matt, disagree with him, wish I had thought of something he said, regret something he said on his behalf, retweet something he wrote, and make a mental note to talk with him soon. So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

But to tide you by until I'm back, I thought you might enjoy listening to my talk from PAX Australia 2019 about the lesser-known of the indie game publishing giants from before the time of Braid and Steam and all that other stuff we've had over the past 15 years.</p><p>The talk was called The Rise &amp; Fall of Ambrosia Software, '90s Mac Legends, and you can find accompanying slides at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk</a> as well as my full script on the accompanying blog post at lifeandtimes.games. So please, enjoy, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p><div><p><em>[note that this won't correspond exactly to the audio, as it was my written script rather than what I actually said. If you're looking at the slides, "[NEXT]" means go to the next slide.]]<br></em><br>Hello everyone. My name is Richard Moss, and today I'm going to talk to you about a company that's pretty near and dear to my heart, not only as someone who grew up playing some of their games — [NEXT] but also as the author of a book called The Secret History of Mac Gaming, which covers their history, along with lots of other games and game developers from the 1980s and 90s Mac gaming scene. [NEXT]</p><p>If you were a Mac gamer in the late 90s, chances are pretty high that you would have had at least one game in your collection that came from Ambrosia Software. [NEXT] They were heroes among the Macintosh faithful, one of only a few companies that made its games exclusive to the Mac. And arguably the best among them in terms of the quality of its output.</p><p>Games like [NEXT] Maelstrom, [NEXT] Escape Velocity, [NEXT] Ferazel's Wand, [NEXT] Apeiron, and [NEXT] Bubble Trouble were hallmarks of quality, even if most of them were essentially just jazzed-up versions of classic 80s games. And they had top-drawer offbeat gaming options, too, with titles like [NEXT] Avara, a kinda abstract-looking arena-style first-person shooter, and [NEXT] Harry the Handsome Executive, where you guide a middle management executive through an office electronics apocalypse while scooting around in a swivel chair.</p><p>For about 15 years or so, from 1993 to around 2008, the Ambrosia Software name was inseparable from quality Macintosh games. But then it faded rapidly into the background, for reasons I'll get to later, and finally the company closed its doors at the end of last year.</p><p>***</p><p>So in recognition of Ambrosia's achievements, which have slipped a bit under the radar outside of the old-school Mac faithful, I wanted to give you a tour through the company's rise and fall. </p><p>There's not enough time to cover everything, but I'll try to get to all the key stuff and you'll hopefully come away with a good sense of a) why Ambrosia Software matters to the history of computer games and b) what made Ambrosia special to the Macintosh flock. </p><p>I've got some interview clips, a bit of gameplay footage, some photos and old documents to help us along the way. I wanted to set up an emulator as well but just ran out of time unfortunately. And hopefully there'll be plenty of time at the end for questions and stories from you in the audience.</p><p>But before we go into rise and fall of Ambrosia, let's do some quick background. First, on Ambrosia founder Andrew Welch. Then second on the Mac gaming scene in the early 90s.</p><p>[NEXT] So, Andrew Welch. His dad owned a marketing company, and it was through that business that young Andrew planted the seed for what would become Ambrosia. When he was something like 12 or 13 years old, he found the company's library of books and documents on typography. He thought it was cool, so he learnt how to design his own typefaces on his Macintosh. Then, starting from age 14 or so, he sold them on America OnLine.</p><p>But most people doing this sold their fonts without any documentation at all, so there was no way to know after the fact who made it, how to pay for it, who to contact for support, and so on. So Andrew taught himself how to code a utility program that could wrap his fonts in a simple document reader thing.</p><p>He enjoyed coding so much that he kept doing it, and made various other utilities for his relatives. Then he went off to college to study photojournalism and in his spare time he created [NEXT] his first game, a Wheel of Fortune clone called Wacky Wheel.</p><p>[NEXT] [show it in action]</p><p>This was kind of par for the course with small Mac games at the time. There were lots of people putting out crappy little games as freeware or shareware, but even the rare good ones weren't really making anything more than pizza and beer money.</p><p>[NEXT] Or literally beer.</p><p>Quick definition of shareware: [NEXT] it's software that you give away, free, but you ask that if someone likes it they pay you a registration fee — which, depending on the exact implementation, might get that person customer support or free updates or maybe just remove the nag screen from the boot-up process.</p><p>[NEXT] This is a pretty typical shareware notice, taken from an early DOS game.</p><p>Over on the PC side, shareware had already taken off. [NEXT] Apogee Software and Epic MegaGames were making a fortune working with independent developers and selling their games in a clever twist of the standard shareware model called The Apogee Model. Instead of giving away the whole thing for free and requesting that people pay if they like it, Apogee and Epic's games were [NEXT] episodic — episode one distributed freely over the internet and BBSs and through mail-order floppy disks, and all subsequent episodes available to order for a set fee.</p><p>I'm actually writing a book about this stuff, so if you're curious to learn more ask me about it later.</p><p>And id Software were just starting to make their name at this point as well. [NEXT] Wolfenstein 3D dropped in 92, then [NEXT] Doom in 93, both published as shareware on PC through Apogee. </p><p>So the time was ripe for shareware to step up and hit the big time on the Mac side, too. The Mac was at the peak of its [NEXT] pre-iMac popularity. College kids across the United States had Macs set up in their dorm rooms, while creative professionals all around the world had taken up the Mac mantle and were keen for more time-wasters to get them through the lulls in their output.</p><p>But there weren't many games coming out — the porting industry, which took PC games and put them on Mac, was still in its infancy after struggling with the [NEXT] peculiarities of adapting games for the Mac's multi-window mouse and menu-driven interface. Truly cross-platform commercial computer games that had concurrent Mac and PC releases were still rare (though there were a few special ones like [NEXT] SimCity 2000), and Mac-first development had gone into a bit of a lull (for a variety of reasons) at the end of the 1980s — from which it had yet to fully recover.</p><p>So there was lots of room for a great new Mac-native game to stand out.</p><p>And, crucially for our story here, someone was wrong on the Internet. I'll let you hear this bit straight from Andrew: [NEXT]</p><p><em>AW: I think it was the summer after maybe my freshman year of college that someone had said — I think it was called the Mac IIci or something like that. It was one of the colour Macs that came out. And someone had said something about the fact that while it was too slow to do decent animation on — and by that point in time I had actually taught myself for Assembly language, as well. So I set out to prove this guy wrong, because it's always fun to try to prove someone on the Internet that they're wrong. <p>*laughs* So, yeah, so that's how I started writing — and I really wasn't sure what I was going to do yet — but I started writing some kind of animation stuff. I grew up going to a lot of the arcades where we played games like Asteroids and Centipede and that type of thing where after school I would get dropped off there and play. So I decided to make an Asteroids-based game.</p></em></p><p>[NEXT]<br>He asked a couple of friends to help him out with the graphics, and got together with a few of his college buddies and a microphone to make a bunch of silly noises and record stuff off the TV for sound effects.</p><p>They pulled liberally from pop culture, drawing tiny clips and references (without permission) from all over the place, kind of like the wall of sound that early hip-hop and remix culture had.[NEXT]</p><p>He called the game Maelstrom and put it online as shareware, published under the name Ambrosia Software — a name he pulled from Greek mythology. You could play it and share it freely, but it'd nag you to send in a cheque to register every time you booted the game. And a lot of people did. [NEXT]</p><p><em>everyday we would go to the mailbox and there'd be letters from all over the world. I just had a blast. I thought it was really really cool that I could do something just sitting in my room in upstate New York, which was where I was at the time. And I got these contacts from all over the world. I thought that was really really cool, and it was at a time where people were just starting to get connected online.<p>Like now it's no big deal — you can go on …</p></em></p></div></div>

    <div>
        <p><span>algorithms</span></p><p>At some point in life, most people have stood over a rolled-out slab of cookie dough and pondered just how to best cut out cookies with as little waste as possible. Now, even math experts have given up on finding a computer algorithm to answer this type of geometric problem.
</p>
    </div>

<p>How can we maximize dough while cutting out Christmas cookies? How do we pack a suitcase or fill a kitchen cabinet while making the best use of space? One may have thought, “there <em>must</em> be a best way to do this.” Pondering such questions too deeply now appears to be a complete waste of time. The science is now here to support that it is impossible, for the time being, to figure out what works best for more than four or five spicy gingerbread men or Christmas tree cookies.</p>
<p>Assistant Professor Mikkel Abrahamsen of the Department of Computer Science and two research colleagues studied how difficult it is to figure out the optimal way to pack objects in two dimensions without overlap — a conundrum that computer scientists have plugged away at for decades.</p>
<p>"While algorithms let us solve seriously complex problems, this is one that remains too much of a mouthful for today’s computers. For now, it isn’t possible to pack more than 5-10 objects optimally. And, our result suggests that this number probably won’t increase much for the time being," explains Mikkel Abrahamsen.</p>
<p>Packing things optimally isn’t just an occasional problem at home, but in a variety of industries, including clothing manufacturing and metal processing. In each case, it is important to cut out materials with as little waste possible. In shipping, it applies to the packing of containers.</p>
<h2>Only four gingerbread cookies</h2>
<p>We know the size of the smallest square container in which we can pack up to 10 square 1x1 meter pallets. But by simply adding one additional pallet, it becomes impossible to calculate the optimal size of the container. Abrahamsen explains:</p>
<p>“As more pallets are added, the calculation time increases beyond exponentially. Not even the best computers can keep up. Theoretically it's possible. But based upon the speed at which computing power is growing, it will probably take millions of years before we are able to optimize the handling of a few additional objects."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, if one is working with more complicated shapes, like Christmas tree-shaped gingerbread, Mikkel Abrahamsen says that optimal solutions can only be found for up to four objects today.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="Left: Optimal packing of five squares. Right: The currently best known packing of eleven unit squares into a larger square." src="https://www.science.ku.dk/english/press/news/2020/the-ever-elusive-riddle-whats-the-best-way-to-cut-christmas-cookies/billedinformationer/Figur_2_1100.png">
<figcaption>Left: Optimal packing of five squares. Right: The currently best known packing of eleven unit squares into a larger square.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>An infinite number of options</h2>
<p>What makes it so difficult? Abrahamsen explains that the problem is similar to solving equations of degree five or higher, and with many unknowns. Here, it is known that such a solution cannot always be written down using regular arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>"Our study proves that the problem has a nature that we in mathematics refer to as continuous — which in a nutshell, means that one must know all of the coordinates at which the cookies can be placed and all of the angles at which they can be rotated," explains Abrahamsen.</p>
<p>As the possible combinations are infinite, there is no way to create a list of all the locations needed to try in order to find an optimal packing solution. Instead, algorithms that solve packing problems optimally need to be more analytical, which is time consuming. This contrasts with many other known algorithmic problems, where one can try a limited number of combinations before finding one that is optimal. Thus, packing problems are much more difficult.</p>
<p>So in practice, there are no better solutions to packing problems than the ones we humans can come up with.</p>
<p>"In both industry and over the kitchen counter we must continue to be satisfied with our less-than-optimal solutions and rest assured that we humans are still better than computers for these types of tasks — for the time being," concludes Mikkel Abrahamsen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Facts</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>In computer science and mathematics, packing problems are a class of optimization problems which involve attempting to pack a number of objects as closely as possible in either two or three dimensions. Mathematicians have been addressing packing problems for hundreds of years.</li>
<li>With the new result, the two-dimensional packing problem has graduated to a higher class of computational complexity, which is denoted ∃ℝ. It was previously believed that the question belonged to the class NP together with the famed "travelling salesman problem", which deals with calculating the shortest tour for visiting all cities on a given list.</li>
<li>The research was conducted by Mikkel Abrahamsen of the University of Copenhagen’s BARC Centre, at the Department of Computer Science; Tillmann Miltzow from Utrecht University in the Netherlands and Nadja Seiferth from Freie Universität Berlin in Germany. The research has received funding from the VILLUM Foundation, among others. </li>
<li>The study has been presented at the prestigious conference FOCS 2020 (IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science), running from 16-19 November. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07558">Read the article here.</a></li>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist.

When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
