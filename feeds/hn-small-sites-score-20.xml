<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I grew up programming on my TV, with a Sinclair ZX81 followed by a ZX Spectum. Computers built into keyboards, that you can easily plug into a TV, are part of my DNA. So, given this, how could I resist buying the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry Pi 400</a>!?</p>

<p>The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I like it :)</p>

<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz</li>
  <li>4GB LPDDR4-3200</li>
  <li>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN</li>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0, BLE</li>
  <li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
  <li>2 × USB 3.0</li>
  <li>1 × USB 2.0 ports</li>
  <li>Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header</li>
  <li>2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)</li>
  <li>MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage</li>
  <li>79-key compact keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>(full specs can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/">here</a>)</p>

<p>The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions-on-the-hardware">First Impressions on the Hardware</h2>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

<![CDATA[Go in Production – Lessons Learned]]>

<![CDATA[
Score 140 | Comments 70 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25012115">thread link</a>) | @tdom
<br/>
November 6, 2020 | https://tdom.dev/go-in-production | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tdom.dev/go-in-production">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got a DevOps job that mostly involves writing a new backend system in Go completely from scratch. Here's what I learned having never actually used it in production, knowing it mostly just from personal projects.</p>

<p>At the start, we decided to try simply sticking with Go's http library and a simple routing library - <code> mux</code>.</p>
<p>However, I quickly ran into real-life, production problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery middleware </strong> -  for logging &amp; silently handling panics in handler's code.</li>
<li><strong>Logging </strong> -  I wanted some solution that would print information about each request, including body params, auth tokens, etc. (for debugging purposes).</li>
<li><strong>Better error handling </strong> -  I wanted the errors to still be JSON responses with an error message and code.</li>
<li><strong>Other commonly-used middleware </strong> -  including JWT auth and CORS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two options; implement solutions to the above problems myself, use different 3rd party libraries for each problem, or pick a web framework that already does most (if not all) of these things.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to use the Echo web framework. With almost 20k GitHub stars, a pretty active community, and great documentation I thought it was a great tool for the job.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-site.png" alt="echo site"></p>
<p>I also found there to be a little less boilerplate when it comes to writing the apps in <code>echo</code> (mainly when parsing a json body, writing errors, and manually setting headers), leading to improved code readability.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-simple.png" alt="comparison"></p>
<p>However the real difference in productivity will be noticed when you have slightly more complex endpoints. You'll often run into cases where you need to validate certain JSON fields, and you'll want meaningful error messages describing what's wrong. If you want to do that without any library, your code will quickly become much harder to read:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-large.png" alt="comparison"></p>

<p>Go web frameworks (or go in general) don't enforce any particular file structure. If you ever used something like ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that some frameworks are tightly structured and many things are done implicitly by convention rather than explicitly specified.</p>
<p>The thing about Go is that it's really easy to skip learning about structuring your code and make it a hard to read+maintain mess. If you still don't know what I'm talking about, here's an example of a (<strong>bad</strong>) Go endpoint I wrote a while back:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/bad-good-structure.png" alt="bad code"></p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? It's quite likely that the in total the "better" way will contain more lines in total after adding all the <code>CreateUser</code> and <code>CreateAgency</code> methods, but… It will be much easier to understand, reuse, debug, and modify later on as each method will have a single purpose.
If you haven't already, I highly recommend you have a look at the following resources for a good code structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ribice/gorsk">https://github.com/ribice/gorsk</a> - nice example of a basic REST API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch">https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch</a> - also a REST API example, but more strictly following the "Clean Architecture" concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the concept is simple. You should separate the code that communicates with the database from the actual application logic itself, which should also stay separate from the transport/endpoint logic (in this example the HTTP endpoints).</p>

<p>When I first started programming in Go, I wanted to use the least libraries possible, so of course I opted in for using the <code>database/sql</code> package (with Postgres). Although the experience was OK, I came across quite a lot of boilerplate when querying data, especially having to use the Scan syntax.
This lead me to the following 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sqlx </code> -  a lightweight wrapper on top of <code>database/sql</code> with some extensions that will make querying much easier.</li>
<li><code>gorm </code> -  an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  library for Go, which generates SQL models and queries based on your Go models.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think there's a clear "better" library, in the end it comes down to the use case and preference.</p>
<p><code>gorm</code> will probably make your life easier, especially if you often forget to add fields to queries after altering the database (because in gorm you won't have to do that at all).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>sqlx</code> on the other hand is much more SQL centric, it's more like writing Go code to interface with SQL rather than gorm 's approach of generating SQL from Go code. It's nice if you prefer to have total control over your SQL and not having to learn new syntax of GORM.</p>

<p>One of the challenges I came across was configuring the project for production. There are always some differences between the dev and prod environments, such as what port the app should run on, the host and credentials for the database, and etc.</p>
<p>I've seen people configure their app variables via JSON, YAML, or even gitignored&nbsp;.go files. I personally found env files to work the best, especially with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-env.png" alt=".env">
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-compose.png" alt="docker-compose">
I usually combine these with the following utility functions:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/env-util.png" alt="Dockerfile">
Building the Docker image is also extremely easy in Go.:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/dockerfile.png" alt="Dockerfile"></p>

<p>There are also a few other things that came to my mind that I didn't consider worth their own sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/basics/7">Named returns in Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">Go Modules</a></li>

<p>There once was a society in which horizontal totalitarianism was so successful that, without any need for a State or institutions, simple social pressure from friends and neighbours was sufficient to conserve a culture and its customs, perhaps for over forty thousand years. One could even speculate that if Captain James Cook had not disembarked in Australia it may have lasted even longer. The indigenous people of this island-continent are suggestive of the power of horizontal totalitarianism as a form of organisation capable of formatting people so that practically any individual initiative that may alter traditional world-views and customs virtually disappears. Aboriginal Australians did not need to burn at the stake those who broke taboos or refused to respect and follow traditional rites. It was enough that their peers would exclude them from the community, and that they would then perish in the desert (see, for instance, Philip Clarke’s comprehensive anthropological history <em>Where the Ancestors Walked</em>, 2003).</p>



<p>In other societies, more technologically advanced and on the whole ideologically less monolithic, institutional repression has been necessary to eliminate ideologies and behaviours that diverge from horizontal totalitarian norms. In many places, professionalised clergy quickly assumed responsibility for fixing community laws and seeing that they were obeyed, using prosecution analogous to criminal trials against what was considered sinful conduct. These sins were widely understood as crimes against society, or rather, against the maintenance of totalitarian control over individual minds. This is the case, for example, of the ancient Hebrew priesthood, whose sentences were carried out collectively by the people through stoning, a fact that indicated that the punishment was not purely the responsibility of an authority that enforced its will from top to bottom, but also that of the neighbours and acquaintances of the sinner/offender. It was the community that took on and carried out the right to punish. Over time, the State increasingly assumed this power for itself, substituting a vertical order for the earlier horizontal one, which ultimately culminated in modern forms such as fascism and communism. Nowadays, aside from its use by the Cuban dictatorship for its own interests, as well as those who aspire to imitate it in other parts of Spanish-speaking Latin America, horizontal totalitarianism has lost its institutional power in almost all geographical locations and civilizations. This includes Australia, where the aboriginal people, like those of New Guinea, have had to accept modern respect for the individual and the separation, at least in theory, of church, State and ethnicity. However, this does not mean that horizontal totalitarianism is a thing of the ancient past. Even without an established institutional power, its social manifestations continue to oppress people in all too many places, and the modern Western world is no exception. In contrast to the vertical kind, horizontal totalitarianism does not by any means need to dominate public institutions in order to come into being, or to crush the individual, because it pre-dates and exists independently from these institutions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In fact, horizontal totalitarianism may also arise without availing itself of institutional agency, since it does not require any institutions in order to repress or eliminate dissidents. It is difficult to fight against this type of totalitarianism because anyone could be one of its agents and its workings can remain opaque even to those who enthusiastically practice it in their daily lives. Horizontal totalitarianism represents a totalitarianism exercised by the majority (or a dominant minority able to sway and manipulate a majority) of a given community by oppressing other members of that community who do not adhere to its unwritten rules. It oppresses minorities as well as those who are seen as disturbing or threatening the homogeneity of the community as a unique and complete entity. In horizontal totalitarianism, there is no need for external authorities to impose their will, against whom the community of the oppressed can, in turn, rebel. Since the majority, made up of oppressors and their conformist followers, and the minority of oppressed people live on the same social plane, the persecuted can hardly rely on the solidarity of their fellow dissidents because they find themselves isolated and disempowered among the mass of individuals who apply the unwritten laws of uniformity, and of the totalitarian unity of the community.</p>



<p>It may seem excessive to some to term this horizontal oppression ‘totalitarian’. However, its consequences for people and societies are even more serious than those of vertical totalitarianism. An incalculable number of people have died at the hands of their neighbours and countrymen since the beginning of time. How many Muslim women have been stoned to death by their neighbours for not adhering to their society’s sexual mores? How many Hindu men and women have been murdered by their relatives for daring to marry outside their caste? How many individuals have died for not believing in their tribe’s chosen god? How many have died for daring to question the beliefs and prejudices held by the majority of people in their community? And we are not talking about primitive societies here, nor solely those of the past. Today, homosexual people still commit suicide in communities where widespread homophobia turns their existence into a living hell. We still see people exiled or forced to seek asylum because they refused to partake in the religious or political ideas of their people, or because they do not belong to the predominant ethnicity or ideological affiliation of their region. Criticism, whether more or less open; social vacuums; and the impossibility of leading a life of one’s own, continue to hound all those who, for whatever reason, are seen as being <em>abnormal</em>.</p>



<p>Even our private lives are threatened, and not only by corrupt and opportunistic politicians who take advantage of people’s prejudices to limit minority rights and secure their own power. This power, built on populism, is but the political face of horizontal totalitarianism. Thanks to the development of the surveillance methods and mutual control structures offered by information technologies, before long we might begin to receive scores (c.f. China’s social credit system) and, consequently, punishments and rewards, based on our neighbours’ or communities’ opinions of us. No longer will anyone wish to be original, extravagant or creative, nor outspokenly contrarian, because this may cause that group of people who judge us with each passing moment to turn against us. This phenomenon can be observed in the actions of existing successful public silencing initiatives, which confront questions and divergent opinions with insults, as seen in the unfortunate social media lynchings perpetrated in recent years by fanaticised supporters of MeToo or Black Lives Matter, or by similar movements with equally extreme ideologies. While it is true that these phenomena are not new, in the past they were only dangerous once they crossed into the physical realm, when people became a policing mass, as explained by Gustave Le Bon in <em>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind </em>(<em>Psychologie des foules </em>1895). Thanks to current technologies and the eternal social instincts of the human being, the ‘mechanical solidarity’ of closed, traditional communities, as described by Émile Durkheim in <em>The Division of Labour in Society </em>(<em>De la division du travail social </em>1893), may even accumulate more repressive force today than it has already enjoyed for millennia.</p>



<p>The Internet has been and continues to be a powerful tool for unleashing self-expression and individual creativity. In theory, anyone can propose anything online, and by the same token, can oppose anything. Then again, it is important to ask oneself how many people might maintain their silence, or hide their convictions for fear of the aforementioned media lynchings. We are also aware of numerous children and adolescents who have committed suicide to escape cyberbullying perpetrated by their neighbours and classmates, for their apparent lack of conformity to some ideal or principle of normalcy prevalent at the time. For horizontal totalitarianism, social harassment is a powerful weapon that the Internet has not deactivated; one could even argue that its power has intensified, since the Internet makes it easy for the number of bullies to increase exponentially.</p>



<p>The danger appears even greater when taking into account that neither writers nor intellectuals wish to denounce it. On the contrary, the modern and postmodern idealisation of all manner of closed societies, from primitive tribes to rural villages, has inspired numerous texts precisely condemning that one place where the individual may, to an extent, escape horizontal totalitarianism. That is, the great modern city in which economic and political freedom prevail, as well as freedom to practice traditional customs. In the city, it is not possible for everyone to know and control you. Unlike the village or tribe, in which everyone knows everyone else, no one has any reason to know anything about you and thus you can carry on your life without fear of criticism or attacks from other members of the community. No one will disapprove of you because you do not attend mass or believe in the God or gods that the village or tribe dictates you should, make love in a way that is condemned by the ruling community’s morality, or fail to profess belief in your nationality being superior to that of foreigners. Aside from mandatory compliance with laws and the reciprocal respect essential to a peaceful coexistence, the individual is sovereign and is no longer a mere component of a mechanical social …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and The Cantos</em>, by Massimo Bacigalupo, Clemson University Press, 346 pp, £64, ISBN: 978-1949979008</p>
<p>Ezra Pound is, perhaps, the most troubling of all the Modernist presences in Anglophone literature – a fascist and an unrepentant antisemite even after the Holocaust revealed the ultimate end of that obnoxious prejudice – yet he was a brilliant poet, a brilliant synthesiser of cultures and absolutely central to Modernism in English. Born in Hailey, Idaho in 1885, he came to Europe in 1908, first to Gibraltar as a tour guide, later to Genoa and then to London, where he lived for ten years. During his stay there he made the acquaintance of all the Modernist poets and was, by the time he left for Paris and Italy, already a significant figure in that literary movement. He arrived in Rapallo, Italy, in 1924 and lived there until 1945, when he was forcibly repatriated to the USA to stand trial for his wartime collaboration with the Italian government. While in London he was a hugely influential editor and critic and his influence would be continued from his base in Italy. His role in the work of Eliot and Yeats, among many others, is well-known, as is his furious proselytising on behalf of James Joyce, who said of him: “It is probable that but for him I should still be the unknown drudge that he discovered.” Eliot, in dedicating “The Waste Land” to Pound, called him <em>il miglior fabbro</em> ‑ the best craftsman (a quotation from Dante).</p>
<p><em>Ezra Pound, Italy and the Cantos</em> comes from the pen of one of the foremost Pound critics. Massimo Bacigalupo grew up in Rapallo, Pound’s long-term home. His parents were friends of Pound’s and Bacigalupo himself would come to know him in what he calls his “complex and tormented final phase” in the postwar period when, as a broken man, he returned to his old ground. Besides literary criticism, Bacigalupo is an accomplished and multi-award-winning short-film-maker (the Turin Film festival dedicated a retrospective to his work in 2010) and many of the photographs included in the text are his; a prize-winning translator of, among others, Pound, Yeats and Wordsworth; and emeritus professor of Anglo-American literature at the University of Genoa. Bacigalupo’s personal relationship with the Pounds informs every aspect of his book and lends a more intimate air to his acute observations. </p>
<p>Had Pound, like Eliot, who was equally antisemitic and had fascist tendencies, confined himself to poetry we might remember him differently but it was his misfortune to fall under the spell of fascism and to be incapable of circumspection. Yeats, who admired the Blueshirts in Ireland, shared Pound’s contempt for democracy – indeed for the <em>demos</em> – his belief in an “aristocracy of the arts” and his contempt for the bourgeoisie. In the chaos that followed the First World War the idea of a political strongman was fatally attractive to many intellectuals. This is the context of Pound’s fascism, though I believe that antisemitism was the real poison in his blood. He correctly argued that “usury”, which we would call “finance capitalism”, would come to dominate Western society but believed it was a Jewish conspiracy and fascism was the cure. Not only does he argue that Jews are usurers but also very often the converse that financiers must be Jews, as in the case of the Scot John Law, who was controller general for France during the reign of Louis XIV. Pound calls him “Lawvi or Levi”, in other words, he guessed wrongly that Law was a cover for the Jewish name Levi – a classic antisemitic inductive error. He has the conspiracy theorist’s eye for detail, as well as his failure to grasp reality.</p>
<p>Pound’s biggest mistake was to make regular broadcasts for the fascist government of Italy during the war. These broadcasts, though never as targeted towards the Axis war effort as those of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw, who was eventually hanged by the British, were nevertheless rightly considered rank propaganda for an enemy power. Pound’s broadcasts mainly consisted of rambling attacks on “usury”, Jews and the United States as well as samples of his own poetry, but they were monitored in the USA and considered to be aimed at undermining morale. In 1943, he was indicted for treason <em>in absentia</em>. On capture he was detained in a “cage” in Pisa for some time and then repatriated to stand trial. Because of the influence of his friends he did not receive the death sentence but was committed to St Elizabeth’s Psychiatric Hospital near Washington, where he remained for thirteen years.</p>
<p>Bacigalupo does not shy away from what he calls “the Pound vortex”, which, he says, “must be acknowledged in all its bewildering violence and historical dimensions”. Strangely, it is the Italian writers of the postwar Left who were most forgiving of his wartime stance. Pier Paolo Pasolini, for example, perhaps the most ferocious of antifascist writers and <em>auteurs</em>, was an admirer and there is a brief account here of a gentle and supportive interview he conducted with the poet in his final years. Carlo Izzo was another – scholar and translator <em>extraordinaire</em> of among many others Liam O’Flaherty – Pound referred to him as “my best translator”. Remarkably, considering that Izzo was a communist and a committed antifascist who married a Jewish woman and whose position at the University of Bologna was cancelled under Mussolini’s Race Law, the two men continued to correspond throughout the war years. In 1958, Izzo wrote sadly of Pound:</p>
<p>That he could have identified his world-view with that horror of doctrines that are among the most inhuman of all time, does suggest mental aberration. To say to an Italian Jew, on the day that Italy passed the racial laws that are so alien to the spirit of our civilisation: ‘I am sorry, but it is well done,’ is the act of someone not in his right mind. Six million of those ‘I am sorry’ wouldn’t have saved one of the six million innocents who were ‘Liquidated’. I remember this incident without rancour …</p>
<p>Elsewhere he remarks, having listed Pound’s greetings to Venetian writers, several of whom were Jewish, that “Pound’s antisemitism was almost ludicrously theoretical”. In a valedictory piece after Pound’s death, Izzo wrote revealingly of their correspondence: “I cannot say that I ever had with Pound a real human relationship, since he was so remote from reality, and conversed in fragments, sometimes somewhat childishly.” The latter, I suspect, is a reference to the strange pastiche of Pound’s letter-writing, full of jokey attempts at demotic accents like Dickens on a bad day, and verbal ticks and wordplays and a random mix of languages. But, at the same time he wrote that “Pound was essentially … <em>il miglior fabbro</em>”,<em> </em>echoing Eliot’s “Waste Land” dedication.</p>
<p>Another Italian writer who admired and worked with Pound was Eugenio Montale, a Nobel Prize winner, born in Genoa. He lived a considerable part of his life just down the road from Rapallo at Monterosso in the Cinque Terre. But Montale did not follow him in his admiration for Mussolini nor his antisemitism (he was antifascist, had a Jewish lover and had many Jewish friends). Montale was an acute reader of poetry in English and grasped the beauty of Pound’s work. Bacigalupo devotes a chapter to the relationship. </p>
<p>Of the later <em>Cantos</em>, Montale wrote that they contained “a flood of haikus, that, should most of the poem be destroyed, would be the marvel of posterity”, but equally he could say, in an article on Pound’s release from St Elizabeth’s Hospital that Pound was “generous in helping the young of his generation, yet remained indifferent to the misery of a mass of innocents herded to the worst of deaths in the gas chambers”. He was amused by Pound’s lack of knowledge of the works he championed and translated, in particular his translation of Cavalcanti, which met widespread criticism. He understood too, that Pound collected bright objects from literature and history, polished them and placed them in contrapuntal dialogue, a form of homage to the original, but he did not necessarily understand the objects he selected. Pound’s Italian was not perfect and he knew almost nothing of the Oriental languages from which he “translated”; nevertheless, he often achieved an intense engagement with the poets which a better linguist might not have achieved. Bacigalupo maintains convincingly that though Pound had a profound influence upon Montale, turning him from the more conventional lyricism of his 1925 collection <em>Ossi di Seppia</em> (Cuttlefish Bones) to the more modernist 1939 volume <em>Le Occasioni</em> (The Occasions).</p>
<p>One of the delights of this study is what we might call the topographical analysis. The book falls fairly neatly into two parts – studies of the <em>Cantos</em> in relation to places and people, a sort of Baedeker to Pound’s inner geography, fittingly when we consider how Pound took Italy as the touchstone for the world. It is not so much that Pound is an Italophile, but that he saw the world by looking out from Italy, a world with Italy in the foreground. Montale himself noted Pound’s Italocentric <em>weltanschauung</em>: “Only in Rapallo, which he called ‘the world’s navel’ did he feel at home … He needed Italian pretexts.” Thus, the book begins and ends at the place closest to Pound’s ‑ and Bacigalupo’s – heart, the city and environs of Rapallo on the northwest Riviera coast of Italy, having strayed, in the meantime, to Venice and Rome and onwards. </p>
<p>Bacigalupo’s intimacy with the landscape in which the <em>Cantos</em> were composed is a delight. At the outset, he takes us on a walk from Pound’s seafront attic in Via Marsala to the village of Sant’Ambrogio on the slopes of Montallegro, following Pound’s daily itinerary from his home and wife (Dorothy Shakespear) to his lover Olga Rudge. From the attic he sees the sandboats run up on the beach at Rapallo: “the boats’ sails hung loose at the mooring, / cloud like a sail inverted / and the men dumping sand by the sea-wall”. On another occasion …</p></div></div>

<p>Nitro Enclaves provide isolated compute environments for secure processing of very sensitive data. In this article we will use Nitro Enclaves to build an extremely safe password storage mechanism.</p>
<p>Something was bugging me after publishing my recent articles about EC2 Nitro Enclaves (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">part 2</a>). It took me a few days until I realized what it was: aside from the ACM reference architecture I couldn’t come up with a valid use case for Nitro Enclaves. This left me wondering - are Nitro Enclaves a solution in search of a problem?</p>
<p>A couple of hours of sketching and thinking left me with a few infeasible or convoluted implementation ideas. But then it hit me. Nitro Enclaves can be used to provide a super secure password storage mechanism. At the end of this post we will have built a Nitro Enclave application that will protect user passwords, even when an attacker has full control over the application server and database. This Nitro Enclave application is called NitroPepper.</p>
<p><strong>[Update November 7th, 2020]</strong> An earlier version of this post used PBKDF2. That received some fair comments on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25010709">Hacker News</a>. PBKDF2 has now been replaced with bcrypt. The pull request for this replacement can be found <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app/pull/1/files">here</a>.</p>
<p>This article consists of three sections. Section 1 covers password storage mechanisms and explains the problem solved by NitroPepper. Section 2 covers the implementation details of NitroPepper. In section 3 we will walk through all the steps to get NitroPepper running on your own EC2 instances.</p>
<p>The NitroPepper architecture requires a few components, all of which we will discuss in depth in section 2. The components we use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple Python <strong>Flask frontend</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-demo-webapp">GitHub</a>) exposing two REST API methods: <code>new_user</code> and <code>login</code>. This frontend only serves demo purposes.</li>
<li>The <strong>NitroPepper application</strong> (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/nitropepper-enclave-app">GitHub</a>), written in Python, running in the Nitro Enclave.</li>
<li>The AWS <strong>Nitro Enclaves NSM API</strong>, extended with Python interfaces (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/donkersgoed/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api">GitHub</a>). This API provides an interface between NitroPepper and the Nitro Security Module (NSM).</li>
<li>A <strong>traffic forwarder</strong> to send KMS traffic from NitroPepper to KMS.</li>
<li>A <strong>KMS Proxy</strong> to send KMS traffic from the parent EC2 instance to KMS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Section 1: a brief history of password storage</h3>
<p>Any system with a user login requires some way to store a user’s password. Decades ago, it was acceptable to store passwords in plain text. But as more and more valuable data was stored online, people started attacking databases and extracting their contents. To protect against password leaks, gradually more sophisticated methods for storing passwords were developed. In this section we will briefly go trough the history of password storage.</p>
<p>If you’re already familiar with hashing algorithms, salt and pepper, feel free to skip this section and jump to the paragraph “The case for a unique pepper per user”.</p>
<p>One caveat: in the sections below I use MD5 as an example hashing mechanism. MD5 is known to be very insecure and you should never use it for real world password hashing. Instead, you would use SHA-512, SHA3 or another highly secure algorithm. The reason I use MD5 in this article is because its output is nice and short, which makes for easier reading.</p>
<h4>The olden days: plain text</h4>
<p>In an almost forgotten past, applications were not connected to the internet, databases were never attacked and passwords could be stored in plain text. A few rows in a user table might look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>Password</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>super_Secret1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>can’t_gues5_This</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>To log in to this system, the user provides their username and password to the application. The application checks if the username/password combination exists in the database. If the combination is found, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>As systems got more connected and accessible, database hacks and dumps also became more common. When an attacker would gain access to a database with passwords stored in plain text, they could use this information to log in as any user. To make matters worse, users commonly reuse passwords. This means that an attacker could use the passwords found at insecure site A to try a log in on another site B, even if this site did securely store their passwords.</p>
<h4>Replacing plain text passwords with hashes</h4>
<p>The first development to improve password storage security was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashing</a>. A hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA takes an input (in our case, the password) and generates a fixed-length string for this input. The algorithm is a mathematical operation that will always generate the same output for any given input. For example:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1) -&gt; bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76
MD5(can't_gues5_This) -&gt; fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880
</code></pre>
<p>The essence of a hash function is that it is one-directional. In other words, you can generate a hash from a password, but not a password from its hash. So if someone would gain access to the hash <code>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</code>, they wouldn’t know that the source password was <code>super_Secret1</code>.</p>
<p>An application built around this technology would no longer store plain text passwords, but store the hashed version instead:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>When a user logs in to this application they provide their username and plain text password. The application hashes the password at every login attempt and compares the result with the hash stored in the database. If they match, the user is allowed in.</p>
<p>With this solution the password is no longer stored in plain text. However, there are still significant weaknesses. The first is that some algorithms, like MD5 and SHA1, have been ‘broken’. When an algorithm has been broken, an attacker can independently generate an input string that results in the given hash. They can then use this input string as the password. Another problem is that the hash value will always be the same for a given password. An attacker can use this fact to build dictionaries or rainbow tables with the hash of common inputs and patterns. When they gain access to a database of hashes they only need to look them up in their dictionary to determine the original password.</p>
<h4>Adding salt to hashes</h4>
<p>The next generation of password security solves the problems of hashing by adding a <em>salt</em>. Why is this called a salt? Because salt goes well with hash. With <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a>, we still use a hashing algorithm, but instead of just hashing the plain password, we add a random string to the input. A few quick examples:</p>
<pre><code>MD5(super_Secret1-123455) -&gt; 8b7478c3ba06d3c5ed56754094ba5cd3
MD5(super_Secret1-669911) -&gt; c9037f7af3e52966f4766074b17c0b8c
MD5(can't_gues5_This-998765) -&gt; 337ef055ed6d3efd9d8d31a58d55bfab
</code></pre>
<p>This salt is stored with the user information in the database. Please note that a salt would in reality be a longer string with a larger character set.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>ID</th>
<th>Username</th>
<th>PasswordHash</th>
<th>PasswordSalt</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alice@example.net">alice@example.net</a></td>
<td>bd2bf17a10bc97a50bfb551aa2de9e76</td>
<td>123455</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:bob@example.net">bob@example.net</a></td>
<td>fda5a58b6772c04ea8e0aa6d0767d880</td>
<td>998765</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br>With a salt added to the password, two identical passwords (<code>super_Secret1</code>) become unique (<code>super_Secret1-123455</code> and <code>super_Secret1-669911</code>), which results in different hashes.</p>
<p>When logging in to this system, the user still provides their plain text password. The server then retrieves the salt from the database and performs the hash function: <code>MD5([password]-[salt])</code>. When the resulting hash matches the stored password hash, the user is allowed to log in.</p>
<p>With salt added to hashes, dictionaries and rainbow tables have become useless. Unfortunately, even this solution is not strong enough in a number of use cases.</p>
<h4>Adding a shared secret pepper</h4>
<p>In the solution above all information is stored in a single source - the database. If the attacker has access to the database and a known entry (for example their own username and password), they can attempt to retrieve the original values through brute force. This might take a while, but processing power becomes cheaper every year, and governments have access to supercomputers that might make breaking passwords easier than you might expect.</p>
<p>To be fair, a storage mechanism with properly salted passwords will be more than secure enough for most applications. But in healthcare, finance or government use cases, it might not be sufficient. This is where adding a server based pepper comes into play. Why is it called a pepper…? Well you get the point.</p>
<p>A shared secret pepper builds on the principle of the salt, but instead of storing the value in the database, it is stored on the server file system or another non-database system like AWS Secrets Manager. To be able to decrypt the passwords in the database the attacker needs access to both the database and secondary storage system, which significantly improves security. A simple SQL injection attack or access to a database backup is now no longer sufficient to attempt a brute force attack.</p>
<p>This time when a user attempts to log in, the application will hash the password + salt + pepper: <code>MD5([password]-[salt]-[pepper])</code>. When the result matches the password hash stored in the database, the user is allowed in.</p>
<h4>The case for a unique pepper per user</h4>
<p>The Wikipedia page for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">Pepper (cryptography)</a> states: “In the case of a shared-secret pepper, a single compromised password (via password reuse or other attack) along with a user’s salt can lead to an attack to discover the pepper, rendering it ineffective”. Additionally, a user, engineer or hacker  with access to a web server will likely have access to the database credentials and the shared secret pepper. If this person could exfiltrate the database and the shared secret pepper, the passwords can be brute-forced again.</p>
<p>The solution is to generate a pepper unique to every user. Of course, the salt is also unique to each user. The difference between the user salt and the unique user pepper is where they are stored. The salt is stored semi-publicly with the user’s hashed password, while the unique user pepper is stored on a separate medium, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM). The …</p></div></div>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>

<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

<p>The standard library contains a ton of code that we don’t want to write ourselves, including printf, scanf, math functions, and so forth. So, we need to make sure our operating system can link to this library and everything “just works”. This post will show you how I linked our operating system to a standard library, newlib, and the trials and tribulations encountered in doing so.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>



<p>Libraries allow programmers to start writing programs at a higher level. If anyone remembers back to the 80s where personal computers would boot to a BASIC editor, you essentially had to write your programs from scratch.</p>



<p>The term library just means some place to store code. Generally, this code is an object file of compiled and assembled source code. Shared objects can also be loaded <em>on-demand</em>, but this requires a little bit of extra support from a dynamic linker. See my post about dynamic linking here: <a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/2020/06/22/dynamic-linking/" data-type="post" data-id="407">Dynamic Linking</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="thelibrary">The Library</h2>



<p>Many of the most useful routines will be written once and then stored into either a <em>shared object</em> (so) or an archive (a). We know that libraries allow us to pull in already-written code, but there is a more fundamental reason for a library–to make interfacing with the operating system easy.</p>



<p>If you’ve read my blog posts on a RISC-V operating system using Rust, you will know how an application can make a request from the operating system itself. Generally, this is done through system calls. These system calls are given a number. For example, in Linux on an x86-64 system, system call #0 is the <em>exit</em> system call. However, nothing really says that we have to use these numbers.</p>



<p>If we take a look at libgloss, which is a low-level library written for newlib, we can see the following standard:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="" width="249" height="380" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 497w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px"><figcaption>libgloss syscall.h file</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="syscalls">System Calls</h2>



<p>So, as you can see, the job of a low-level library is to make sure the arguments are in the right location, the system call number is in the correct register, and that the system call is actually made. For RISC-V, the final instruction we execute is <em>ecall</em>, for “environment call”. This instruction will jump us into the operating system. The OS will handle this by first understanding that it is handling a system call. Second, it will look at the system call number and route it to the correct routine.</p>



<p>In my OS blog, you can see I do the same thing here: <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html">https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/ch7.html</a></p>



<p>We can see this in terms of a common function, such as printf(). This function will first use the application to form a full string. So, something like printf(“Hello %s”, “Stephen”) will cause the function to build a string that reads “Hello Stephen\0”. The final step is for printf() to print it to the <em>stdout</em> file handle. Barring any redirections, this is generally the console. So, the library function(s) must eventually call the <em>write</em> system call with the file descriptor (number) listed first, a pointer to the string second, and finally the number of bytes to write third.</p>



<p>At the end of a system call, control is handed back to the user application. In this case, printf() will have to handle whatever return value is received from the write system call. If we perform a system call trace, or strace, we can see that indeed <em>write</em> is the end goal for printf.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png" alt="" width="512" height="53" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x105.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x31.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x78.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<p>In the output above, we can see that printf() decided to call write with file descriptor 1, which is standard output, the string buffer “Hello Stephen”, which is lastly 13 characters. Notice that printf() must be able to find the NULL-terminator (\0) to count the number of <em>printing</em> characters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="our_kernel">Our Kernel</h2>



<p>When we look in our kernel, we have to be able to handle how the library makes the system call. As you can see, most of these system calls follow the UNIX SYSV convention, such as exit, read, write, and so forth, and where everything this a file descriptor, including network sockets and actual files.</p>



<p>The example below shows how I implemented the <em>open</em> system call. You can see that since the application is using virtual memory, I am required to find out where that is in physical memory so the kernel can go find it. Mixing the two or <em>crossing streams</em> is never a good idea.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png" alt="" width="768" height="460" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-1024x613.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-300x180.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-768x460.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6.png 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<p>In the code above, I check to see if the path given by the user (the first parameter) is somewhere in the virtual file system. If it is, then we can create a new file descriptor and link it to that file. As you can tell, this system call is by no means completely able to handle all of the different types of files out there, including nodes (sockets, fifos, etc).</p>

<h2 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h2>



<p>The C++ standard actually contains information about the standard library. This includes complexity guarantees and memory footprints.</p>



<p>The library would also be best to know about all of the exploits of the underlying architecture. For example, strcpy (string copy) can exploit the AVX or SSE extensions if the CPU supports them.</p>



<p>Looking at the C++ 2011 standard, which I found for free here <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf</a> outlines the different standard functions that need to be supported to be considered C++ standard.</p>



<p>Here’s just one example of the requirements for the container library on page 717 (731 is the PDF page).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png" alt="" width="768" height="363" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-1024x484.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-300x142.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-768x363.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7.png 1338w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>

<h2 id="starting_and_ending">Starting and Ending</h2>



<p>Another interesting part of libraries is that some portions of them can help the language function properly. These libraries are usually called <em>runtimes</em>. Most languages now have a runtime, which is code that is executed when the program runs, rather than when it is compiled or linked.</p>



<p>How many of you really knew that <em>int main</em> is not our real entry point for running a program? Instead, this belongs to a memory label called <em>_start</em>. This label is the ELF (executable and linkable format) entry point where the operating system will set your application to start running.</p>



<p>The _start will eventually call int main, but it has to set up some things include command line arguments, or at the very least putting them into the int argc, and char *argv[] parameters.</p>



<p>We can see the _start routines in the crt0.S assembly file, which stands for C-runtime. The 0 is the first runtime, as more runtimes can be added in different files, such as crt1.S and so forth.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-987x1024.png" alt="" width="494" height="512" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-987x1024.png 987w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-289x300.png 289w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-768x797.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2.png 1254w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px"><figcaption>The _start routine</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<p>You can see in the code above, before main is even called, the BSS (uninitialized global variables) is cleared to 0, the global pointer (gp) is set, and the atexit functions (global termination functions) are registered. Finally, argc, argv, and envp all get their proper locations. For RISC-V, this is a0, a1, and a2.</p>



<p>You can see that the last thing to occur is the exit call. This will take the return value of main, which will be in the register a0. The <em>tail</em> instruction means that it will not return. Both call and tail are pseudo-instructions in RISC-V, which can be seen in the RISC-V specification:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x122.png" alt="" width="768" height="92" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x122.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-300x36.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-768x92.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>tail writes the return address to the zero register, effectively discarding it.</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr>



<h2 id="dynlink">Handling Dynamic Linking</h2>



<p>Dynamic linking requires us to parse the executable and linkable format (ELF) a little bit more robustly than we did in our <a href="https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/">RISC-V OS in Rust</a>. The dynamic linker requires an executable <em>interpreter</em> that lives somewhere on the storage device. You can actually look at an executable file to see what interpreter it will request when those dynamically-linked functions are called.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png" alt="" width="768" height="118" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x157.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-300x46.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-768x118.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1536x236.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4.png 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>readelf -l myexec</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can see the executable file above is going to use /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 to run this simple test executable that I compiled. We can actually run that interpreter and see what it says:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="260" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x347.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x102.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x260.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1685w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Invoking the dynamic linker directly</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, the INTERP is a particular program header that our operating system would have to be able to handle and spawn a thread to the dynamic linker. However, this was way more than our custom operating system could handle. So now, our operating system will require that the standard library be statically linked into our program. This means that all of the functions and routines that are needed by the program will have to be stored in the executable. This significantly increases the size of our program depending on the number of library function calls made in the lifetime of the executable.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>I haven’t even begun to dive deeply at all that goes into designing and creating a library. In my software engineering courses, I show that libraries can be a great tool to aggregate many different teams’ code into a single project. Keep in mind that I’m looking at this with a fairly low-level lens.</p>



<p>Most libraries have a particular architecture and operating system in mind. This leads to some challenges with a custom OS. In fact, more often than not, I ended up copying Linux’s conventions just to avoid pain later. In the grand scheme of things, this might not seem to be a big deal. However, it forces you to think a certain way about an operating system.</p>



<p>Getting a big philosophical–Linux has changed over the years, but it still has a core philosophy. Many operating systems that were derived from it, including Android, are now being rendered obsolete for a new, refreshing look at operating systems. In fact, Google has started the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started">Fuchsia project</a>, which aims to build a modular operating system to replace Android in its mobile devices.</p>

<p>HP never stopped innovating. From its origins in the 1930s as a leading electronics manufacturer to its role in the birth of PCs and performance servers, it has always demonstrated incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>Today, that ingenuity is deployed in service of evil ink-based fuckery.</p>
<p>The printer-ink business model has always been a form of commercial sadism in which you are expected to put giant manufacturers' interests ahead of your own with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>After all, when your profits depend on charging more for ink than vintage Veuve-Clicquot, you need to get up to some serious shenanigans to get your customers to drain their bank accounts to fill their printers.</p>
<p>By contemporary standards, the opening hostilities in the ink-wars look positively quaint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing special half-full cartridges to ship with new printers so their owners have to buy a new set just days after the open the box
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring frequent "calibration" printouts that use vast amounts of ink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gimmicking cartridges' sensors to declare them "empty" even when there's still ink in them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing is, all of this just makes official printer ink less desirable and fuels demand for third party ink.</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to win a two-front war: one on your customers and the other on your competitors. HP is fighting both.</p>
<p>First they pioneered the use of DRM to detect and prevent third-party ink.</p>
<p>Then when ink makers started making their own chips, or harvesting chips out of discarded cartridges to use in new ones, HP got US customs to seize the product, calling it a patent infringement.</p>
<p>But the real ugliness started in March 2016, when HP pushed out a fake "security update" for inkjet printers. Owners who ran the update saw nothing, just a software version number that went up by one.</p>
<p>What they didn't know was that they've been given an asymptomatic infection – a malicious update that only kicked in five months later, after everyone had had a good long time to update. That update's real purpose was to detect and reject third party ink.</p>
<p>It went off right after school started, stranding cash-strapped parents with a year's worth of ink for their kids' school projects. People were outraged. HP issued a nonpology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers</a></p>
<p>(One year later, they did it again)</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739">https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739</a></p>
<p>Every time HP got caught doing something evil, they had the same excuse: "that's the deal we offered and you accepted it."</p>
<p>For example, if the box says "Works best with HP ink," then you are "agreeing" that it might not work with other ink. Nevermind that the only reason your printer doesn't work with other ink is that HP tricked you into downgrading it so that the ink stopped working.</p>
<p>This is the grifter's all-purpose excuse: "If you didn't want me to rip you off, then why did you click 'I agree'?"</p>
<p>HP was just getting started, though. In the ideal world, you wouldn't even own your printer ink, you'd just <em>rent</em> it.</p>
<p>Enter HP Instant Ink.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650</a></p>
<p>This  is "ink as a service." You pre-commit to printing a certain number of pages/month and they mail you ink, which they own. You're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use it.</p>
<p>If you don't print your quota in a month, some of the pages roll over, but they don't let you bank more than a few months' worth – and to keep those pages, you have to keep paying for your sub. Meanwhile, if you blow through your limit, you get charged for every page.</p>
<p>This is a weird and unpalatable idea, so to sell it, HP rolled out a pay-on-price "Free Ink for Life" plan that gave you 15 pages every month for as long as you owned your printer.</p>

<p>But this is HP we're talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its "free ink for life" customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99/month, forever, or else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>This Darth Vader "Pray I don't alter it further" shit is the most on-brand HP thing ever</p>
<p>Worse still are the many imitators HP inspires – all those companies that have decided that it's your solemn duty to arrange your affairs to suit their shareholders' needs.</p>
<p>The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.</p>
<p>Since the turn of this century, HP has been shedding its productive business units that make useful products, and focusing its legal and engineering departments on innovations in shitty dystopian hack-futurism.</p>

Which language should you choose for your next project, and why? How do the two compare in areas like performance, simplicity, safety, features, scale, and concurrency? What do they have in common, and where do they fundamentally differ? Let's find out, in this friendly and even-handed comparison of Rust and Golang, from the author of the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/">For the Love of Go</a> book series.</p>
<h2 id="rust-and-go-are-both-awesome">Rust and Go are both awesome</h2>
<p>First, it's really important to say that <em>both Go and Rust are absolutely excellent programming languages</em>. They're modern, powerful, widely-adopted, and offer excellent performance. You may have read articles and blog posts aiming to convince you that Go is better than Rust, or vice versa. But that really makes no sense; every programming language represents a set of trade-offs. Each language is optimised for different things, so your choice of language should be determined by what suits you and the problems you want to solve with it.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to give a brief overview of where I think Go is the ideal choice, and where I think Rust is a better alternative. Ideally, though, you should have a working familiarity with both languages. While they're very different in syntax and style, both Rust and Go are first-class tools for building software. With that said, let's take a closer look at the two languages.</p>
<h2 id="the-similarities">The similarities</h2>
<p>Rust and Go have a lot in common, which is one reason you often hear them mentioned together. What are some of the common goals of both languages?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a low-level statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language that’s focused on safety and performance.<br>
—<a href="https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide">Gints Dreimanis</a></p>
<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.<br>
—<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="memory-safety">Memory safety</h3>
<p>Both Go and Rust belong to the group of modern programming languages whose priority is <em>memory safety</em>. It's become clear over many decades of using older languages such as C and C++ that one of the biggest causes of bugs and security vulnerabilities is accessing memory unsafely or incorrectly. Rust and Go deal with this problem in different ways, but both aim to be smarter and safer than other languages about managing memory, and to help you write correct and performant programs. </p>
<h3 id="fast-compact-executables">Fast, compact executables</h3>
<p>They're both compiled languages, which means your programs are translated directly to executable machine code, so that you can deploy your program as a single binary file; unlike interpreted languages such as <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/golang/go-vs-python">Python</a> and Ruby, you don't need to distribute an interpreter and lots of libraries and dependencies along with your program, which is a big plus. This also makes both Rust and Go programs extremely fast in comparison to interpreted languages.</p>
<h3 id="general-purpose-languages">General-purpose languages</h3>
<p>Rust and Go are also both powerful, scalable general-purpose programming languages, which you can use to develop all kinds of modern software, from web applications to distributed microservices, or from embedded microcontrollers to mobile apps. Both have excellent standard libraries and a thriving third-party ecosystem, as well as great commercial support and a large user base. They've both been around for many years, and will continue to be widely used for years to come. Learning either Go or Rust today will be a sound investment of your time and effort.</p>
<h3 id="pragmatic-programming-style">Pragmatic programming style</h3>
<p>Neither are primarily functional languages (like Scala or Elixir, for example), and neither are exclusively object-oriented (like Java and C#). Instead, while both Go and Rust have features associated with functional and object-oriented programming, they're pragmatic languages aimed at solving problems in whatever way is most appropriate, rather than forcing you into a particular way of doing things. (If you like the functional style of programming, though, you’ll find a lot more facilities for it in Rust, because Rust <em>has</em> a lot more facilities than Go in general.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can debate about what an ‘object-oriented’ language is, but it’s fair to say that the <em>style</em> of object-oriented programming that C++, Java, or C# users would expect is not present in either Go or Rust.<br>
—Jack Mott</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="development-at-scale">Development at scale</h3>
<p>Both Rust and Go have some useful features which make them suitable for programming in the large, whether that means large teams, or large codebases, or both.</p>
<p>For example, whereas C programmers have argued for years about where to put their brackets, and whether code should be indented with tabs or spaces, both Rust and Go eliminate such issues completely by using a standard formatting tool (<code>gofmt</code> for Go, <code>rustfmt</code> for Rust) which rewrites your code automatically using the canonical style. It’s not that this particular style is so wonderful in itself: it’s the <em>standardisation</em> which Rust and Go programmers appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>gofmt</code>’s style is no one’s favourite, yet <code>gofmt</code> is everyone’s favourite.<br>
—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=8m43s">Rob Pike</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another area where both languages score highly is in the build pipeline. Both have excellent, built-in, high-performance standard build and dependency management tools; no more wrestling with complex third-party build systems and having to learn a new one every couple of years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building Go and Rust code, having come from a Java and Ruby background in my early career, felt like an impossible weight off my shoulders. When I was at Google, it was a relief to come across a service that was written in Go, because I knew it would be easy to build and run. This has also been true of Rust, though I've only worked on that at much smaller scale. I'm hoping that the days of infinitely configurable build systems are dead, and languages all ship with their own purpose-built build tools that just work out of the box.<br>
—<a href="https://samwho.dev/">Sam Rose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-s-all-the-fuss-about-">So what’s all the fuss about?</h2>
<p>With all that in mind, and seeing that both languages are so well-designed and powerful, you might be wondering what all the holy wars are about (me too). Why do people make such a fuss about 'Go versus Rust', getting into angry social media spats and writing long blog posts about how only an idiot would use Rust, or that Go isn't a real programming language, or whatever. It might make them feel better, but it doesn't exactly help you, as someone trying to decide which language to use for your project, or which you should learn to advance your programming career. A wise person doesn't make important choices based on who shouts the loudest.</p>
<p>Let's continue our grown-up discussion now by looking at some areas where a reasonable person might prefer one language over the other.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>We've said that both Go and Rust produce extremely fast programs because they're compiled to native machine code, without having to go through an interpreter or virtual machine. However, Rust's performance is particularly outstanding. It's comparable with C and C++, which are often regarded as the highest-performance compiled languages, but unlike these older languages, it also offers memory safety and concurrency safety at essentially no cost in execution speed. Rust also allows you to create complex abstractions without paying a performance penalty at run-time.</p>
<p>By comparison, although Go programs also perform extremely well, Go is primarily designed for speed of <em>development</em> (including compilation), rather than speed of execution. The Go compiler doesn’t spend a lot of time trying to generate the most efficient possible machine code; it cares more about compiling lots of code quickly. So Rust will usually beat Go in run-time benchmarks.</p>
<p>Rust’s run-time performance is also consistent and predictable, because it doesn’t use garbage collection. Go’s garbage collector is very efficient, and it’s optimised to make its stop-the-world pauses as short as possible (and getting shorter with every new Go release). But garbage collection inevitably introduces some unpredictability in the way programs behave, which can be a serious issue in some applications, such as embedded systems.</p>
<p>Because Rust aims to give the programmer complete control of the underlying hardware, it's possible to optimise Rust programs to be pretty close to the maximum theoretical performance of the machine. This makes Rust an excellent choice for areas where speed of execution beats all other considerations, such as game programming, operating system kernels, web browser components, and real-time control systems.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter how fast a programming language is if nobody can figure out how to use it. Go was deliberately conceived as a reaction against the ever-growing complexity of languages like C++; it has very little syntax, very few keywords, and, indeed, few features. This means it doesn't take long to learn the Go language to the point where you can write useful programs in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is incredibly easy to learn. I know this is an often-touted benefit, but I was really surprised at how quickly I was able to be productive. Thanks to the language, docs, and tools, I was writing interesting, committable code after literally two days.<br>
—<a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/early-impressions-of-go-from-a-rust-programmer-f4fd1074c410">Early Impressions of Go From a Rust Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word here is <em>simplicity</em>. Simple isn't the same as easy, for sure, but a small, simple language is easier to learn than a large, complex one. There just aren't that many different ways to do things, so all well-written Go code tends to look the same. It’s easy to just dive into an unfamiliar service and understand what it’s doing.</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println("Gopher's Diner Breakfast Menu")
for dish, price := range menu {
    fmt.Println(dish, price)
}</code></pre>
<p>Although the core language is small, Go’s standard library is very powerful. That means your learning curve will also need to include the parts of the standard library that you need, not just Go syntax. On the other hand, moving functionality out of the language and into the standard library means that you can focus on learning only the libraries that are relevant to you right now.</p>
<p>Go is also designed for software development at scale, with large codebases and large teams. In these situations, …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I heard before that Erlang and the BEAM did not pack a static type system
because their creators <em>“couldn’t build it”</em>.</p>
<p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>While building a sophisticated, reliable and scalable type checker is
absolutely not a walk in the park, building one that works is not that hard.</p>
<p>If it could have been done, it would’ve been done, and it would’ve been
hardened by the same process OTP was hardened and turned into what it is today:
a reliability gold standard.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an Erlang type-checker to really understand what is hard
about typing Erlang. I know Dialyzer exists, and its great, I just wanted to
get a good understanding from scratch.</p>
<p>It hit me that there is a split in here, that is sometimes hard to notice and
it makes a world of a difference. There is <strong>an Erlang language</strong>, called
Standard Erlang, and there is <strong>an Erlang Runtime</strong>, the BEAM. Along the same
lines as there is a Java language, and then there’s the JVM.</p>
<p>We tend to speak of these 2 things as if they were one, but if we isolate the
language from the runtime, we find that they exhibit very different behaviors.</p>
<p>In particular the runtime brings to the table <em>distribution</em> and  <em>hot code
reloading</em>, which makes typing things a distributed-systems problem. Fun, yes,
but very impractical.</p>
<p>On following essays I’ll do a more thorough and formal treatise of the
operational semantics of the language and how to go about implementing your own
type-checker for it, the distributed and dynamic nature of the runtime, and how
they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Here I’ll go over what I’ve learned takes to type the Standard Erlang in a more
superficial way, and what are some thorny parts that we will encounter.</p>
<p>First, lets scope what actually <em>is</em> Standard Erlang.</p>
<h2>Standard Erlang</h2>
<p>Erlang is a dynamically, strongly typed language. It includes just a little
extra over your typical functional programming language. Overall, Erlang isn’t
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl">that big a
language</a>.</p>
<p>My eye-ball estimation is that it is about a 3rd of the size of OCaml, and
about a 5th of the size of Java.</p>
<p>Here’s some Erlang:</p>
<pre><code>% an erlang module
-module(hello_world).

-export([hi/1]).  % &lt;-- this a compiler annotation

hi(noone) -&gt; sad;
hi(Name) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"Hello, ", (Name)/binary, "!"&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>An Erlang program consists of a number of <code>modules</code>, each module is just a file
with a bunch of <code>functions</code> in it and a few <code>annotations</code> used to tell the
compiler what’s exported, who the module author is, what a function type is
supposed to be, etc.</p>
<p>There’s quite a few things you can write in Erlang that are relatively common:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals like booleans, numbers or strings</li>
<li>lists, maps, tuples, lambdas</li>
<li>ifs, try/catch, case</li>
<li>function calls and references</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s a few things that aren’t common at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>atoms, which are just constants</li>
<li>receive expressions</li>
<li>all sorts of pattern matching</li>
<li>everything is done through recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, the language expressivity comes from it being rather simple.
Most problems are solved by making functions that call each other, most
functions pattern match on exactly the data they need, loops are achieved
through recursion, and we’re done.</p>
<p>Exceptions are very common, since failing to pattern match will result in an
exception. For this the language supports the <code>catch</code>, and <code>try..catch..after</code>
expressions, but it is highly unidiomatic to use them.</p>
<p>The superb uptime through supervision that Erlang is known for is actually
baked into the runtime, not the language. The language itself has no notion of
processes, links, or sending messages. The only thing it does have is <em>receive</em>
expressions for <em>consuming messages</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding, lets dig into how we could type Erlang.</p>
<h2>Typing the Erlang Language</h2>
<p>In writing the type-checker, I’ve found a few things that are worth bringing up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions on Untagged Unions</li>
<li>Functions on Records</li>
<li>Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</li>
<li>Receive Expressions</li>
<li>Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other language constructs that are not friendly to static
analysis. I’ll try to write and cover more in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Functions on Untagged Unions</h3>
<p>An Erlang value can have a single type but we expect that type to be known only
at runtime. This means that both the input and returning types of a function
are actually unknown <em>until</em> we run the function.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a function like <code>hi/1</code> above, calling it could actually
return a value of different types, depending on how the function was written.</p>
<p>For example, calling <code>hi(noone)</code> returns the atom <code>sad</code>. Instead, calling
<code>hi(&lt;&lt;"Joe"&gt;&gt;)</code> returns the string <code>&lt;&lt;"Hello, Joe!"&gt;&gt;</code>. The atom <code>sad</code> and the
string have different types. Calling <code>hi(0)</code> will result in an exception.</p>
<p>If we were to write down the type of this function we’d have to say something
like:</p>
<pre><code>hi(atom("noone") | string) -&gt; atom("sad") | string
</code></pre>
<p>This is present in every other dynamic language: Lisp, Lua, Javascript, Python,
Ruby, Smalltalk, you name it.</p>
<p>Writing a type-checker that deals with this is certainly possible, as it has
been done before in tools like <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/flow-type">Flow</a> and <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/typescript">TypeScript</a>,
but it certainly isn’t obvious how to.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can be dealt with, we need to talk about <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/union-types">Union
Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Union types</strong> allow us to express that a value may belong to one of many
different types at the same time. E.g, <code>1</code> is a <code>number</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>. In the same way, <code>true</code> is a <code>bool</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>.</p>
<p>We read <code>(number | bool)</code> as “number or bool”.</p>
<p>The key here is that the value itself doesn’t have explicit information about
which type from the union it actually belongs to, and we’re bound to find this
out through <em>refinements</em>.</p>
<p>We can do these refinements in 2 ways through the use of guards and pattern
matching.</p>

<p><strong>Through the use of guards</strong> we can refine the actual type of a value into a
single type. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% the infamous left_pad function
left_pad(A, B) when is_binary(A) -&gt; &lt;&lt;(A)/binary, (B)/binary&gt;&gt;;
left_pad(A, B) when is_number(A) -&gt; left_pad(binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A), B).
</code></pre>
<p>This function is has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>left_pad( string | number, string ) -&gt; string
</code></pre>
<p>But it is thanks to the guards <code>is_binary/1</code> and <code>is_number/1</code> that we <em>refine</em>
the type of the inputs to be just <code>string</code> or just <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to say that <code>binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A)</code> is safe, because
at that point we know that <code>is_number(A)</code> was true, and so <code>A</code>’s type has been
refined from <code>string | number</code> to just <code>number</code>. Otherwise the guard would have
been false.</p>
<p>However, we can’t use any function as a guard. We must use only built-in
functions that already come with the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to write arbitrary refinement logic, which makes the
approach rather limited.</p>

<p><strong>Through pattern matching</strong> we can do something very similar, and establish
our expectations of the values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% a good old list length counter
count(A=[_|_]) -&gt; count(A, 0).

count([], C) -&gt; C;
count([_|T], C) -&gt; count(T, C+1).
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are guaranteed that if our function pattern matches, then <code>A</code>
will be a list.</p>
<p>We don’t really know what the list elements are, but of course we can try and
continue pattern matching and using guards until we refine it “enough”.</p>
<p>These two approaches, while composable, have the unfortunate property that they
don’t generalize to all kinds of data. They should work well tho for: atoms,
literals, and anything that there is a guard available for.</p>
<p>Anything where our data is one of type <em>or</em> another, would fall into this
category.</p>
<p>Maps, tuples, and records can work with this, but it doesn’t scale very well.
You essentially have to add the new map/tuple/record name to the union every
time you want it supported. Even if you need a single field out of them.</p>
<p>In the next section we’ll see a different approach for dealing with this data
that scales much better.</p>
<h3>2. Functions on Record Types</h3>
<p>When working with functions that take as inputs many values packed into one, be
it with records, maps, or tuples, we’re faced with a different issue: we don’t
care what the input type is <em>as long as it has what we need in it</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have two possible maps that share some things, both of them
could be thought of as their own separate type, and these 2 types would have
something in common.</p>
<pre><code>% this has type 'character'
Character = #{ name =&gt; "Alexander Hamilton", play =&gt; "Hamilton" }.

% this has type 'performer'
Performer = #{ name =&gt; "Lin-Manuel Miranda" }.
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make a function to get the name of a Performer:</p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name := Name }) -&gt; Name.
</code></pre>
<p>and we give it a type:</p>
<pre><code>name(performer) -&gt; string.
</code></pre>
<p>Would we expect this function to work on Characters?</p>
<p>My answer is yes, since Characters also have a <code>name</code> fields.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d say that it will work just fine for any map <em>as long as it has a
name key that is a string</em>.</p>
<p>So the type of our function isn’t quite <code>(character | performer)</code>. It actually
is “Any map as long as it has a name key that is a string”. I’ll use this
notation for that: <code>#{ name }</code></p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name : A }) -&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>Some type-systems support this with Structural Subtyping, some others use Row
Polymorphism. The main difference isn’t obvious in this getter function, but
becomes obvious in the next one, a setter:</p>
<pre><code>with_name(Name, M=#{ name := _ }) -&gt; M#{ name =&gt; Name }.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The structural subtyping approach</strong> would say that whatever you put in, it is
now known to only have a <code>name</code> key. So all your other keys have disappeared
(to the eyes of the type-system) and if you want to recover them you have to do
some sort of casting. This is due to a subtyping behavior called <em>subsumption</em>
and its the way that TypeScript handles this.</p>
<p><strong>The row polymorphic approach</strong> has no information loss, and instead carries
around the rest of the fields that <code>M</code> had. This is how OCaml and PureScript
handles this. In PureScript this works for record types and in OCaml this is</p></section></section></div>

<p><strong>4 November 2020 | Luis F. De Pombo, David Ellis</strong></p>
<p>Can we write programs with predictable execution that could be automatically parallelized? Part of the work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a> demonstrated that for some programs it cannot be determined ahead of time whether or not the program can be computed. This constitutes the crux of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>. This "Turing-Completeness Problem" is not an issue with what they have shown, but how the software development process is hindered by the lack of assurances on computability and our industry's lack of recognition of the burden this has put onto software developers. Further, it has been exacerbated by recent computing mechanisms, such as multithreading, NUMA, GPGPU, and distributed computing, which have moved away from the "single tape" Turing Machine model of computation that most programming languages are founded upon.</p>
<p>The following snippet of C code succinctly contains the problems of Turing completeness complicating modern development:</p>
<pre><code>while (node) {
  doSomethingWith(node);
  node = node-&gt;next;
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><em>Automatic Parallelization</em> - It's not possible to automatically parallelize this code. The number of nodes is not clear to the compiler for it to potentially bunch those calls across threads, and it's also unclear if the function call mutates the node and adds/removes nodes to process.</li>
<li><em>Halting Problem</em> - It's not possible to know if the code will halt, even ignoring the idea that <code>doSomethingWith</code> may always add a new <code>node</code> to the one it is processing, there's nothing stopping a node from pointing at itself and never halting that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automatic parallelization is only a problem because we want/need to parallelize our code. Until very recently this was a niche need as <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2015/06/40-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/">computing power had been increasing exponentially for decades and has only flattened in the past decade</a>. If this was still the case it is likely that it would have remained a niche problem that only experts need to worry about, but with multicore now the norm even in personal laptops and unlikely to go away as <a href="http://www.fisgeo.unipg.it/luca.gammaitoni/fisinfo/documenti-fisici/physical-limits-silicon.pdf">signal propagation itself becomes the limiting factor</a>, it has become a problem for the average developer, as well.</p>
<p>The issue with the Halting Problem itself is much more contentious. Turing demonstrated that it is not possible to determine whether arbitrary compute will halt or run forever so this lack of determinism has been tolerated as an unfortunate reality of all compute that must simply be dealt with. However, we posit that no <em>practially useful</em> computation will take forever because its result cannot affect the finite reality of our lives, so programmers have already been finding an imperfect subset of Turing completeness for their own problem domains in an ad-hoc intuitive sense to be able to actually produce valuable calculations for their users.</p>
<p>In a single-threaded world, this problem has been mostly a small annoyance -- on those occasions where you have written infinitely-looping code, find the section of code that the processor is executing over and over again, study how it entered this state, and figure out how to prevent that state from occurring again -- or abort on detection of said state. But in a multi-threaded, multi-machined cluster computing world, on those occasions where you have written an infinite loop, even detecting an infinite loop that spans multiple machines is a challenge, let alone gathering the data you need to debug the cause of this invalid state. This is further exacerbated by the non-determinism inherent to multiple interacting Turing machines not executing in lockstep with each other making reproduction of the problem even more difficult.</p>
<p>Side-stepping the Halting Problem by defining a barely-Turing-incomplete subset, also makes the automatic parallelization story possible. Now the compiler can work with code that it can determine where and how it could parallelize the work and has the ability to model its finite execution time to determine whether or not parallelization is worth it under various conditions.</p>
<p>This is the thesis of <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">the Alan programming language</a>, that with minor syntax constraints (that we believe the vast majority of developers will not notice, or at least won't mind) we can be sure that the code you write always halts, and we can parallelize your code for you. We can make models for runtime estimates at compile time that only require the size and "shape" of the data to get an answer and can therefore determine not only how to parallelize your code, but whether or not it makes sense given the data being operated on. We have not yet accomplished all of these claims, but this is now only a matter of time and effort. :)</p>
<p>The root of most of the problems with the example C code involves the ambiguity in the data structure and the behavior of the user-defined function. The other problem is that the while loop is an unbounded looping construct that cannot be reasoned about except "the body of the while loop is executed zero or more times." In Alan, <em>arbitrary</em> looping and recursion are disallowed, and all data is built on top of data types with knowable constraints, no arbitrary JUMP statements or data pointer logic allowed.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that instead of writing that while loop above for your list of nodes, you would write something like:</p>
<pre><code>nodes.each(doSomethingWith)
</code></pre>
<p>Your intent to perform a side-effect action on each of the nodes in the list is clear, and the Alan compiler can determine the "purity" of the function -- whether or not it mutates the input argument or an outer scope -- to determine if it <em>could</em> execute the operations in parallel. Then at runtime it can use the estimated execution time of the function, the number of nodes in the <code>nodes</code> array, and the cost to distribute that work across multiple threads, to decide <em>if</em> it will execute the operations in parallel.</p>
<p>This can even apply across simple sequentially-written lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>fn example(file1: string, file2: string): Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; {
  const matrix1 = loadFile(file1).parseMatrix()
  const matrix2 = loadFile(file2).parseMatrix()
  return matrix1 * matrix2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is the matrix multiplication a trivially parallelizable operation that likely will be parallelized for any large-ish matrix, but reading the files from disk and then parsing their contents may be done in parallel before the matrix multiplication because the performance benefit is there to do so.</p>
<p>To accomplish automatic parallelization, we need something different from a classic Turing tape to compile to. We call this the Alan Graphcode: a bytecode format with graph annotations that is guaranteed to have no cycles. A dependency graph of operations to perform, with some of these also having a subgraph of operations to perform, provides us with the information we need to know which operations are safe to execute in parallel, coupled with (implied) operation execution time estimates to determine if it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>Alan's acyclic graphcode seems incompatible with any sort of control flow at first glance, though, since a dependency graph of operations that must all be executed appears to preclude the behavior of <code>JUMP</code> operations, like the classic <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/jnz">JNZ (Jump if Not Zero)</a>. <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">Alan</a> allows <code>if</code> statements and even <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/std_seq.html">guaranteed halting versions of classic looping constructs are in a standard library</a> that provide a predictable "worst case" execution time based on a maximum iteration count allowed. We will demonstrate how Alan allows control flow with a graph-based representation that makes automatic parallelization possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-tape.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ"></p>
<p>Here two operations <code>OP1</code> and <code>OP2</code> run, then a <code>JNZ</code> runs. If the check is not zero, it skips to only run <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>, otherwise it runs <code>OP3</code> and <code>OP4</code> before running <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>.</p>
<p>This is a basic if statement for something like:</p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
if (b) {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
}
var d = op5(a);
return op6(d);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent representation in a graph would be something like:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-if.png" alt="Graph Example with if"></p>
<p>Here, the conditional call is a special <code>COND</code> node that may or may not execute the specified graph named <code>if</code>. All of the nodes of the main graph are executed, but the <code>COND</code> operation may or may not execute the inner subgraph. There is absolutely no parallelization possible based on the set of dependencies, but it's clear that <code>OP5</code> can't run until both <code>OP1</code> and <code>COND(if)</code> are run.</p>
<p>Back to classic Turing machines, what is the opposite of an <code>if</code> statement in a Turing tape? It's not <code>else if</code> or <code>else</code> as those are just other forward jumps on different conditions. The opposite of an <code>if</code> is a <code>do-while</code> statement, because that is a jump <em>backwards</em>. </p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-loop.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ-based loop"></p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
do {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
  var d = op5(a);
} while (d);
op6(a);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent in a graph representation would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-loop.png" alt="Graph Example with do-while loop"></p>
<p>Here a <code>DOWHILE</code> opcode runs the loop sub-graph over and over until the expected condition is met. So with these two special opcodes <code>COND</code> and <code>DOWHILE</code> we can reproduce the behavior of <code>JNZ</code>'s forwards and backwards jumping and we can enter infinite loops with <code>DOWHILE</code>, meaning we should be Turing Complete.</p>
<p>So how do we make this barely <em>not</em> Turing complete? We make a list/array type a first class citizen in the VM itself and then we only add operations that know the bounds that they are to operate on based on that list or some other condition that cannot be <em>directly</em> mutated by the user's own code.</p>
<p>Now for an array of data we can have an <code>each</code> opcode that applies a given sub-graph of operations to every node in the array. The Alan runtime, or AVM, can tell based on the expected execution time of the graph and the number of nodes and the cost to send that data to multiple threads whether or not to do a fork-join or not. Probably no for 10 elements and probably yes for 10 billion, but where's the threshold and why? That's something better left for a computer to decide in realtime …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>

Republished by Stripe Press in 2018, it soon became a must-read inside Silicon Valley, particularly among those astonished at how they themselves had become the central story to the central challenges in the West. This spy from the Beltway made a victory lap in Silicon Valley, where I met him at a book launch dinner. Aside from the usual Cuban-exile plotting, we’ve been kibbitzing about tech and media ever since.</strong></p><p><strong>This Q&amp;A was conducted over email, and Gurri’s answers are unedited.</strong></p><div><p><strong>'<a href="https://amzn.to/2Fp9Av6">Revolt of the Public</a>' is an obvious play on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gasset/">Ortega y Gassett's</a> <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-smartest-book-about-our-digital-age-was-published-in-1929">'Revolt of the Masses' </a>(which I think you credit). In a sense, it's an updated version of Ortega's book, but this time the 'mass man' has smartphones and an even bigger entitlement chip on their shoulder. <p>That said, I find the eponymous reference here to be Lasch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lasch#The_Revolt_of_the_Elites:_And_the_Betrayal_of_Democracy">'The Revolt of the Elites'</a>. Your book seems a closing parenthetical bookend to that classic work. To very briefly summarize, Lasch predicted that the formerly aristocratic WASP elites, who considered the US their personal political project which they took on with a considerable sense of duty and noblesse oblige, would be replaced by a grasping and transactional neoliberal elite utterly indifferent to the plight of those outside the new economic order. In short, he predicted the Whole Foods-buying, Zoom-using class that we now take for granted, but who at the time were still an odd bird. </p><p>(I'm old enough to remember the mass-market, middle-class post-Eisenhower, pre-Summer-of-Love America, at least as transmitted by my parents who very agilely acclimated to it from the pre-revolutionary, bourgeois Cuba they fled.)</p><p>The relationship is causal: We wouldn't have had the Revolt of the Public in the 2010s without the Revolt of the Elites in the 80s. What do you make of the generational juxtaposition?</p></strong></p></div><p>Well, when my parents brought <em>me</em> to the United States from Cuba, Eisenhower was president.&nbsp; I remember the Summer of Love – hazily.&nbsp; That’s how old I am.&nbsp; So enough of that nonsense, young Antonio.</p><p>I began <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> in media res, at the point in which I and a circle of analysts in CIA became aware that the information landscape was being torn to shreds.&nbsp; I began with the digital tsunami.&nbsp; I hadn’t read the Lasch book at the time, though I have since.&nbsp; I agree with you that it’s a brilliant work of analysis and that it connects directly with my framework.</p><p>The great political conflict of our century, I believe, is that between a networked public and the elites who inhabit the great hierarchical institutions that organize modern life.&nbsp; <em>The Revolt of the Public</em> opens with this tectonic collision already rattling the world.&nbsp; The first edition of the book was published in 2014, and I desperately wanted to make readers aware that behind the rituals of our partisan politics a much more profound struggle was battering and changing the society we had inherited from the 20th century.&nbsp; I used words like “negation” and “nihilism” – it makes me smile to recall how much I agonized whether these terms were too sensational for an analyst to use.&nbsp; Since 2016 and the advent of Donald Trump, of course, everybody wants to talk about nihilism.&nbsp; (Trump’s election gave book sales a big boost, BTW – I sort of place myself in the same category as the <em>New York Times</em>, as a Trump profiteer.)</p><p>But the book left open a number of fundamental questions.&nbsp; For example, the public appears as a leading political actor on center stage already in an angry and rejectionist mood.&nbsp; The public is driven to the streets – and to vote for populists – by a need to repudiate the established order that sometimes tips into nihilism.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; The usual economic explanations explain nothing, in my opinion.&nbsp; Revolts have happened in poor countries like Somalia and affluent countries like France, Chile, and the US – and the public in revolt, when looked at closely, consists mostly of middle class and college-educated people.&nbsp; That’s true everywhere.</p><p>Similarly, the book shows the elites to be in a state of confusion bordering on panic.&nbsp; They are baffled by anything digital and utterly clueless about where all the nonentities shouting angrily outside their windows come from.&nbsp; But why?&nbsp; In the last century, two generations of elites tackled the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, and came ahead on every count.&nbsp; They built the great dams and nuclear plants that electrified the country, and threw in the interstate highway grid for good measure.&nbsp; What has changed?</p><p>That is where Lasch and <em>Revolt of the Elites</em> make a significant contribution to understanding our present moment.&nbsp; He describes the movement from Jefferson’s “aristocracy of talent” to a “meritocracy” that justifies itself by definition and by opposition.&nbsp; If you are an elite, you must deserve to be one.&nbsp; Why else would you be in your important perch in the hierarchy?&nbsp; After all, you went to the best schools, travelled widely, and speak a few words of French!&nbsp; And of course, every Brahmin class needs a thick wall to keep out the lower castes.&nbsp; Those are the people who went to community college, speak Southern, and on the rare occasion they travel end up (like Mr. Bean) saying “gracias” at the Louvre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is Lasch on this subject:&nbsp; “The new elites are in revolt against ‘Middle America,’ as they imagine it; a nation technologically backward, politically reactionary, repressive in it sexual morality, middlebrow in tastes, smug and complacent, dull and dowdy.”</p><h4><em>The public, which swims comfortably in the digital sea, knows far more than elites trapped in obsolete structures.&nbsp; The public knows when the elites fail to deliver their promised “solutions,” when they tell falsehoods or misspeak, when they are caught in sexual escapades, and when they indulge in astonishing levels of smugness and hypocrisy.&nbsp; The public is disenchanted in the elites and their institutions, much in the way science disenchanted the world of fairies and goblins.&nbsp; The natural reaction is cynicism.&nbsp; The elites aren’t seen as fallible humans doing their best, but as corrupt and arrogant jerks.</em></h4><p>In other words, the elites had abandoned the idea of serving the public before the arrival of the digital tsunami.  What that catastrophe did was to reverse the polarities of power:  it was the public that was now technologically adept, politically restless, and in revolt against the perplexed elites.  The vast gap remained, and the elites have no wish to cross it – to do so would mean breaking that wall that protects the pure soul of the Brahmin.</p><p>We have no way of knowing whether a more talented elite class could have avoided the current anger mobilizing the public or the hair-trigger impulse to revolt.&nbsp; There are no laboratories that run parallel versions of history.&nbsp; I will say this:&nbsp; the struggle today is structural, not personality-dependent.&nbsp; Even an FDR or a Reagan would have difficulty preserving institutions whose authority has collapsed because of a radical reversal in the information environment.</p><p><strong>You write:<p>"Uncertainty is an acid, corrosive to authority. Once the monopoly on information is lost, so too is our trust. Every presidential statement, every CIA assessment, every investigative report by a great newspaper, suddenly acquired an arbitrary aspect, and seemed grounded in moral predilection rather than intellectual rigor. When proof for and against approaches infinity, a cloud of suspicion about cherry-picking data will hang over every authoritative judgment."</p><p>Your assertion, developed eloquently and at length, is that elites are no longer able to mediate reality via mass media, therefore convulsing into feckless inertia as a clamorous public picks apart every institutional shortfall. </p><p>What I couldn't quite discern was whether you thought this was purely a narrative failing, or indeed a competency one? </p><p>In other words, the news has always been fake and the histories at least partly (if not wholly) contrived.&nbsp; Read a French history of Napoleon and compare it to an Anglo one. Or for that matter, read your typical (lefty) English-language take on Cuba, vs. a Spanish language one. But they were self-consistent narratives maintained within meaningful political and linguistic borders. As flawed as these narratives were and are--the map was very definitely not the territory--they were coherent worldviews that helped that society navigate reality. Now those guiding (but also blinding) narratives are gone. Social media has served as a sort of society-wide bodycam: the institutional abuse was always there, now we're simply seeing it.</p><p>Or is your entire argument that institutions are really mired in a period of secular incompetence and decline?</p></strong><em><br></em></p><p>The highest calling of true elites is to translate the flux of reality into a coherent story.&nbsp; To most Americans, who believe reality must be approached “scientifically,” this sounds like spin or propaganda – but it’s much more essential than that.&nbsp; Every society is organized around specific ideals and habits of behavior.&nbsp; The institutions of government, information, commerce, even science, are erected on the basis of those ideals and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_content"><div><div><p>Last Updated </p><!-- --><p>July 17, 2020</p></div><div><p>Reading Times:</p><p>Summary only: 1 minute</p></div></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>If you've popped your head into Satchel anytime in the past three weeks, you might've seen one of a few (okay fine, one of many) live chat widgets on the bottom-right of the site. If you had the suspicion that we were testing something out, you were right.  We've pretty much done a gigantic A/B test (in this case, more like an A/B/C/D/E/F/G test) to figure out what live chat software you should use if you're an early-stage startup.</p><p>Here's the punchline: use Chatwoot. We think it actually beats out a lot of the big-name, established chat tools out there (and by more than a small margin). It's open-source w/ a hosted option<span></span><span>Read: free or low-cost.</span>, has all of the core functionality you need, was best-liked by visitors when we tested on Satchel (tied with Intercom), and, importantly, passed all of the engineering litmus tests that we've developed over the past few weeks. More on these in a bit.</p><p>We were originally going to split our recommendation between Intercom and Chatwoot, but after talking to a lot of later-stage Intercom customers, we've heard enough stories of price-gouging that we think that there's a big red flag. The full story is a bit more nuanced, but we'll dive into it shortly</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/778fcd4101a8074c6a90332fc23cfc02f3964db7/7bec3/logos/chatwoot.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">Chatwoot</a></p><p>Robust, open-source, and preferred by visitors</p><p>Chatwoot was one of the best-liked live chat tools in the eyes of our visitors, and doesn't run into any engineering issues that are many other alternatives have. Plus, it's open source, with a generous hosted option.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://chatwoot.com/?utm_source=satchel">chatwoot.com</a></p></div></div><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="general-findings">General Findings</h2><h3 id="initial-methodology">Initial Methodology</h3><p>We're focused primarily on the core live chat use case — human-to-human communication. Some chat tools come as part of a larger "customer relationship platform," with things like email marketing capabilities, help desk software, a customer CRM, etc. While some early-stage startups take advantage of this functionality, we find that most of it usually goes unused. Of the 18 founders we surveyed, all but one said that the human-to-human communication was overwhelmingly the most important aspect of their live chat setup<span></span><span>The remaining founder saw the live chat messenger as another communication channel for marketing automation. Marketing automation is a closely related usecase, so we'll talk about that in a bit.</span>. We aren't going to outright dismiss this auxiliary functionality — we'll go more in-depth when we make our rounds discussing each specific product, as these features are product-specific — but much of early-stage startup usage of these live chat products is for, well, live<span></span><span>Or almost live, in the case of continuing a live chat conversation over email.</span> human-to-human communication. Therefore, we'll be focusing our evaluation on the aspects of a product related to human-to-human communication.</p><p>Affordability and ease of use are straightforward and easy to understand, with the latter encompassing both our high-level evaluation of ease of use as well as our assessment of quality-of-life features (e.g. canned responses). Closely related to ease of use is our appraisal of each product's core functionality, which encompass any features that are directly related to live chat. We categorize any functionality that could warrant a standalone article (e.g. marketing automation, help desk, customer CRM, etc.) as adjacent functionality</p><p>After testing for a few weeks, we formulated two new criteria: robustness and end-user preference. We realized that these criteria are substantially more important than we initially gave them credit for, and are the basis of our litmus tests.</p><h3 id="the-litmus-tests">The Litmus Tests</h3><p>Here's where it gets interesting — we did a meta survey of 50 visitors via live chat (doubly meta) to learn more about live chat and live chat products from an end-user perspective. Initially, what we heard didn't surprise us too much — if you've implemented a live chat widget but don't respond, then your users will get frustrated; if you cover up important content with an immovable floating chat button, same deal. These are pretty obvious.</p><p>But we quickly started to see the emergence of an interesting, less obvious trend: that visitors often over-index on the quality of a live chat widget. Specifically, we found that visitors had a worse impression of a live chat widget when it had worse design, and, importantly, that impression translated to the rest of the webpage. </p><p>In other words, using a poorly-designed live chat widget lowered people's impressions of the rest of our website. That said, this observation didn't go in the other direction — that a well-designed live chat tool didn't leave a better impression on visitors than without.</p><p>We initially thought this entire observation was an oddity, but it does make intuitive sense. People are naturally drawn to things that look out-of-place. If you have a well-designed site with well-designed live chat, then your visitors' impressions will be that it's business as usual. But if you have a well-designed site with a poorly-designed widget, then your visitors will start to anchor on that one poorly-designed element. This is compounded by the fact that a live chat widget will likely be the most prominent thing on your website that you won't have styling control over<span></span><span>Plus, whether you like it or not, some live chat providers try to make their widgets as eye-catching as possible.</span>, so it tends to draw lots of attention.</p><p>As we wrapped up testing, we came across another realization: the best products to use (for both us and visitors) were those that had the most attention to detail in the live chat widget. This should make intuitive sense — if a company doesn't address some easy-to-fix (but important) details when engineering the part of the product that people will see and interact with the most, then that's usually an indication that other things are broken behind the scenes. For example, there are plenty of ways for a widget to expand the chatbox when you click on a live chat button: CSS fades, CSS resizes, JS resizes, etc. If a product chooses one of the few approaches that lag and drop frames, especially when there are perfectly performant and usable alternatives, then that's usually a pretty good predictor that the overall quality of the product isn't top notch. The same goes for positioning issues (broken CSS <code>position</code>), formatting problems (inconsistent, out-of-whack <code>li</code> margins), etc.</p><h2 id="our-recommendation-chatwoot">Our Recommendation: Chatwoot</h2><p>We think that Chatwoot has produced a better live chat product than a number of companies that have had a lot more time and manpower. This wasn't a conclusion we expected to make going into our testing process.</p><p>First off, Chatwoot is built well and designed well. The two litmus tests we mentioned earlier? It passes both with flying colors. </p><p>Chatwoot has one of the most well-designed chat widgets both in our eyes and, more importantly, the eyes of our visitors. According to the visitors we talked to, Intercom and Chatwoot were the standouts by far, with Intercom barely edging out the #1 spot. Moreover, Chatwoot, along with Intercom, LiveChat.com, and Olark, was the only chat product that we tested that didn't have a noticeable engineering deficiency on its chat widget. Chatwoot's live chat widget expands from the chat button smoothly without stutters (unlike Freshchat), visitors didn't notice any styling issues (unlike Tawk.to), and the widget loaded in and updated as expected on every website we tested it on (unlike Drift and Crisp). As previously mentioned: while other product's front-end engineering deficiencies might be minor, we found that they're usually a pretty good canary in the coal mine.</p><p>For human-to-human live chat, Chatwoot more or less has all of the core functionality that you should need. It has support for tagging, custom canned responses and shortkeys, chat user details (e.g. browser, OS, etc. that are useful for debugging), email continuation (i.e. to allow users to continue conversations over email), a relatively simple analytics dashboard (not the most advanced one out there, but perfectly serviceable as long as you don't have a full-blown customer service division), and a solid implementation of expected API functionality (e.g. for propagating metadata programmatically to show up when you're chatting with a user, e.g. programmatically setting a user ID so you immediately know what account your user is using). </p><p>The main thing that it lacks is a library of native integrations and support for prequalification and advanced info gathering (through a chatbot or a custom form). Chatwoot has a Slack integration that can ping a Slack channel when new messages come in, but that's it in terms of native integrations. If you want an integration with another product, you'll have to roll it out yourself via their webhook. There's no one-click solution to, say, auto-populate a new account in your CRM when a new visitor starts chatting — if you have a critical integration, you'll have to fiddle around with some webhook connectors like Zapier/Integromat<span></span><span>This is likely a downside but not a dealbreaker if you're an early-stage startup.</span>. Secondly, it doesn't have much support for prequalification or information gathering tasks. Specifically: the widget has a well-designed and well-integrated optional email capture field, but apart from that, it doesn't have any capability to add custom form fields (e.g. for requiring someone's name and company size before they can chat). There's also no chatbot support, although this is ostensibly on their roadmap, so you can't do things like auto-route people to a pricing page if they're interested in pricing. That said, we think that this is a perfectly acceptable tradeoff for an early-stage startup. Chatbots and custom fields are typically used for prequalification at high volume to save time by customer service agents, but usually degrade the chat experience compared to a human on the other end. This shouldn't be something to worry about for an early-stage company.</p></div></div>

            <p><a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> has seen rapid adoption recently, but the
learning resources are still fairly scarce. This is an attempt to provide a next
step after the Bevy book.  The final product looks like this:</p>

<p>It’s about 300 lines of Rust, so buckle in; this is a lengthy walkthrough. If
you want to fast-forward to the finished code, the code lives
<a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/tree/tutorial">here</a>. For each
section there’s a diff at the top, which should make it easier to determine
where to place snippets of code, when it’s not clear.</p>

<p>We’ll start how the bevy book starts, with an app that does nothing. Run <code>cargo new bevy-snake</code>, then put the following in your <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> bevy::prelude::<span>*</span>;

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>We’ll need to add bevy as a dependency in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, and because I have
the ability to predict the future of this tutorial, let’s go ahead and add
<code>rand</code> in there too so we have it when the time comes.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>//</span> ...

[<span>dependencies</span>]
<span>bevy</span> = <span>"0.3.0"</span>
<span>rand</span> = <span>"0.7.3"</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-a-window">Creating a window</h2>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>We’re going to be creating a 2D game, which requires a lot of different systems;
one to create a window, one to do a render loop, one to handle input, one to
handle sprites, etc. Luckily Bevy’s default plugins give us all of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    App::build().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).run();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Bevy’s default plugins don’t include a camera though, so let’s insert a 2d
camera, which we’ll set up by creating our first system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
}
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.2.1/bevy_ecs/struct.Commands.html"><code>Commands</code></a> is
used to queue up commands to mutate the world and resources. In this case, we’re
spawning a new entity, with 2D camera components. Prepare for some bevy magic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">App::build()
    .add_startup_system(setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    .run();
</code></pre></div><p>All we have to do is call <code>.system()</code> on our function, and Bevy will
auto-magically call it at startup with the <code>commands</code> param. Run the app again,
and you should get an empty window like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_pics/empty_window.png"></p><h2 id="the-beginnings-of-a-snake">The beginnings of a snake</h2>

    <div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/marcusbuffett/bevy_snake/commit/baaefcc">See the diff</a> for this section
    </p></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s try to get a snake head in there. We’ll define a couple structs:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>SnakeHead</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Materials</span> {
    head_material: <span>Handle</span><span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p><code>SnakeHead</code> is just an empty struct that we’ll use as a component, it’s sort of
like a tag, we’ll put on an entity, and then we can find that entity later by
querying for entities with the <code>SnakeHead</code> component. Empty structs like these
are a common pattern in Bevy, components often don’t need any state of their
own. <code>Materials</code> is going to be a resource, which stores the material that
we’ll use for the snake head for now, and eventually for the snake segments and
the food.</p>
<p>That <code>head_material</code> handle should be created when the game gets set up, so let’s
do that next, by modifying our <code>setup</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, <span>mut</span> materials: <span>ResMut</span><span>&lt;</span>Assets<span>&lt;</span>ColorMaterial<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) {
    commands.spawn(Camera2dComponents::default());
    commands.insert_resource(Materials {
        head_material: <span>materials</span>.add(Color::rgb(<span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>, <span>0.7</span>).into()),
    });
}
</code></pre></div><div>
    <p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/warning_icon.svg">
    </p>
    
    <p>Bevy requires a specific ordering to the params when registering
systems. Commands → Resources → Components/Queries. If you get a mysterious
compile-time error after messing with a system, check your order. </p>
</div>
<p><code>materials.add</code> will return a <code>Handle&lt;ColorMaterial&gt;</code>. We create a
<code>Materials</code> struct using this new handle. Later, when we try to access a
resource with the type of <code>Materials</code>, Bevy will find this struct we’ve
created. We’ll now create our snake head entity in a new system, and you can see
what using that resource looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>game_setup</span>(<span>mut</span> commands: <span>Commands</span>, materials: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Materials<span>&gt;</span>) {
    commands
        .spawn(SpriteComponents {
            material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
            sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .with(SnakeHead);
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here we’ve got a new system, which will look for a resource of type
<code>Materials</code>. It will then spawn a new entity, with <code>SpriteComponents</code> and
<code>SnakeHead</code> as components. To create the <code>SpriteComponents</code>, we pass in the
handle to the color material we created earlier, and give the sprite a size
of (10,10). Let’s just add that system into our app builder:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system(setup.system())
.add_startup_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>The reason we need a new stage instead of just calling <code>add_startup_system</code>
again, is that we need to use the material that gets inserted in the <code>setup</code>
function. After running this, you should see a snake head in the middle of the
screen:</p>

<p>Snake isn’t much of a game without movement, so let’s get that head moving.
We’ll worry about input later, for now our goal is just to get the head to
move. So let’s create a system that will move all snake heads up:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(<span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The main new concept here is that <code>Query</code> type. We can use it to iterate through
all entities that have both the <code>SnakeHead</code> component and the <code>Transform</code>
component. We don’t have to worry about actually creating that query, bevy will
take care of creating it and calling our function with it, part of the ECS
magic. So let’s add that system in and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">.add_startup_system_to_stage(<span>"game_setup"</span>, game_setup.system())
.add_system(snake_movement.system()) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
</code></pre></div><p>Here’s what we get, a snake head moving off-screen:</p>

    <source src="https://mbuffett.com/bevy_snake/new_gifs/moving_up.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>You may be wondering about that Transform component. When we spawned the
<code>SnakeHead</code>, we didn’t give it a <code>Transform</code>, so how come we’re able to find an
entity that has a <code>SnakeHead</code> and a <code>Transform</code> component? What’s going on there
is that <code>SpriteComponents</code> is a
<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.1.2/bevy/prelude/trait.Bundle.html"><code>Bundle</code></a> of
components. For <code>SpriteComponents</code>, that means we get a <code>Transform</code> component,
among a bunch of others (<code>Sprite</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, <code>Draw</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, <code>Scale</code>, etc).</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s modify our snake movement system to actually allow us to direct the snake:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>snake_movement</span>(
    keyboard_input: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Input<span>&lt;</span>KeyCode<span>&gt;&gt;</span>,
    <span>mut</span> head_positions: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>SnakeHead, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>,
) {
    <span>for</span> (_head, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> head_positions.iter_mut() {
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Left) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Right) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.x_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Down) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>-=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> keyboard_input.pressed(KeyCode::Up) {
            <span>*</span>transform.translation.y_mut() <span>+=</span> <span>2.</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can control the snake, albeit in very un-snake-like fashion:</p>

    </p></div>
</div>
<p>So far we’ve been using window coordinates, and the way that works is that (0,0)
is the middle, and the units are pixels. Snake games generally use grids, so if
we made our snake game 10x10, our window would be <em>really</em> small. Let’s make our
lives a bit easier by using our own positioning and sizing. Then we can use
systems that deal with transforming these to window coordinates.</p>
<p>We’ll make our grid 10x10. We’ll define those as constants up at the top of the
file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> ARENA_WIDTH: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
<span>const</span> ARENA_HEIGHT: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Here are our new structs for positioning/sizing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[derive(Default, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Position</span> {
    x: <span>i32</span>,
    y: <span>i32</span>,
}

<span>struct</span> <span>Size</span> {
    width: <span>f32</span>,
    height: <span>f32</span>,
}
<span>impl</span> Size {
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>square</span>(x: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        Self {
            width: <span>x</span>,
            height: <span>x</span>,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Fairly straightforward, with a helper method to get a <code>Size</code> with equal width
and height. Position derives some traits that will be useful later, so we don’t
have to keep going back to it. <code>Size</code> could really just have one float, since
all objects will end up having equal width and height, but it feels wrong so I’m
giving it a width and a height. Let’s add those components to the snake head we
spawn:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust">commands
    .spawn(SpriteComponents {
        material: <span>materials</span>.head_material.clone(),
        sprite: <span>Sprite</span>::new(Vec2::new(<span>10.0</span>, <span>10.0</span>)),
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .with(SnakeHead)
    .with(Position { x: <span>3</span>, y: <span>3</span> }) <span>// &lt;--
</span><span></span>    .with(Size::square(<span>0.8</span>)); <span>// &lt;--
</span></code></pre></div><p>These components aren’t doing anything currently, let’s start with transforming
our sizes into sprite sizes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>size_scaling</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Size, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Sprite)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>for</span> (size, <span>mut</span> sprite) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
        sprite.size <span>=</span> Vec2::new(
            size.width <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
            size.height <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>/</span> ARENA_HEIGHT <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> window.height() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>,
        );
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The sizing logic goes like so: if something has a width of 1 in a grid of 40,
and the window is 400px across, then it should have a width of 10. Next we can
do the positioning system:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>position_translation</span>(windows: <span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span>Windows<span>&gt;</span>, <span>mut</span> q: <span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>Position, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> Transform)<span>&gt;</span>) {
    <span>fn</span> <span>convert</span>(p: <span>f32</span>, bound_window: <span>f32</span>, bound_game: <span>f32</span>) -&gt; <span>f32</span> {
        p <span>/</span> bound_game <span>*</span> bound_window <span>-</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>) <span>+</span> (bound_window <span>/</span> bound_game <span>/</span> <span>2.</span>)
    }
    <span>let</span> window <span>=</span> windows.get_primary().unwrap();
    <span>for</span> (pos, <span>mut</span> transform) <span>in</span> q.iter_mut() {
        transform.translation <span>=</span> Vec3::new(
            convert(pos.x <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, window.width() <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>, ARENA_WIDTH <span>as</span> <span>f32</span>),

            <div>
                <p>At the start of this hectic year I have joined <a href="https://m3o.com/">Micro</a>, an open source microservices platform. The company was born out of a <a href="https://github.com/asim/nitro">Go framework</a>. We took the concepts of the framework - interfaces for service discovery, configuration and other pieces which can run on any implementation (from mdns locally to kubernetes) and provide a live platform version of it. It’s kind of like Netlify, but for the backend.</p>

<p>Once we were happy with the local development flow for the micro server and CLI, we decided to start selling the product as a platform. Building a website seemed like an obvious step to do. It’s 2020 right?</p>

<p>So we got to work. Metrics with nice charts. Tracing. Calling services. Listing endpoints.
It was all shaping up nicely. But slowly and surely we started missing features we got accustomed to on the frontend in the CLI. Being very heavy command line users, whenever we got something available in the CLI, we reached there first.</p>

<p>And then we realised. Who are we building this frontend exactly and why? We prefer the command line. And none of our many thousands of users were asking for a web UI. At most it was considered a “cool” thing to have.</p>

<p>The past three decades have been all about the world wide web (www) and in that we’ve gone through the multiple iterations
of building “web first” experiences which I’d argue really peaked in the Web 2.0 era in the mid 00s with the likes of
Facebook and others. At some point we entered the “Mobile first” era and yet for developers, Web still became a horrible
platform we were stuck with for any platform or tools, AWS is a great example of how to get it really wrong.
If new products and platforms are going Mobile first, maybe we as developers need to go CLI first. So here it is. M3O
is a CLI first experience. No context switches, no ugly dashboards, just a simple straight forward command line utility
that gets out of your way when you need it to.
Our hope at Micro is more learn from this experience and do away with Web UIs entirely. Challenge every assumption you know
about Web for backend development and think, do I really need that, or is it better served as a single CLI experience.</p>

<p>So we doubled down. We entirely sidelined the web UI and decided payment will be the only thing on the website, should supplying card details in the terminal feel sketchy.</p>

<p>What we found after this surprised us. By limiting our choices we unleashed a storm of ideas on how to improve the single medium we can express our thoughts in.</p>

<p>We started to make service call feel just like any command invocation.</p>

<p>What was previously</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro call servicename endpoint <span>'{"field":"value","otherfield":{"subfield":"value2"}}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro servicename endpoint <span>--field</span><span>=</span>value <span>--otherfield_subfield</span><span>=</span>value2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the surface it might not seem much, but when you are living and breathing these commands it provides a great satisfaction to remove even little frictions.</p>

<p>New services and their endpoints feel just like builtin Micro commands, which is why our invites simply became</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro invite user <span>--email</span><span>=</span>someone@domain.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Shipping features to end users became as deploying a new service, and users can easily programatically call their endpoints from the terminal.</p>

<p>Bash shines at quick and information dense throwaway scripts, so our <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/test">end to end test framework</a> is built for tests to be written using Micro CLI commands.</p>

<p>We dream of a future where programming is as close to natural languages as possible.
At the moment, the ubiquity of bash provides a great layer for us to quickly interact with microservices. It truly feels like the platform is alive as nouns and verbs are being created by service writers to be composed into sentences.</p>

<p>Why don’t you <a href="https://m3o.com/">give it a go</a>? We have a free tier ;).</p>

<p> About twenty years ago Jobs and Wozniak, the founders of Apple, came
up with the very strange idea of selling information processing machines
for use in the home. The business took off, and its founders made a lot of
money and received the credit they deserved for being daring visionaries.
But around the same time, Bill Gates and Paul Allen came up with an idea
even stranger and more fantastical: selling computer operating systems.
This was much weirder than the idea of Jobs and Wozniak. A computer at
least had some sort of physical reality to it. It came in a box, you could
open it up and plug it in and watch lights blink. An operating system had
no tangible incarnation at all. It arrived on a disk, of course, but the
disk was, in effect, nothing more than the box that the OS came in. The
product itself was a very long string of ones and zeroes that, when
properly installed and coddled, gave you the ability to manipulate other
very long strings of ones and zeroes. Even those few who actually
understood what a computer operating system was were apt to think of it as
a fantastically arcane engineering prodigy, like a breeder reactor or a
U-2 spy plane, and not something that could ever be (in the parlance of
high-tech) "productized." 

</p><p> Yet now the company that Gates and Allen founded is selling operating
systems like Gillette sells razor blades. New releases of operating
systems are launched as if they were Hollywood blockbusters, with
celebrity endorsements, talk show appearances, and world tours. The market
for them is vast enough that people worry about whether it has been
monopolized by one company. Even the least technically-minded people in
our society now have at least a hazy idea of what operating systems do;
what is more, they have strong opinions about their relative merits. It is
commonly understood, even by technically unsophisticated computer users,
that if you have a piece of software that works on your Macintosh, and you
move it over onto a Windows machine, it will not run. That this would, in
fact, be a laughable and idiotic mistake, like nailing horseshoes to the
tires of a Buick. 

</p><p> A person who went into a coma before Microsoft was founded, and woke
up now, could pick up this morning's New York Times and understand
everything in it--almost: 

</p><ul>
<li>Item: the richest man in the world made his fortune
     from-what? Railways? Shipping? Oil? No, operating systems.
</li><li>Item: the Department of Justice is tackling Microsoft's
     supposed OS monopoly with legal tools that were invented to
     restrain the power of Nineteenth-Century robber barons.
</li><li>Item: a woman friend of mine recently told me that she'd
     broken off a (hitherto) stimulating exchange of e-mail with
     a young man. At first he had seemed like such an intelligent
     and interesting guy, she said, but then "he started going
     all PC-versus-Mac on me."
</li></ul>

<p> What the hell is going on here? And does the operating system business
have a future, or only a past? Here is my view, which is entirely
subjective; but since I have spent a fair amount of time not only using,
but programming, Macintoshes, Windows machines, Linux boxes and the BeOS,
perhaps it is not so ill-informed as to be completely worthless. This is a
subjective essay, more review than research paper, and so it might seem
unfair or biased compared to the technical reviews you can find in PC
magazines.  But ever since the Mac came out, our operating systems have
been based on metaphors, and anything with metaphors in it is fair game as
far as I'm concerned. 


</p><p>MGBs, TANKS, AND BATMOBILES

</p><p> Around the time that Jobs, Wozniak, Gates, and Allen were dreaming up
these unlikely schemes, I was a teenager living in Ames, Iowa. One of my
friends' dads had an old MGB sports car rusting away in his garage.
Sometimes he would actually manage to get it running and then he would
take us for a spin around the block, with a memorable look of wild
youthful exhiliration on his face; to his worried passengers, he was a
madman, stalling and backfiring around Ames, Iowa and eating the dust of
rusty Gremlins and Pintos, but in his own mind he was Dustin Hoffman
tooling across the Bay Bridge with the wind in his hair. 

</p><p> In retrospect, this was telling me two things about people's
relationship to technology. One was that romance and image go a long way
towards shaping their opinions. If you doubt it (and if you have a lot of
spare time on your hands) just ask anyone who owns a Macintosh and who, on
those grounds, imagines him- or herself to be a member of an oppressed
minority group. 

</p><p> The other, somewhat subtler point, was that interface is very
important. Sure, the MGB was a lousy car in almost every way that counted:
balky, unreliable, underpowered. But it was fun to drive. It was
responsive. Every pebble on the road was felt in the bones, every nuance
in the pavement transmitted instantly to the driver's hands. He could
listen to the engine and tell what was wrong with it. The steering
responded immediately to commands from his hands. To us passengers it was
a pointless exercise in going nowhere--about as interesting as peering
over someone's shoulder while he punches numbers into a spreadsheet. But
to the driver it was an experience. For a short time he was extending his
body and his senses into a larger realm, and doing things that he couldn't
do unassisted. 

</p><p> The analogy between cars and operating systems is not half bad, and so
let me run with it for a moment, as a way of giving an executive summary
of our situation today. 

</p><p> Imagine a crossroads where four competing auto dealerships are
situated. One of them (Microsoft) is much, much bigger than the others. It
started out years ago selling three-speed bicycles (MS-DOS); these were
not perfect, but they worked, and when they broke you could easily fix
them. 

</p><p> There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one
day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled
cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was
something of a mystery. 

</p><p> The big dealership responded by rushing a moped upgrade kit (the
original Windows) onto the market. This was a Rube Goldberg contraption
that, when bolted onto a three-speed bicycle, enabled it to keep up, just
barely, with Apple-cars. The users had to wear goggles and were always
picking bugs out of their teeth while Apple owners sped along in
hermetically sealed comfort, sneering out the windows. But the
Micro-mopeds were cheap, and easy to fix compared with the Apple-cars, and
their market share waxed. 

</p><p> Eventually the big dealership came out with a full-fledged car: a
colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic appeal of a
Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an
enormous success. A little later, they also came out with a hulking
off-road vehicle intended for industrial users (Windows NT) which was no
more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a little more reliable. 

</p><p> Since then there has been a lot of noise and shouting, but little has
changed. The smaller dealership continues to sell sleek Euro-styled sedans
and to spend a lot of money on advertising campaigns. They have had GOING
OUT OF BUSINESS! signs taped up in their windows for so long that they
have gotten all yellow and curly. The big one keeps making bigger and
bigger station wagons and ORVs. 

</p><p> On the other side of the road are two competitors that have come along
more recently. 

</p><p> One of them (Be, Inc.) is selling fully operational Batmobiles (the
BeOS). They are more beautiful and stylish even than the Euro-sedans,
better designed, more technologically advanced, and at least as reliable
as anything else on the market--and yet cheaper than the others. 

</p><p> With one exception, that is: Linux, which is right next door, and
which is not a business at all. It's a bunch of RVs, yurts, tepees, and
geodesic domes set up in a field and organized by consensus. The people
who live there are making tanks. These are not old-fashioned, cast-iron
Soviet tanks; these are more like the M1 tanks of the U.S. Army, made of
space-age materials and jammed with sophisticated technology from one end
to the other.  But they are better than Army tanks. They've been modified
in such a way that they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable
enough to use on ordinary streets, and use no more fuel than a subcompact
car. These tanks are being cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace,
and a vast number of them are lined up along the edge of the road with
keys in the ignition. Anyone who wants can simply climb into one and drive
it away for free. 

</p><p> Customers come to this crossroads in throngs, day and night.  Ninety
percent of them go straight to the biggest dealership and buy station
wagons or off-road vehicles. They do not even look at the other
dealerships. 

</p><p> Of the remaining ten percent, most go and buy a sleek Euro-sedan,
pausing only to turn up their noses at the philistines going to buy the
station wagons and ORVs. If they even notice the people on the opposite
side of the road, selling the cheaper, technically superior vehicles,
these customers deride them cranks and half-wits. 

</p><p> The Batmobile outlet sells a few vehicles to the occasional car nut
who wants a second vehicle to go with his station wagon, but seems to
accept, at least for now, that it's a fringe player. 

</p><p> The group giving away the free tanks only stays alive because it is
staffed by volunteers, who are lined up at the edge of the street with
bullhorns, trying to draw customers' attention to this incredible
situation. A typical conversation goes something like this: 

</p><p> Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks!
It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety miles
an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!" 

</p><p> Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is
true...but...er...I don't know how to …</p></div></div>

<h2>In the beginning, a love affair</h2>
<p>For the last 10 years or so, I have been a die-hard Vim user. I was introduced to Vim on my first programming job. It was almost an instant connection for me. I fell in love with the minimalism of only needing a terminal to do work; and the power of stringing together commands, like words, to edit programs and text.</p>
<p>The love affair I have with Vim stuck with me throughout my career and remains strong to this very day. When I was a junior-level release engineer, working on small scripts, Vim was amazing. Later, working as a Ruby on Rails Engineer, Vim was still an amazing editor. Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and countless other agencies, companies, and individuals contributed to the community (and cult) of Vim. That community pushed my knowledge, comfort, and understanding further and further.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was running tmux and Vim together in the terminal. With sufficient plugins and dotfiles, I was CRUISING through codebases. I could write tests, run them, refactor code, and run commands with absolute ease.</p>

<h2>Old feelings fade</h2>
<p>Lately, though, I have been feeling a little underwhelmed by Vim. Even with my sophisticated dotfiles, knowledge, and Plugin setup; something felt off. I started a new job working on a large typescript React project. Vim couldn’t handle opening a TSX file larger than 50 lines without crashing.</p>
<p>Within the last few years, I tried my hand at programming mobile applications. Flutter and Dart — although supported by an LSP — was not running very well on my Vim setup. After giving Android Studio a shot with Flutter, it felt like a whole new world.</p>

<center><i>Android Studio was a game changer</i></center>
<hr>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>. I actually understood the Flutter framework much better because Android Studio made deep framework code easy to debug, inspect, and explore. Not to mention, the Vim integration was <strong>fantastic</strong>. This was the best of both worlds. I had amazing editing, minimal configuration, and Vim keybindings!</p>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation. With and IDE like Android Studio, all of this came pre-built without any configuration.</p>
<p>Android Studio was something of a revelation for me. I began thinking to myself, “If this is so great for Flutter, wouldn’t this be great for my other projects?“.</p>
<h2>Vim to VSCode to Webstorm to IntelliJ</h2>
<p>I am now working almost exclusively on IntelliJ IDEA. It is the JetBrains defacto editor that includes plugins for almost anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>The list literally goes on forever</li>
</ul>
<p>Every project I work on — like this Gatsby blog in React, my corporate Typescript React job, or my Ruby on Rails side projects — All work within this one editor.</p>
<p>I had a brief stint with VSCode but, to me, it appeared to have the same flaws I disliked with Vim at the time. It was slow with large files, and it felt sluggish with complicated programs and complicated programming languages (like typescript and tsserver).</p>
<p>I also had a long affair with WebStorm, which was mostly great. I did; however, find it odd to be using an editor <strong>ONLY</strong> made for a few programs. If I wanted to run a Ruby on Rails app in Webstorm, I was SOL. I thought it was a little silly to run RubyMine, Webstorm, and Pycharm on one machine. If I wrote code in all three languages, shouldn’t one editor be able to handle it?</p>
<p>Eventually I wound up running IntelliJ with plugins that handle any programming need I may have. And for now, I am very happy. There are, of course, many cons with IntelliJ. But I truly believe the Pros outweigh the Cons.</p>
<h2>Vim and IntelliJ, a Pros and Cons list:</h2>
<p>I still think Vim is a great editor and I love to break it out every once in a while. But I believe the pros of IntelliJ outweigh the cons of Vim at this point in my career. Here is an overview of my thought process.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of Vim</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When picking up a new language or framework in Vim, I would spend hours configuring plugins, dealing with linting, and looking up documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>Pros:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimalist.</strong> All you need is the terminal, and that is it. You don’t need to open multiple windows, Tmux and Vim together were <strong>awesome</strong> for this.</li>
<li><strong>Gets you into the Flow:</strong> . Vim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">gets me into “The Flow”</a> better than anything. I just need to move my fingers a bit, and I’m in/out of windows, buffers, splits, etc… I specifically remember smiling when I was coding with Vim, because it just felt so fun sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible:</strong> It’s been around forever, Thoughtbot, Hashrocket, and many community members contributed greatly to it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Cons:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very steep learning curve:</strong> Vim takes a long time to learn, and you’ll never stop learning it. This is not a problem with more experienced users like myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Plugins:</strong> Quick, tell me the best plugin for auto-completion in Vim. ALE/Omnicomplete? YouCompleteMe? VimCompletesMe? DeoPlete? There is an insane number of plugins for any task you may have. And not all plugins play together. This has become slightly better with the emergence of LSPs; however, I constantly find myself playing with plugins to make things work better, only to dislike the setup and go for another mix of plugins later. Having dot files are nice, but when you switch computers/systems, you have to install pip3/python for some packages, node/npm/yarn for others, and for some, you’ll have to cd into the dir where its installed and run a makefile! (looking at you, YouCompleteMe)</li>
<li><strong>Doesn’t always play nice with everything else:</strong> I have had countless configurations with Vim. Vim standalone, NeoVim, Vim with Tmux, and MacVim/GUIVim. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but there is always one thing in common, it doesn’t play very well with every computer system. Try to set up copy+paste on Vim on a Mac, done? Ok great! Now do it for Linux. There are so many workarounds and hacks to get everything to play well together. When you get it set up, its nice, but sometimes its rough. I find myself reading old blog posts to remember how I set up yank + paste on my system-wide clipboard over and over.</li>
<li><strong>Isn’t very fun with complex codebases in complicated languages (like typescript):</strong> I remember starting a new job that used typescript, and there were a lot of engineers working on some really cool problems. After getting Vim/ ENV vars/ etc… all set up, I go to start woking in Vim and <strong>BAM</strong>, any file over 20 lines freezes and its incredibly slow to work with. Sure enough, my javascript parser/highlighting plugin (see my point above about plugins) was not efficient, and it was bogging down everything. So I had to settle for a lesser parser that performed better. A similar thing happens with prettier, eslint, and tsserver. If you need your code to be auto-fixed with these technologies, its blocks read/write. Even when your IO is blocked for only a short amount of time, it makes for a trudging, slow-as-molasses feeling when writing code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pros and Cons of IntelliJ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden, I had everything at my fingertips. Auto completion, Auto formatting, snippets, and documentation lookup was all set <strong>By Default</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong><em>PROS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything is pre-configured:</strong> You don’t have to worry about setting up tags, or YouCompleteMe, or NERDTree. I can’t tell you how many times I open a new project, perhaps in a different language, and everything works great out of the box. It’s a total sigh of relief.</li>
<li><strong>File watchers are powerful:</strong> There is a thing in IntelliJ called file watchers. You can set arbitrary tasks to run after you edit/save/type in a file. This can be super powerful when you have more advanced tasks you need to run in your codebase like: sorting imports, running specific eslint rules, or running rubocop after saving a file.</li>
<li><strong>Everything plays nicely with your OS:</strong>  I can’t tell you how many times I set up Vim and tmux on a new OS, like linux. I’ll run all my dot files, configure anything crazy I missed. Compile the plugins that need compilation. Fix any small issues that happen between Vim/tmux/linux (or Mac, whatever). Then I’m programming, and I have to copy+paste something, and BAM, I lose 4 hours configuring copy and paste correctly between Vim/tmux/</li>
<li><strong>Complicated codebases and languages are handled easily:</strong> After using IntelliJ (or Webstorm), all my problems with my large Typescript codebase went away. Everything gets indexed, parsed, highlighted, and rendered correctly. There are very few hangups when working with complicated codebases, and the exceptions are usually much easier to deal with than with Vim.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>CONS:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complicated Interface:</strong> The interface to IntelliJ is somewhat, complicated. There are a lot of tools, dropdown menus, and configurations. This is definitely a daunting thing at first, but once you get used to it, its not a big problem at all.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage:</strong> IntelliJ does eat up a bit of RAM on my machines. I believe this memory usage is worth it though. You’re paying an upfront price to index, tag, and cache programs, so your editing experience is smooth as butter. VSCode and Vim (with plugins) only do this lazily; therefore, your programming experience with complicated projects becomes very awkward and slow over time.</li>
<li><strong>Difficult configuration for some tasks:</strong> Again, this is something you get used to with time. Some configuration options with IntelliJ are less than ideal. For example, when setting up auto-formatting for eslint, you have to go through a couple hoops to set up a file watcher in IntelliJ. Once you understand this concept though, its fairly straightforward and easy to use with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I have decided that the pros for IntelliJ greatly outweigh the cons. I have …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/cover.webp" alt="Post cover image"><h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2><p>In October, we welcomed 26 new contributors with 70 pull requests (PRs) merged. It was an exhausting but also a fascinating experience.</p><h2 id="hacktoberfest-is-ok">Hacktoberfest Is Ok</h2><p>Don't be afraid of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. It is an excellent event for both contributors and maintainers.</p><p>There are <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">haters</a> that will tell you something different. My advice, follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean">truncated mean</a> measure and always discard extreme opinions, especially if they call for boycotting:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward</p></blockquote><p>Cancel culture at its best. The fact that someone is good at programming or works at Google or Facebook doesn't make them experts in everything. Remember that celebrities are not good candidates for a role model.</p><p>There are no perfect events; there are no best solutions. There is always a place for improvement, but it should be followed by open, civilized discussion.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that I hope the "harm to the open source made by DigitalOcean" is not as significant as the harm that such hate does to open source by discouraging new open-source contributors. However, this is just speculation. How can I consider any of these things harmful if I did not conduct scientific research? I can only confirm that Hacktoberfest did not harm <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a>. On the contrary, it was pretty neat.</p><h2 id="spam">Spam</h2><p>During the entire event, we had only two spam PRs. I can imagine that a much more popular and known project might have had more. Nevertheless, adding the <strong>invalid</strong> label and closing a PR is a super simple operation, three clicks.</p><p>The definition of spam heavily depends on maintainers. For example, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/19953">this</a> is not invalid to me, because I don't think of grammar as "subjective nits".</p><h2 id="why-we-participated-in-hacktoberfest">Why We Participated in Hacktoberfest</h2><p>Our intentions were pretty clear from the very beginning. As I wrote in the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">previous post</a>, we wanted to:</p><ul><li>Promote <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/">AsyncAPI Initiative</a> as a place where we work not only on the AsyncAPI specification, but also lots of tools</li><li>Help members of the broader open-source community make their first contributions in a friendly environment</li></ul><p>My impression is that sometimes the open-source is perceived as a kind of elite gathering. <strong>This is quite often blocking people from joining because they feel they cannot help but rather waste others' time.</strong> I was there in the past, I thought the same. It's just another variation of the damn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. You can always help, no matter what your experience is.</p><p>Start small. Don't start with tasks that can be overwhelming. Don't throw yourself into the deep end. </p><p>We wanted to help others make first baby steps in a secure and inclusive environment, with lots of patience and support.</p><h2 id="what-it-takes-to-have-70-prs-merged">What It Takes To Have 70 PRs Merged</h2><p>It is not enough to label 70 issues with the <strong>hacktoberfest</strong><undefined> label, sorry <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth">😃</span></undefined></p><p>First of all, you need to be passionate about open source and dedicated to what you do. It can't just be a task that somebody assigned to you. It would help if you were prepared to treat Hacktoberfest participants as a priority. I would compare it to the onboarding process of new hires. </p><p>Of course, not all participants join to stay longer, usually they just follow the  "one pull request, and I'm out of here" approach.</p><p>It doesn't matter. </p><p>Please don't make assumptions; assumptions are evil. Be opened, treat every contribution equally, and remember that the onboarding process is a crucial element. If you fail with the onboarding process, you fail big time at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="what-we-prepared">What We Prepared</h3><p>We prepared the following materials for potential participants:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2020">Blog post</a> about our participation</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigFSE_6G88x0t12HFLU4A4b">Onboarding videos</a> that explain how to start</li><li>78 issues from more than 30 repositories and put them all in one <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/">list</a> with additional information about the difficulty level or the technical area,</li></ul><p>It took me around eight workdays to do it all. The most time-consuming part was to go through all the issues, pick candidates, create new ones, and group them all in a Google Sheet.</p><h3 id="what-we-did-during-the-event">What We Did During The Event</h3><p><undefined>70 pull requests mean —at least— 70 reviews <span role="img" aria-label="smiling face with open mouth &amp; cold sweat">😅</span></undefined></p><p>If you know your project well, it is not very time-consuming, and anyway, it is the work you have to do as a maintainer. I do not count this time as an extra Hacktoberfest effort. Of course, it can be overwhelming if this is not a standard amount of PRs that you get every month.</p><p>We also hosted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi1gRlP7pigZP2da6zbDT2YU7glQOTPH">office hours</a> for participants. This was fun, and we wanted to start doing live streams about AsyncAPI anyway.</p><p>Last but not least, once a week, I advertised our project on the official Hacktoberfest Discord server.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/vscode-extension/pull/8#issuecomment-719759737"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-sharkham.webp"></a></p><p>It looks like we do not need to do more for the next year.</p><h2 id="was-it-worth-it">Was It Worth It</h2><p>Hell yeah, and I'm already looking forward to Hacktoberfest 2021.</p><p>It was great to see so many different people interacting with the project and seeing we reached our goal.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/html-template/pull/98#issuecomment-709014754"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-juergenbr.webp"></a></p><p>We got some new features, CI/CD cleanup in all repositories, and solved many trivial SonarCloud-reported issues that we would never found time to solve.</p><h2 id="what-made-it-such-a-success">What Made It Such a Success</h2><p>Our success was a typical return on investment.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/playground/pull/38#issuecomment-710014222"><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/feedback-Orodan.webp"></a></p><p>We asked all contributors to provide feedback on how they learned about us and what was the most helpful resource. 20 out of 26 responded to our request.</p><figure><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/how-they-learned.webp"><p>Figure 1: Ways in which the contributors learned about AsyncAPI participating in Hacktoberfest</p></figure><p>I think it is pretty clear that introducing the official Discord channel was a great idea. I personally do not like Discord because of the lack of support for threads, but better this than nothing.</p><figure><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest-summary-2020/what-they-used.webp"><p>Figure 2: Resources helpful for contributors</p></figure><p>Such a simple thing as a Google Sheet with a list of issues grouped by different factors was, in the end, our best resource for contributors. I encourage you to create such a sheet for your contributors next year.</p><h2 id="open-request-to-hacktoberfest-organizers">Open Request to Hacktoberfest Organizers</h2><p>There is one thing that calls for an improvement for next year. Just one? Yeah, opt-in solution for projects that want to participate in Hacktoberfest was addressed during this event, and I assume it stays on.</p><p>The number of projects that people can work on is overwhelming, and finding the right issue seems very difficult. Please have a look at the feedback we got from our contributors. It is enough to develop an official application where potential contributors can adequately filter out issues by technology and difficulty. In the end, it doesn't make sense for all maintainers to work on their own Google Sheets and post it on Discord. A better way would be to introduce an app for all.</p><h2 id="hall-of-fame">Hall Of Fame</h2><p>Below you can find a list of all contributors that joined AsyncAPI during Hacktoberfest and contributed their time to the project. The list is sorted alphabetically, including the number of PRs created by this contributor.</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@goian?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ian Schneider</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/success-event?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<p>Over 4 years ago I wrote a short blog post on images in the frequency domain: <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2016/07/28/fourier-transform-and-inverse-of-images/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2016/07/28/fourier-transform-and-inverse-of-images/</a></p>



<p>It’s time to revisit the topic a bit and add some more things.</p>



<p>If you are curious about how the Fourier transform works, which can transform images or other data into the frequency domain, give this a read: <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2016/08/11/understanding-the-discrete-fourier-transform/" rel="nofollow">https://blog.demofox.org/2016/08/11/understanding-the-discrete-fourier-transform/</a></p>



<p>The C++ code that goes with this blog post can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Atrix256/FrequencySpaceImages" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Atrix256/FrequencySpaceImages</a></p>



<h2>Image Compression</h2>



<p>When you transform an image into the frequency domain, you get a complex number (with a real and imaginary component) per pixel that you can use to get information about the frequencies (literal sine and cosine waves) that go into making the image.  One piece of information is the “phase” or starting angle of that wave.  You get the phase by using atan2(imaginary, real).  The other piece of information is the “amplitude” of that wave, or how large the wave is in the image. The amplitude is the length of the 2d vector (real, imaginary).</p>



<p>A quick and easy way to do image compression then, is to convert an image to frequency space, find the lowest amplitude frequencies and throw them away – literally zero out the complex number.  If you throw enough of them away, it’ll take less data to describe the frequency content of an image, than the pixels of the image, and you’ll have compressed the image.</p>



<p>The more aggressive you are at throwing away frequencies though, the more the image quality will degrade.  This is “lossy” compression and is a simplified version of how jpg image compression works.  Lossy compression is in contrast to lossless compression like you find in png files, which use something more like a .zip compression algorithm to perfectly encode all the source data.</p>



<p>In the code that goes with this post, the DoTestZeroing() function throws out the lowest 10% amplitude frequencies, then the lowest 20%, then 30% and so on up to 90%.  At each stage, it writes all complex frequency values out into a binary file, which can then be compressed using .zip as a method for realizing the image compression.  As the data gets more zeros, it gets more compressible.</p>



<p>The top row in the image below shows an original 512×1024 image, the DFT amplitude information, and the DFT phase information.  The bottom row shows the same, but for an image which has had it’s lower 90% amplitude frequencies thrown away.  The DFT data is 8MB for both (uncompressed), and compresses to 7.7MB for the top picture, but only 847KB for the bottom picture.  The inverse DFT was used to turn the modified frequency data on the bottom back into an image.</p>

<p>Here is another image which is 512×512 and has DFT which is 4MB uncompressed.  The top image’s DFT data compresses to 3.83MB, while the bottom compresses to 438KB.</p>

<p>While fairly effective, this is also a pretty naive way of doing frequency based image compression!</p>



<p>More sophisticated methods use the “Discrete Cosine Transform” or DCT instead of the DFT because it tends to make more of the frequency magnitudes zero, consolidating the data into fewer important frequencies, which means it’s already smaller before you start throwing away frequencies. DCT and DFT also pretend that the images go on forever, instead of just stopping at the edge.  DFT acts as if those images repeat in a tiled fashion, while DCT acts as if they are mirrored at each repeat, which can also be a nice property for image quality.</p>



<p>Other methods break an image up into blocks before doing frequency based compression.  Also, you can use wavelets to compress images, or principle component analysis or singular value decomposition.  You can also fit your image with “whatever” basis functions you want, using L1 norm regularization to promote the coefficients of your fitting to be zero, to make the fit data be less sparse, just like DCT does compared to DFT.</p>



<p>Another thing you can do is use compressed sensing to skip a couple steps: You take a couple randomized but roughly evenly spaced samples from the image (blue noise or LDS are going to be good options here), and then you can eg find Fourier basis coefficients (DFT!) that match the sparse/irregular data samples you took.   This is like throwing out low frequencies, but without having to DFT the whole data set, and then throw things out.  It starts with sparse data and then fits it.</p>



<p>Bart Wronski has several write ups on his blog in this area, so give them a read if you are interested: <a href="https://bartwronski.com/2020/08/30/compressing-pbr-texture-sets-with-sparsity-and-dictionary-learning/" rel="nofollow">https://bartwronski.com/2020/08/30/compressing-pbr-texture-sets-with-sparsity-and-dictionary-learning/</a></p>



<p>This is a great read showing how to fit data using L1 regularization and all the related information you might be interested in: <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/a-comprehensive-guide-for-linear-ridge-and-lasso-regression/" rel="nofollow">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/a-comprehensive-guide-for-linear-ridge-and-lasso-regression/</a></p>



<p>This video is a great overview of the random grab bag of other things I mentioned: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCyHbRIz44&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCyHbRIz44&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>



<h2>Image Filtering</h2>



<p>In my previous post on this topic I showed how you could throw away frequencies that were farther than a certain distance from the center to low pass filter an image, aka blur it.  I also showed how if you threw away frequencies closer than a certain distance, it would high pass filter an image, aka sharpen it.</p>



<p>That throwing away of frequency data based on distance is the same as multiplying the frequency data by a mask which has a 1.0 in some places and a 0.0 in others.  You can generalize this to multiply frequencies by any number.  In the below I restrict the multiplications to be between 0 and 1, but you could definitely go to larger numbers or even go to negative numbers if you wanted.</p>



<p>The below shows the patterns that the images are multiplied by in this section. Top row left to right is a low pass filter, then a stronger low pass filter (gets rid of more high frequencies than the other) and lastly is a notch filter or “band stop” filter.  The bottom row is the complement, such that you get the bottom by subtracting the image from white (1.0).  Left to right, the bottom row is a high pass filter, then a weaker high pass filter (lets more low frequencies in) and then a band pass filter which only lets certain frequencies through.</p>

<p>First up is the “Loki and Alan” picture. Frequencies and actual picture values filtered from the pictures on the top are present in the pictures on the bottom and vice versa. In this way, blurring compared to sharpening (and edge detection) are two sides of the same coin. It just matters which part you throw away and which part you keep.</p>

<p>Here is what the frequency magnitudes look like. Note that each image has the magnitudes put through a log function, and also normalized to be 1.0 max. This is why even though the high pass filters (and band pass) darken the middle, it doesn’t seem like it. The renormalization obscures that fact a bit, and the middle is brightest (largest amplitudes) which we saw when throwing out the lowest amplitudes in the last section.</p>

<h2>Image Convolution</h2>



<p>In the last section, we made “images” by using a distance function, to make values to multiply the frequencies by to filter out certain frequencies.</p>



<p>In this section, we are going to take two images, put them into frequency space, multiply them together, take them out of frequency space, and see what kind of results come out.</p>



<p>There is something called the “convolution theorem” which tells us that multiplication in the frequency domain, is the same as convolution between the images.  Convolution is an expensive operation, because you have to loop through all the pixels of one image, and at each pixel, loop through the pixels of the other image, and do some multiplications and additions. Convolution is so slow, that it can actually be quicker to take two images you want convolved to frequency domain, multiply them together, and then take them out of frequency space to be images again.</p>



<p>Convolution is used in graphics for things like blurs, sharpening, or applying bokeh for depth of field, so speeding it up can be a big help!  Convolution is also used in audio for things like reverberation which makes audio sound like it was played inside of a cave or a big cathedral.</p>



<p>Technical note: the “kernel” image needs to be centered at pixel (0,0), not the center of the image.  Also, the kernel image should be normalized so that summing up all of it’s pixels adds up to 1.0.  You also need to zero pad (add a black pixel border to) both the source image and kernel image to be the size of source+kernel+1 on the x and y axis before DFT’ing so they are the same size, and to avoid wrapping problems.  After you are done multiplying and inverse DFT’ing, you can remove the black border again.</p>



<p>Here are the 4 images we are going to use as kernel images: A star, a plus, a circle, and a blob.</p>

<p>Here are the DFT magnitudes of those images.</p>

<p>Here is the “Loki and Alan” picture convolved with those kernel images.</p>

<p>You can see that the images somehow take on the qualities of the kernel… the star one is very angular, the plus one is very “plus like” and the circular one is very circular.  Note how the blob acts a lot like a low pass filter!  In frequency space, it does actually look like one, so that makes sense:</p>

<p>If you think the above looks weird when doing convolution on images, you should give a listen to convolution being used in audio. When used for reverb it sounds good, and sounds correct, but if you use it to convolve arbitrary audio samples together, you can get some really …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>If there's nothing different about UNIX people, how come so many were liberal-arts majors?<br> It's the love of words that makes UNIX stand out.</strong></p>

<p><a href="mailto:scoville@hooked.net">Thomas Scoville</a></p>

<p>In the late 1980s, I worked in the advanced R&amp;D arm of the Silicon Valley's regional telephone company.  My lab was populated mostly by Ph.D.s and gifted hackers.  It was, as you might expect, an all-UNIX shop.</p>

<p>The manager of the group was an exception: no advanced degree, no technical credentials.  He seemed pointedly self-conscious about it.  We suspected he felt (wrongly, we agreed) underconfident of his education and intellect.  One day, a story circulated through the group that confirmed our suspicions: the manager had confided he was indeed intimidated by the intelligence of the group, and was taking steps to remedy the situation.  His prescription, though, was unanticipated: “I need to become more of an intellectual,” he said. “I'm going to learn UNIX.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, we made more than a little fun out of this.  I mean, come on: as if UNIX could transform him into a mastermind, like the supplicating scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.”  I uncharitably imagined a variation on the old Charles Atlas ads: “Those senior engineers will never kick sand in my face again.”</p>

<p>But part of me was sympathetic: “The boss isn't entirely wrong, is he?  There is something different about UNIX people, isn't there?” In the years since, I've come to recognize what my old manager was getting at.  I still think he was misguided, but in retrospect I think his belief was more accurate than I recognized at the time.</p>

<p>To be sure, the UNIX community has its own measure of technical parochialism and nerdy tunnel vision, but in my experience there seemed to be a suspicious overrepresentation of polyglots and liberal-arts folks in UNIX shops.  I'll admit my evidence is sketchy and anecdotal.  For instance, while banging out a line of shell, with a fellow engineer peering over my shoulder, I might make an intentionally obscure literary reference:</p>

<pre>if test -z `ps -fe | grep whom`
then 
echo ^G 
fi
# Let's see for whom the bell tolls.</pre>

<p>UNIX colleagues were much more likely to recognize and play in a way I'd never expect in the VMS shops, IBM's big-iron data centers, or DOS ghettos on my consulting beat.</p>

<p>Being a liberal-arts type myself (though I cleverly concealed this in my resume), I wondered why this should be true.  My original explanation — UNIX's historical association with university computing environments, like UC Berkeley's — didn't hold up over the years; many of the UNIX-philiacs I met came from schools with small or absent computer science departments.  There had to be a connection, but I had no plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>It wasn't until I started regularly asking UNIX refuseniks what they didn't like about UNIX that better explanations emerged.</p>

<p>Some of the prevailing dislike had a distinctly populist flavor — people caught a whiff of snobbery about UNIX and regarded it with the same proletarian resentment usually reserved for highbrow institutions like opera or ballet.  They had a point: until recently, UNIX was the <em>lingua franca</em> of computing's upper crust.  The more harried, practical, and underprivileged of the computing world seemed to object to this aura of privilege. UNIX adepts historically have been a coddled bunch, and tend to be proud of their hard-won knowledge.  But these class differences are fading fast in modern computing environments.  Now UNIX engineers are more common, and low- or no-cost UNIX variations run on inexpensive hardware.  Certainly UNIX folks aren't as coddled in the age of NT.</p>

<p>There was a standard litany of more specific criticisms: UNIX is difficult and time-consuming to learn.  There are too many things to remember.  It's arcane and needlessly complex.</p>

<p>But the most recurrent complaint was that it was too text-oriented.  People really hated the command line, with all the utilities, obscure flags, and arguments they had to memorize.  They hated all the typing.  One mislaid character and you had to start over.  Interestingly, this complaint came most often from users of the GUI-laden Macintosh or Windows platforms.  People who had slaved away on DOS batch scripts or spent their days on character-based terminals of multiuser non-UNIX machines were less likely to express the same grievance.</p>

<p>Though I understood how people might be put off by having to remember such willfully obscure utility names like cat and grep, I continued to be puzzled at why they resented typing.  Then I realized I could connect the complaint with the scores of “intellectual elite” (as my manager described them) in UNIX shops.  The common thread was wordsmithing; a suspiciously high proportion of my UNIX colleagues had already developed, in some prior career, a comfort and fluency with text and printed words.  They were adept readers and writers, and UNIX played handily to those strengths. UNIX was, in some sense, literature to them.  Suddenly the overrepresentation of polyglots, liberal-arts types, and voracious readers in the UNIX community didn't seem so mysterious, and pointed the way to a deeper issue: in a world increasingly dominated by image culture (TV, movies, <em>.jpg</em> files), UNIX remains rooted in the culture of the word.</p>

<p>UNIX programmers express themselves in a rich vocabulary of system utilities and command-line arguments, along with a flexible, varied grammar and syntax.  For UNIX enthusiasts, the language becomes second nature.  Once, I overheard a conversation in a Palo Alto restaurant: “there used to be a shrimp-and-pasta plate here under ten bucks.  Let me see... <code>cat menu | grep shrimp | test -lt $10</code>...” though not syntactically correct (and less-than-scintillating conversation), a diner from an NT shop probably couldn't have expressed himself as casually.</p>

<p>With UNIX, text — on the command line, STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR — is the primary interface mechanism: UNIX system utilities are a sort of Lego construction set for word-smiths.  Pipes and filters connect one utility to the next, text flows invisibly between.  Working with a shell, awk/lex derivatives, or the utility set is literally a word dance.</p>

<p>Working on the command line, hands poised over the keys uninterrupted by frequent reaches for the mouse, is a posture familiar to wordsmiths (especially the really old guys who once worked on teletypes or electric typewriters).  It makes some of the same demands as writing an essay.  Both require composition skills.  Both demand a thorough knowledge of grammar and syntax.  Both reward mastery with powerful, compact expression.</p>

<p>At the risk of alienating both techies and writers alike, I also suggest that UNIX offers something else prized in literature: a coherence, a consistent style, something writers call a voice.  It doesn't take much exposure to UNIX before you realize that the UNIX core was the creation of a very few well-synchronized minds.  I've never met Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, or Ken Thompson, but after a decade and a half on UNIX I imagine I might greet them as friends, knowing something of the shape of their thoughts.</p>

<p>You might argue that UNIX is as visually oriented as other OSs.  Modern UNIX offerings certainly have their fair share of GUI-based OS interfaces.  In practice though, the UNIX core subverts them; they end up serving UNIX's tradition of word culture, not replacing it.  Take a look at the console of most UNIX workstations: half the windows you see are terminal emulators with command-line prompts or vi jobs running within.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this word/image culture tension better represented than in the contrast between UNIX and NT.  When the much-vaunted UNIX-killer arrived a few years ago, backed by the full faith and credit of the Redmond juggernaut, I approached it with an open mind.  But NT left me cold.  There was something deeply unsatisfying about it.  I had that ineffable feeling (apologies to Gertrude Stein) there was no <em>there</em> there.  Granted, I already knew the major themes of system and network administration from my UNIX days, and I will admit that registry hacking did vex me for a few days, but after my short scramble up the learning curve I looked back at UNIX with the feeling I'd been demoted from a backhoe to a leaf-blower. NT just didn't offer room to move.  The one-size-fits-all, point-and-click, we've-already-anticipated-all-your-needs world of NT had me yearning for those obscure command-line flags and <code>man -k</code>.  I wanted to craft my own solutions from my own toolbox, not have my ideas slammed into the visually homogenous, prepackaged, Soviet world of Microsoft Foundation Classes.</p>

<p>NT was definitely much too close to image culture for my comfort: endless point-and-click graphical dialog boxes, hunting around the screen with the mouse, pop-up after pop-up demanding my attention.  The experience was almost exclusively reactive.  Every task demanded a GUI-based utility front-end loaded with insidious assumptions about how to visualize (and thus conceptualize) the operation.  I couldn't think “outside the box” because everything literally was a box.  There was no opportunity for ad hoc consideration of how a task might alternately be performed.</p>

<p>I will admit NT made my life easier in some respects.  I found myself doing less remembering (names of utilities, command arguments, syntax) and more recognizing (solution components associated with check boxes, radio buttons, and pull-downs).  I spent much less time typing.  Certainly my right hand spent much more time herding the mouse around the desktop.  But after a few months I started to get a tired, desolate feeling, akin to the fatigue I feel after too much channel surfing or videogaming: too much time spent reacting, not enough spent in active analysis and expression.  In short, image-culture burnout.</p>

<p>The one ray of light that illuminated my tenure in NT environments was the burgeoning popularity of …</p></div>

            <p>Five years ago, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ui-movement" target="_blank">I launched a little side project called UI Movement</a> which was a newsletter that featured five design animations every week. It's since grown in scope and popularity until the newsletter had close to 30,000 subscribers and the site was getting ~350,000 page views per month.</p><p>The featured designs came from various external sources, but one was by far the most popular. It made sense because that source was super well known amongst designers and it’s where they go to share their work.</p><p>The legal team from that website sent me a cease and desist for UI Movement a couple of months ago. Even though the featured designs always included attribution and links back to the original, they were clearly not happy that UI Movement was featuring content from their site. The email was a bit of a shock, but deep down I knew it could happen at any moment. Running a “curation” type site like UI Movement with most of the content coming from one source was always a risk.</p><p>I thought about making minor changes and hoping it would be enough, but decided to take a different approach.</p><p>The truth is, UI Movement is no longer a big part of my business and it was more of a passion project/hobby that I was slowly losing interest in. I was getting tired of featuring over-the-top design animations that would never make it into production or would be quite annoying for users if they did. While I still see value in finding inspiration from unrealistic designs, I wasn’t enjoying the process of curating them anymore.</p><p>Instead of shutting UI Movement down or making a few small tweaks, I decided to start from scratch and make a UI design inspiration site I could get excited about.</p><p>The end result is that UI Movement became <a href="https://screenlane.com/" target="_blank">Screenlane</a>: A site that features web &amp; mobile screenshots from live products for UI design inspiration. No more unrealistic prototypes. Admittedly, not the most innovative idea, but I believe I can get Screenlane to the point where it's providing as much or more value than UI Movement.</p><p>Screenlane has been live for ~3 weeks and I thought it would be a good time to share some numbers. This was more than a redesign or a rebrand with a domain change. It's all new content, a new domain, brand, and website. I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>Here are the numbers so far:<br></p><h2>The newsletter</h2><p>When the announcement email was sent, the newsletter had 29,662 subscribers. It now has 29,250 subscribers (a decrease of 412).</p><p>The announcement email included a big “unsubscribe” button after an explanation of the change and why it happened.<br></p><p>Since then, a couple more weekly newsletters have been sent and they both briefly mentioned the change. I'm hoping the number of unsubscribes will level off over time. 128 people have subscribed since the change, which is promising.</p><h2>Website traffic</h2><p>Traffic has dropped from ~15,000 users &amp; ~82,000 page views per week to ~8,000 users and ~38,000 page views per week.</p><p><img src="https://rocketgems.com/media/django-summernote/2020-11-04/a00341d1-3aaf-45d0-9a8e-728d22043ed9.png"><br></p><p>Traffic from <b>uimovement.com</b> is redirected to <b>screenlane.com?ref=uimovement</b>, which helps me track the trend of how much of the traffic is still attempting to go to UI Movement. I also submitted a "change of address" notice to Google through the&nbsp;Search Console.&nbsp;</p><h2><span>Reactions from subscribers</span></h2><p>I rarely heard from UI Movement subscribers until this change. At least half a dozen people have been in touch to let me know how how sad they are that UI Movement is essentially dead and how much value they got from it. A few people also shared some words of encouragement about the direction I've taken with Screenlane. It was both surprising and awesome to hear from subscribers. Honestly, I didn't expect as many people to be disappointed by the demise of UI Movement. I now feel a bit more pressure to make Screenlane great.</p><p>Overall, the decrease in newsletter subscribers is reasonably small, the drop in traffic is substantial, and the overall response to Screenlane is positive. I'm fairly happy with how things are going &amp; it will be interesting to see if I can stop the downward trend and start growing the traffic &amp; newsletter again.</p><p>It's been quite fun to make such a drastic change without worrying too much about the outcome. This whole situation would have been much worse if UI Movement was a significant part of the business or still drove a lot of traffic to <a href="https://pageflows.com/" target="_blank">Page Flows</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor Memory Introspection (HVMI) relies on analyzing memory accesses in order to determine whether they are legitimate or not. For example, by analyzing the old memory value and the newly stored value, HVMI can decide whether to allow the modification or not. This, however, introduces the complication of needing to do an in-depth analysis of each instruction that modifies protected memory. Unlike a RISC architecture, x86 has a large number of instructions that may access memory in a complicated, read-modify-write (RMW) manner, and using complicated addressing schemes.
In order to simplify instruction decoding and analysis, a dedicated x86 instruction decoder has been created, capable of providing full instruction information, and thus alleviating the HVMI module from needing to know x86 instructions format. This blog post will detail some bddisasm internals, how to work with it, while highlighting why it is a critical part of HVMI. In addition, we will go through some particularities of x86 instruction encoding. The main bddisasm project is located <a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/bddisasm">here</a>, and the documentation can be accessed <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bddisasm-overview">bddisasm Overview</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a standalone library, written in C, with some Python used for internal decoder-tables generation. The library is built to be fast, while providing as much information about the decoded instructions as possible - this is important, because other projects using bddisasm can rely on it to provide complete and accurate information about instructions. When considering other decoding libraries, there are only some which are similar in features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://intelxed.github.io/">Intel Xed</a>, which is written and maintained by Intel, thus somehow making it the standard x86 decoder; while not the fastest, it provides rich information about the decoded instructions;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/aquynh/capstone">Capstone</a>, which is basically a collection of decoders for multiple architectures;</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a>, which is comparable to Xed as far as features go, and lightweight (however, when bddisasm was created internally, ZyDis did not exist yet);</li>
</ul>

<p>Other decoders written in other languages, such as Rust or C#, or disassembler (which only provide a textual output of the instruction, without providing actual decoded instruction information) were not considered. Given that Xed and Capstone seemed rather difficult to work with at that time, we decided to create a lightweight decoder of our own, with the following objectives in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightweight - written entirely in C, with no external dependencies, no memory allocated, and thread-safe by design;</li>
  <li>Fast - while we needed a decoder capable of providing as much information as possible about instructions, we still considered speed an important factor;</li>
  <li>Resilient - the decoder should be able to handle all kinds of malformed instructions, as well as valid instructions containing redundant prefixes, or encodings which are not typical;</li>
  <li>Complete - the decoder must support all existing x86 instructions, including AVX; moreover, extending the support to new instructions should be as simple as possible;</li>
  <li>Easy to work with - single-header file, single-API library, which provides all possible information in the output decoded instruction, without the need to call additional functions in order to extract information from the decoded instruction;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not get into a comparison between bddisasm and other decoding libraries, and we will keep the focus of this blog post on how to work with bddisasm and how useful it is in HVMI.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-bddisasm">Working With bddisasm</h2>

<p>Working with the decoding library is easy: include the <code>bddisasm.h</code> header file, link with the <code>bddisasm.lib</code> (Windows) or <code>libbddisasm.a</code> (Linux), and call the decoding API! bddisasm uses a single-API decoding scheme, where the <code>NdDecode</code> APIs provide an output <code>INSTRUX</code> structure containing all the possible information about the instruction. The only thing not included in the <code>INSTRUX</code> structure is the textual disassembly of the instruction, which has to be generated separately using the <code>NdToText</code> API. A typical usage scenario might be the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "bddisasm/bddisasm.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
     <span>INSTRUX</span> <span>ix</span><span>;</span>
     <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>ins</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>0x33</span><span>,</span> <span>0xC0</span> <span>};</span>
     <span>NDSTATUS</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

     <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>NdDecodeEx</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>ins</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>ins</span><span>),</span> <span>ND_CODE_64</span><span>,</span> <span>ND_DATA_64</span><span>);</span>
     <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>ND_SUCCESS</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>))</span>
     <span>{</span>
         <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoding failed with error 0x%08x!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>);</span>
         <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>}</span>

     <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Decoded instruction with length %d!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ix</span><span>.</span><span>Length</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="decoded-instruction-information">Decoded Instruction Information</h3>

<p>Note that the output <code>INSTRUX ix</code> structure will contain <em>all</em> the information about the decoded instruction. A comprehensive list about what kind of information you can find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw information about the instruction, such as prefixes, opcodes, modrm, SIB, displacement, immediate fields;</li>
  <li>Information about operand size, address size, vector length;</li>
  <li>Decoded prefix information, such as whether the instruction uses lock, is repeated, is xacquire/xrelease enabled or CET tracked;</li>
  <li>Length information, including about the instruction itself and different fields of the instruction, such as immediate fields or displacement;</li>
  <li>Offset information about each constituent field of the instruction (position of each field inside the instruction);</li>
  <li>Individual RFLAGS flags access mode: modified, tested, set, cleared and undefined;</li>
  <li>FPU flags access for <code>C0</code>, <code>C1</code>, <code>C2</code> and <code>C3</code> flags;</li>
  <li>AVX information, such as instruction exception class, tuple type, and rounding mode;</li>
  <li>Instruction category (example: CALL, RET, ARITH, LOGIC, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction set (example: I86, I64, MMX, SSE4, etc.);</li>
  <li>CPUID feature flag, which indicates the leaf and subleaf that must be queried, together with the register and bit which indicates support for that particular instruction;</li>
  <li>Valid operating modes for the instruction (example: real, protected, long, VMX root, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid prefixes for the instruction (example: REP, LOCK, etc.);</li>
  <li>Valid decorators for AVX instructions (example: masking, broadcast, rounding, etc.);</li>
  <li>Instruction Mnemonic;</li>
  <li>Operand information, including: operand type, size, access (read, conditional read, write, conditional write) and details;</li>
  <li>Full memory operand details: segment, base, index, scale, compressed displacement, stack, string, bitbase, VSIB, etc.);</li>
  <li>Implicit operands information: registers, implicit memory locations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples on how different kind if info can be extracted from <code>INSTRUX</code> can be found on the <a href="https://bddisasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official documentation page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="textual-disassembly">Textual Disassembly</h3>

<p>Using the <code>NdToText</code> function, one can convert a decoded <code>INSTRUX</code> to a textual disassembly that can be printed. The <code>NdToText</code> function only supports Intel style syntax, so the following instruction <code>33C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       eax, eax</code>, and <code>4833C0</code> would be decoded as <code>XOR       rax, rax</code>. Typical usage of the <code>NdToText</code> function is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// Create the text disassembly for this instruction.</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>text</span><span>[</span><span>ND_MIN_BUF_SIZE</span><span>];</span>

    <span>NdToText</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ix</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>),</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Instruction: %s</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bddisasm-in-hvmi">bddisasm in HVMI</h2>

<p>bddisasm is a critical part of the HVMI technology. As mentioned, decoding and analyzing instructions is important, since the vast majority of events HVMI is dealing with are EPT violations (memory-referencing instructions).</p>

<p>One of the first things HVMI does when an EPT violation takes place is to decode the offending instruction. Since accessing guest memory is usually slow (as it involves translating the guest linear address to a guest physical address, and mapping each physical page in the process - both page-tables and the actual page), once an instruction is decoded, it gets cached internally. Subsequent accesses from the same instruction pointer would yield an already decoded, cached instruction, thus speeding up this process (of course, caching instructions also implies that the pages containing them have to be monitored for modifications, in order to invalidate the cache if an instruction is modified).</p>

<p>Once the instruction has been decoded, HVMI will dissect it in order to determine each memory location accessed. This is important, because one instruction may directly, or indirectly, access multiple memory locations, and we have to analyze each access before allowing the instruction to continue. Since bddisasm provides full operand information (including implicit operands), HVMI will basically iterate through all the instruction operands, and check if they’re memory. For each memory operand, it would then make sure that it accesses a region of memory that is not monitored by HVMI. Examples of instructions that access multiple addresses might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CALL [mem]</code> - it reads the <code>[mem]</code> operand, and it writes the stack; it may also access the shadow stack, if CET Shadow Stack is enabled;</li>
  <li><code>MOVS</code> - it reads memory from <code>[rsi]</code>, and writes memory to <code>[rdi]</code>;</li>
  <li>AVX instruction using VSIB addressing - multiple addresses may be accessed by a VSIB operand such as <code>[rax+xmm0*8]</code>;</li>
  <li>MPX instructions <code>BNDLDX</code> and <code>BNDSTX</code>, which access the bounds tables;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some events (mostly asynchronous) which may cause EPT violations, even if the current instruction does not do any kind of memory access; such events include:</p>

<ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I'll discuss 5 very confusing mistakes that have caused me to waste significant amounts of time when using the command-line tool known as 'grep' to search for things. &nbsp;I have chosen to document these mistakes in detail because they are mistakes that beginners are very likely to make at some point, but also to not be able to debug on their own. &nbsp;The root causes of these mistakes are: &nbsp;Not knowing what flavour of regular expression that grep is currently using (and/or not understanding what features that flavour supports); Not considering the escaping rules of your shell; Issues with character encodings.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a file containing a few lines of text that we'll place inside the file 'hello.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
Goodbye World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that you wanted to use the 'grep' command to find all lines in this file that contain the word 'Hello' followed by the word 'World'. &nbsp;You could use a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.*World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you expect, this grep command found all of the matches that you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
HelloWorld.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now you might consider adding the additional requirement that there be at least one character between 'Hello' and 'World' so that the line with 'HelloWorld' is not included in the matches. &nbsp;Since you know that '*' is a regex pattern for 'zero or more' and '+' is a regex pattern for 'oen or more', you decide to try the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.+World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this doesn't match anything at all! &nbsp;What's going on here? &nbsp;Isn't '+' a regular expression symbol for 'one or more'? &nbsp;The answer is related to the default regular expression mode that grep uses. &nbsp;If you don't specify any flags to grep, it will use 'BRE' or 'Basic Regular Expressions' which are very old and quite primitive. &nbsp;In fact, the official <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">standard for BRE</a> doesn't even support the '+' quantifier! &nbsp;This can lead to very confusing behaviour since you might just try escaping the '+' and find that it gives you the result you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello.</span><span>\+</span><span>World</span><span>"</span> hello.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives the following:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World.
Hello There World.
Hello Some World.
Hello The World.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we're still using 'BRE' regular expressions, the official standard says that this is actually undefined behaviour! &nbsp;You can learn more about this in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/grep-bre-ere-perl-regular-expressions/">Undefined Behaviour With Grep -E</a>.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say we have a file called 'sometext.txt' with the following text in it:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.

Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wanted to find all lines in this file that contains the word 'date', you could use this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> date sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll get the following result which is what you expect:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
Today's date is Oct 21, 2020.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, let's assume you wanted to use grep to only find the line that contain the backtick characters around the word 'date'. &nbsp;You might try doing the following:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>`date`</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this just generates a bunch of error messages in the shell:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span>: Oct: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>21</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span>: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: EST: No such file or directory
<span>grep</span>: <span>2020</span>: No such file or directory
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be thinking, "Oh, no problem, I'll just use double quotes" and try something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that <em>still</em> doesn't work (at least not in bash)! &nbsp;It doesn't find any matches at all! &nbsp;The problem in this case is related to the fact that the backtick character has a special meaning in our shell, even when used inside double quotes. &nbsp;To illustrate this point, we can run the following two echo commands:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>date</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>`date`</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the output of these echo statements is:</p>

<p><code><pre>date
Mon Oct  <span>21</span> <span>13</span>:<span>30</span>:<span>57</span> EST <span>2020</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from reading the results above example, you can see why the grep command we last used didn't find anything:  We were literally searching for the current date instead of the word 'date' surrounded by backticks! &nbsp;The solution (in bash shell), is to use single-quotes instead:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>'</span><span>`date`</span><span>'</span> sometext.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will match correctly as expected:</p>

<p><code><pre>Make sure you write out the `date`.
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't the only issue that you can encounter where your shell could unexpectedly change the meaning of the search string that you pass into grep. &nbsp;You can also encounter an issue with <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">unexpected 'globbing'</a> when you attempt to use a regular expression containing the '*' character without using quotes. &nbsp;For example, consider this simple echo statement that just prints out 'asdf':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you filter this echo statement through a grep search for the character 'a' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the search will pass the line 'asdf' through as expected. &nbsp;And similarly, if you do a regex search with grep for an 'a' followed by any number of other characters like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also let the 'asdf' through. &nbsp;However, if you create a new file in the current directory called 'a.txt':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>touch</span> a.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following search won't work anymore! &nbsp;It doesn't find anything:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>asdf</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> a.*
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!? &nbsp;How can creating a new file change how our grep commands run in the shell??? &nbsp;This problem is explained in detail in <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/find-command-wildcard-globbing/">this article on shell globbing</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mistake isn't specific to grep since it's really about regular expressions in general, but it's common enough to include in this article. &nbsp;Consider a case where you're trying to use grep to extract all instances of numbers that include a decimal point. &nbsp;In your search, you're looking for one or more digits, followed by a period, followed by one or more digits. &nbsp;You might try writing a grep command like this:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which looks like it works just fine because it does match all of the things you do want. &nbsp;The problem is that is also matches things that you <em>don't</em> want:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+.[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above case, our regular expression will match the pattern '234A328' which isn't a decimal point number. &nbsp;This case becomes obvious when you point it out, since the '.' character usually represents "any character except for newline" in most regular expressions engines. &nbsp;In order to match a 'literal' period character in a regular expression, you need to escape it:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234A328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>

<span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>234.328</span><span>"</span><span> </span>| <span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>\.</span><span>[0-9]+</span><span>"</span>
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is to be careful when using searches that include a '.' character, since it may not always literally mean a period character.</p>




<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is some text that we'll place inside a file called 'animals.txt'. &nbsp;Take note that the two 'columns' in this file are separated with tab (\t) characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person	Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert	Cat
Alexander	Dog
Sam	Monkey
Michael	Snake
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we wanted to write a grep statement to extract the first column from this file. &nbsp;We could do this quickly and crudely by writing a regular expression that will extract anything up and including the tab character. &nbsp;Here's an attempt to do this with the following grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you run this, you'll get results that are completely wrong:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is, again, because of grep's default regular expression mode: BRE or 'Basic Regular Expressions'. &nbsp;However, if we try using the -E flag for 'Extended Regular Expressions', this doesn't fix the problem:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Eo</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still gives:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person  Favourite Animal\Pet
Robert  Cat
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if you check the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html">official standard for BRE and ERE</a>, you'll see that it has no support for matching just a 'tab' character! &nbsp;In POSIX BRE or ERE, there are just a handful of characters that you can escape with a backslash, and they don't include tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusingly, GNU grep <em>does</em> support things like '\s' in ERE even though it's not officially supported by the POSIX standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution in our case is to use the -P flag for 'Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions':</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> <span>-Po</span> <span>"</span><span>.*</span><span>\t</span><span>"</span> animals.txt
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which gives us the expected result:</p>

<p><code><pre>Person
Robert
Alexander
Sam
Michael
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the '-P' flag is not supported by all version of grep, so this solution isn't always available.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is one that you won't encounter every day, but when you do it can be <em>extremely</em> confusing to figure out what's going on. &nbsp;If you ever happen to work with files that are encoded in UTF-16, you'll have to be mindful of the fact that grep isn't aware of character encodings, so whatever you grep for will likely only be found if it's in a character encoding that matches the current encoding of the terminal where you type the grep command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, imagine that you have two files: the first file encoded in UTF-8 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 123!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second file encoded in UTF-16 contains this text:</p>

<p><code><pre>Hello World 456!
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my machine, if I do a grep search over both of these files using this grep command:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>grep</span> World *
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will only match the statement in the first file!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact isn't too surprising when you know what's going on, but the difficult part is noticing that you've got a file that's encoded in a different format in the first place. &nbsp;If you take regular ASCII characters and re-encode them as UTF-16, the file you get will look like regular ASCII encoded text with nulls placed between the characters. &nbsp;Therefore, if you print the file  onto the terminal, the nulls will be ignored and what you see printed will look indistinguishable from regular ASCII text (except for the byte order marker). &nbsp;Programs like vim will automatically recognize the encoding and display the file as normal text, so you likely won't notice the encoding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to identify the encoding of files is to use …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h3 id="recon"><strong>Recon</strong></h3>
<p>While browsing Starbucks Singapore, I noticed a page loaded with content from a 3rd party site. Let’s call this site <em>example.com</em> in order not to disclose it. When I did some research on this site, I saw the same login page on <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> in the directory example.com/starbucks, and at this point I had two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>This application can be an environment where current developments of <em>card.starbucks.com.sg</em> are made and tested.</li>
<li>Or it may have been used as an old test environment and is in an idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both possibilities increased the probability of a bug here, but the main problem is that I did not know whether a bug I will find here would affect the production environment. To understand this, I created a user account at card.starbucks.com.sg and tried to log into example.com/starbucks with this account. BINGO! I was able to successfully login with the account I just created. Both applications seemed to be using the same authentication mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kamilonurozkaleli.com/images/starbucks-1.png" alt="Scheme-1, both applications are using same database table."></p>
<h3 id="exploitation"><strong>Exploitation</strong></h3>
<p>From this point I browsed example.com/starbucks and discovered an endpoint which does not exist in the production app. The POST data this endpoint received was as follows.</p>
<p><code>email=hacker@hacker.com</code></p>
<p>When I write the email address of the account I want to takeover in the email parameter here and send a request, I saw the partial information of the account belonging to that email address on my profile page. I could not fully takeover the account yet, and my password change request was not successful due to the invalid CSRF token generated in this application.</p>
<p>To get around this, I copied the PHPSESSID cookie value from example.com/starbucks to card.starbucks.com.sg and BOOM! I was able to see all the information belongs to victim in the production environment, the valid CSRF tokens generated here allowed me to change the password and I was able to completely takeover an account whose e-mail address I know.</p>
<h3 id="impact"><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Except for seeing all personal information belonging to users and completely taking over the accounts, if there is a loaded credit in the user account, these credits can be spent in Starbucks stores via the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="multiplying-the-reward"><strong>Multiplying the Reward</strong></h3>
<p>I came across two other test environments on example.com. Let’s call them <em>example.com/starbucks2</em> and <em>example.com/starbucks3</em>. With my account at card.starbucks.com.sg, I was not able to login to either test environment. example.com/starbucks2 did not allow me to create a new account, so I tried my luck at example.com/starbucks3 and successfully created a new account. Things get a little complicated here, I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>I think the applications example.com/starbucks2 and example.com/starbucks3 were using test tables, so users in production could not login in these applications.</p>
<p>With the account I created at example.com/starbucks3, I was able to log in to example.com/starbucks2, but not card.starbucks.com.sg. However, the PHPSESSID I copied from example.com/starbucks2 was valid on card.starbucks.com.sg and I could use that account. Considering all the scenarios, I created a chain here as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dummy account with the victim’s email address at example.com/starbucks3. (Add to testusers table.)</li>
<li>At example.com/starbucks2, associate the account for that email with your own account via the same endpoint. (Associate the PHPSESSID with the email in the testusers table.)</li>
<li>Copy the PHPSESSID to card.starbucks.com.sg and takeover. (Takeover the real account of the same email address in the production users table.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Linux Commands Handbook follows the 80/20 rule: you’ll learn 80% of a topic in around 20% of the time you spend studying it.</p>
<p>I find that this approach gives you a well-rounded overview.</p>
<p>This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.</p>
<p>All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.</p>
<p>I hope the contents of this handbook will help you achieve what you want: <strong>getting comfortable with Linux</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h2 id="introductiontolinuxandshells">Introduction to Linux and shells</h2>
<h3 id="whatislinux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>It is also the most popular Open Source operating system, and it gives you a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It’s the base upon which everything is built. But not just that. Android is based on (a modified version of) Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux “core” (called a <em>kernel</em>) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it has come a really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>There’s one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with your computer.</p>
<p>They’re actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens, especially on the mobile side.</p>
<p>Linux is the ultimate freedom.</p>
<p>It is developed by volunteers, some paid by companies that rely on it, some independently. But there’s no single commercial company that can dictate what goes into Linux, or the project’s priorities.</p>
<p>You can also use Linux as your day to day computer. I use macOS because I really enjoy the applications and design (and I also used to be an iOS and Mac apps developer). But before using macOS I used Linux as my main computer Operating System.</p>
<p>No one can dictate which apps you can run, or “call home” with apps that track you, your position, and more.</p>
<p>Linux is also special because there’s not just “one Linux”, like is the case with Windows or macOS. Instead, we have <strong>distributions</strong>.</p>
<p>A “distro” is made by a company or organization and packages the Linux core with additional programs and tooling.</p>
<p>For example you have Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, probably the most popular distributions.</p>
<p>But many, many more exist. You can create your own distribution, too. But most likely you’ll use a popular one that has lots of users and a community of people around it. This lets you do what you need to do without losing too much time reinventing the wheel and figuring out answers to common problems.</p>
<p>Some desktop computers and laptops ship with Linux preinstalled. Or you can install it on your Windows-based computer, or on a Mac.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to disrupt your existing computer just to get an idea of how Linux works.</p>
<p>I don’t have a Linux computer.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, you just need to know that under the hood macOS is a UNIX Operating System. It shares a lot of the same ideas and software that a GNU/Linux system uses, because GNU/Linux is a free alternative to UNIX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNIX</a> is an umbrella term that groups many operating systems used in big corporations and institutions, starting from the 70’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The macOS terminal gives you access to the same exact commands I’ll describe in the rest of this handbook.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> which you can (and should!) install on Windows. This will give you the ability to run Linux in a very easy way on your PC.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of the time you will run a Linux computer in the cloud via a VPS (Virtual Private Server) like DigitalOcean.</p>
<h3 id="whatisashell">What is a shell?</h3>
<p>A shell is a command interpreter that exposes an interface to the user to work with the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users advanced features like being able to create scripts.</p>
<p>This is important: shells let you perform things in a more optimized way than a GUI (Graphical User Interface) could ever possibly let you do. Command line tools can offer many different configuration options without being too complex to use.</p>
<p>There are many different kind of shells. This post focuses on Unix shells, the ones that you will find commonly on Linux and macOS computers.</p>
<p>Many different kind of shells were created for those systems over time, and a few of them dominate the space: Bash, Csh, Zsh, Fish and many more!</p>
<p>All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called <code>sh</code>. “Bourne” because its creator was Steve Bourne.</p>
<p>Bash means <em>Bourne-again shell</em>. <code>sh</code> was proprietary and not open source, and Bash was created in 1989 to create a free alternative for the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. Since projects had to pay to use the Bourne shell, Bash became very popular.</p>
<p>If you use a Mac, try opening your Mac terminal. By default it runs ZSH (or, pre-Catalina, Bash).</p>
<p>You can set up your system to run any kind of shell – for example I use the Fish shell.</p>
<p>Each single shell has its own unique features and advanced usage, but they all share a common functionality: they can let you execute programs, and they can be programmed.</p>
<p>In the rest of this handbook we’ll see in detail the most common commands you will use.</p>

<h2 id="the-man-command">The <code>man</code> command</h2>
<p>The first command I’ll introduce will help you understand all the other commands.</p>
<p>Every time I don’t know how to use a command, I type <code>man &lt;command&gt;</code> to get the manual:</p>

<p>This is a man (from <em>_manual_</em>) page. Man pages are an essential tool to learn as a developer. They contain so much information that sometimes it’s almost too much.<br>The above screenshot is just 1 of 14 screens of explanation for the <code>ls</code> command.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I need to learn a command quickly I use this site called <strong>tldr pages</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tldr.sh</a>. It’s a command you can install, which you then run like this: <code>tldr &lt;command&gt;</code>. It gives you a very quick overview of a command, with some handy examples of common usage scenarios:</p>

<p>This is not a substitute for <code>man</code>, but a handy tool to avoid losing yourself in the huge amount of information present in a <code>man</code> page. Then you can use the <code>man</code> page to explore all the different options and parameters you can use on a command.</p>
<h2 id="the-ls-command">The <code>ls</code> command</h2>

<p>Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder contains using the <code>ls</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder’s contents:</p>
<pre><code>ls /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.50.14.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><code>ls</code> accepts a lot of options. One of my favorite combinations is <code>-al</code>. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>ls -al /bin
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-02-09-at-18.49.52.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Compared to the plain <code>ls</code> command, this returns much more information.</p>
<p>You have, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)</li>
<li>the number of links to that file</li>
<li>the owner of the file</li>
<li>the group of the file</li>
<li>the file size in bytes</li>
<li>the file’s last modified datetime</li>
<li>the file name</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of data is generated by the <code>l</code> option. The <code>a</code> option instead also shows the hidden files.</p>
<p>Hidden files are files that start with a dot (<code>.</code>).</p>

<h2 id="thecdcommand">The <code>cd</code> command</h2>
<p>Once you have a folder, you can move into it using the <code>cd</code> command. <code>cd</code> means <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory. You invoke it specifying a folder to move into. You can specify a folder name, or an entire path.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
cd fruits
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are in the <code>fruits</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>..</code> special path to indicate the parent folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd .. #back to the home folder
</code></pre>
<p>The # character indicates the start of the comment, which lasts for the entire line after it’s found.</p>
<p>You can use it to form a path:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
mkdir cars
cd fruits
cd ../cars
</code></pre>
<p>There is another special path indicator which is <code>.</code>, and indicates the <strong>current</strong> folder.</p>
<p>You can also use absolute paths, which start from the root folder <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-pwd-command">The <code>pwd</code> command</h2>

<p>Whenever you feel lost in the filesystem, call the <code>pwd</code> command to know where you are:</p>
<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>
<p>It will print the current folder path.</p>

<h2 id="the-mkdir-command">The <code>mkdir</code> command</h2>

<p>You create folders using the <code>mkdir</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can create multiple folders with one command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir dogs cars
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the <code>-p</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p fruits/apples
</code></pre>
<p>Options in UNIX commands commonly take this form. You add them right after the command name, and they change how the command behaves. You can often combine multiple options, too.</p>
<p>You can find which options a command supports by typing <code>man &lt;commandname&gt;</code>. Try now with <code>man mkdir</code> for example (press the <code>q</code> key to esc the man page). Man pages are the amazing built-in help for UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="the-rmdir-command">The <code>rmdir</code> command</h2>

<p>Just as you can create a folder using <code>mkdir</code>, you can delete a folder using <code>rmdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits
rmdir fruits
</code></pre>
<p>You can also delete multiple folders at once:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir fruits cars
rmdir fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>The folder you delete must be empty.</p>
<p>To delete folders with files in them, we’ll use the more generic <code>rm</code> command which deletes files and folders, using the <code>-rf</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf fruits cars
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful as this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediately remove anything you ask it to remove.</p>
<p>There is no <strong>bin</strong> when removing files from the command line, and recovering lost files can be hard.</p>

<h2 id="the-mv-command">The <code>mv</code> command</h2>

<p>Once you have a file, you can move it around using the <code>mv</code> command. You specify the file current path, and its new path:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
mv pear new_pear
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pear</code> file is now moved to <code>new_pear</code>. This is how you <strong>rename</strong> files and folders.</p>
<p>If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder. In this case, you can specify a list of files and they will all be moved in the folder path identified by the last parameter:</p>
<pre><code>touch pear
touch apple
mkdir fruits
mv pear apple fruits #pear and apple moved to the fruits folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-cp-command">The <code>cp</code> command</h2>

<p>You can copy a file using the <code>cp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>touch test
cp apple another_apple
</code></pre>
<p>To copy folders you need to add the <code>-r</code> option to …</p></div></div>

		<p>What do Microsoft <i>really</i> think about open-source?</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to multiple online sources, the leaked source code was from GitHub <em>Enterprise</em>, not the version hosted at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. While a substantial amount of code is shared between the two, they do have some differences.</p>
<p>The entirety of the confidential source code used by GitHub Enterprise has just been leaked to the public.</p>
<p>In a suspicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201104050026if_/https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/565ece486c7c1652754d7b6d2b5ed9cb4097f9d5">commit</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca">official GitHub DMCA repository</a>, an unknown individual uploaded the confidential source code, impersonating Nat Friedman using a bug in GitHub's application.</p>
<p>At the heart of open-source, GitHub has long been criticised for keeping its source code private. The platform hosts millions of open-source projects, and critics say GitHub's position is somewhat hypocritical.</p>
<p>However, this raises questions around the security of GitHub's source code, and whether or not GitHub have anything to lose, if they do plan to release the source code in a public setting.</p>
<p>Some worry this will damage the overall security of GitHub, and this may be true. Commonly, closed-source applications perform "security by obscurity". This means the source code is hidden, with the intention of concealing security risks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/17954714/microsoft-github-deal-acquisition-complete">acquisition of GitHub</a> in 2018, Microsoft have repeatedly emphasised their "love" for open-source. We have seen this through repeated commercial advertisements, which aim to place Microsoft at the forefront of open-source development.</p>
<p>Some users, such as Drew DeVault, suggest Microsoft is attempting to <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/27/Microsoft-plays-their-hand.html">centralise open-source</a>. Through closed-source applications, and proprietary extensions to Git, GitHub is seen as a platform that tries to <em>contain</em> open-source. An example of this is when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306674/github-down-errors-outage-june-2020">GitHub went offline for two hours</a>, leaving thousands of open-source projects inaccessible and unusable.</p>
<p>GitHub is, in many ways, the Google of open-source development.</p>
<p>Perhaps GitHub as 12 years late in finally revealing their source code to the public; and maybe this is just what we need. <a href="https://mastodon.tedomum.net/@resynth1943">What do you think?</a></p>

<![CDATA[IPv6 Is a Nightmare]]>

November 4, 2020 | https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://teknikaldomain.me/post/ipv6-is-a-total-nightmare/">archive.org</a>

<div>


<p>So this is just going to be a total rant.
IPv6 is, in theory, a solution to many things, including the dwindling IPv4 address space.
IPv6 was a draft in 1997(!), and became a real <em>Internet Standard</em> in 2017.
And, quite frankly, it’s one of those things that just adds too much hassle for not enough benefit.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, IPv6’s address space is <em><strong>massive.</strong></em>
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for 4,294,967,296 total addresses.
IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, meaning… 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The entire v4 space could fit into the v6 space $7.922816251426434 \times 10^{28}$ times over.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The default allocation to people, a <code>/64</code>, meaning the first half of the addresses is fixed and the entire second half is the part unique to the network, means that most people have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses to play with at home.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Compared to v4, where <em>most</em> networks are around <code>/24</code>, meaning the first three groupings are fixed, you get… 254 addresses.
Again, context, a standard <code>/64</code> allocation can, <em>again</em>, fit the entire v4 address space inside itself 4,294,967,296 times. (Yes, that’s the number of addresses <em>in</em> the IPv4 address space. That’s what happens when you divide a power by half of that power.)</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are, well, sparse, given that most high-level authorities have already run out of addresses, but because CIDR and NAT are a thing, we’ve really started compacting down our usage.
<em>My entire house</em> of easily over 60 IPs takes up… 2, according to the rest of the world.</p>
<h2 id="allocation-issues">Allocation Issues</h2>
<p>One thing that people have criticized IPv4 for is that the allocations are just horrible.
For example, <em>anything</em> starting with <code>127</code> is <code>localhost</code>.
normally this is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, but anything from <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> all mean the <strong>exact same thing.</strong>
That’s 16,777,216 addresses all <em>literally for <code>localhost</code>.</em>
By numbers, 0.39% of the address space, but just keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, anything starting with a <code>0</code>, is effectively “current network” (only valid as source), again, another 16 million addresses.</p>
<p>There’s also multiple blocks for private networks, <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>, <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code>.
In total, 17,891,328 addresses.</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, yes, IPv6 is much better… in theory.
There’s only <em>one</em> loopback address, <code>::1</code>.
At the same time… <code>fc00::/7</code> (26,58,455,991,569,831,745,807,614,120,560,689,152 addresses) is the private address space (more on that later), <code>fe80::/10</code> (332,306,998,946,228,968,225,951,765,070,086,144 addresses) is the <em>local</em> address space, and <code>ff00::/8</code> (1,329,227,995,784,915,872,903,807,060,280,344,576 addresses.) is multicast.
yes, do you see a recurring pattern?
Even though the entire “special” address assignments are exactly 1.271% of the entire IPv6 address space, we’re still allocating <strong>giant</strong> swathes of addresses.
History repeats itself, you can see that <em>right here.</em></p>
<p>And I will admit, that multicast in IPv6 is special since some bits in the address are special flags, and one form of multicast actually includes a response node’s address, so it’s not <em>just</em> an arbitrary number, but… come on, that’s a little uncalled for, having <em>that much</em> space.</p>

<p>We all know what an IPv4 address looks like, right?
Four dotted-decimal grouping in the range from 0–255.
For example, <code>192.168.5.225</code>.
IPv6 uses <em>eight</em> groupings of four <em>hex</em> digits, colon-separated.
For example, <code>2607:f0d0:1002:0051:0000:0000:0000:0004</code>.
That’s… very unweildy, so we have a few shortening rules.
Any zeros that <em>lead</em> the droup can be dropped, giving us this: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51:0:0:0:4</code>.
And since <em>that</em> is still repetitive, you can replace <em>exactly one</em> sequence of <em>more than one group</em> of all zeros with an empty: <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code>.
For the record this is why the loopback address is <code>::1</code>.
The full address is <code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</code>.
Even with those methods, they’re still <em>much</em> longer, harder to remember, and harder to even say than IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>And remember that this address violates the URL spec, since the <code>:</code> character is specifically to be used to separate the <em>host</em> portion (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) from the <em>port</em> to connect to (assuming nonstandard).
As an example, I can reach my torrent client via <code>http://192.168.5.43:9091</code>.
See that <code>:</code> there?
Because Transmission listens on port 9091, not port 80.
How do we fix this?
Well, by breaking it again, naturally.
To connect to a raw IPv6 address, you wrap it in square brackets.
To connect to <code>2607:f0d0:1002:51::4</code> directly, that’s <code>http://[2607:f0d0:1002:51::4]/</code>
<strong>Why is this a thing?!</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>okay, admittedly, IPv6 kinda relies on DNS since… just about everything uses DNS, and of course, actual names are more memorable than 32 hexadecimal digits, but DNS isn’t magic.
Unless you have your own DNS server (actually not that hard) that’s configured, you’re still manually typing addresses.
Of course if you have, say, pfSense managing your network, every static DHCP lease will be registered in DNS, but it has to take a DHCP lease.
And if this device doesn’t… well, I hope you don’t mind typing that out by hand to connect so you can configure it.</p>
<p>Even better, rDNS.
rDNS, or Reverse DNS, is where a DNS query is performed <em>with an IP address</em> that returns the hostname associated, in a <code>PTR</code> record.
For example, the IPv4 that <code>google.com</code> resolves to, <code>216.58.192.142</code>, can be queried as <code>142.192.58.216.in-addr.arpa</code> to get it’s “real” name, a <code>PTR</code> record for <code>ord36s01-in-f142.1e100.net</code>.
With <code>dig</code>, specifying a <code>-x</code> and then the IP will convert it to the correct format.
And if you look close, the query name is the IP, backwards, with <code>in-addr.arpa</code> at the front.
It’s backwards because of the hierarchical nature of DNS, which runs right to left, the opposite of IPs.
Of course, there’s also rDNS for IPv6:</p>

<p>One of the core pillars of IPv6 is that most of the processing of traffic should happen at the endpoints — routers don’t do much besides read, and forward, with very little actual data processing.
The IPv6 header while being <em>gargantuan</em> in comparison (because the giant addresses), is also much simpler.
A fixed version code (6), the traffic class (<abbr title="Differentiated Services">DiffServ</abbr>
+ <abbr title="Explicit Congestion Notification">ECN</abbr>
), a <em>flow label</em> which is effectively a random value that’s constant for every packet that’s part of the same logical connection, length, type of next header, and a TTL (then addresses, obviously).
That is <em>it</em>.
The IPv4 header contains 13 fields plus optional sections, and the IPv6 header contains a flat 8.
Of course, you may actually need other details, and that’s where the <em>next header</em> field comes in.
Instead of packing all sorts of options into the standard, global header, IPv6 uses additional header <em>extensions</em> that can get tacked on one after another to provide that information, say for fragmentation or IPsec.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
The value in the next header field identifies what’s going to come next, and the final header in the line will use this field to indicate the contained protocol, be it TCP, UDP, or something else.</p>
<p>Also note there’s no checksum anymore.
I mean, just about every device uses Ethernet, which has a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), UDP has a checksum option, TCP has a required checksum…
If we want to simply packet processing, drop the sum.
And really, it does make sense, in a way.
Even without that one, that means that most programs have two checksums: the Ethernet FCS as the frame gets transmitted point to point, and the transport layer checksum, making sure the entire packet is still valid.
Also, the IPv4 checksum also included the TTL (max number of hops in the path before the packet is dropped), meaning that at <em>every stop</em> along the way, the checksum had to be recalculated.</p>
<p>As a final point, this also does bring a change to another protocol: UDP.
With IPv4, the UDP checksum field can (and often would) be left blank as all zeros, meaning “no checksum”.
In IPv6, this is now disallowed, and a all zero checksum will still be checked… and then found invalid.
All UDP packets over IPv6 <em>must</em> have a valid checksum calculated.</p>

<p>So every link between devices has an MTU, the Maximum Transmission Unit.
For normal Ethernet links, minus the frame overhead, this is 1500 bytes.
If your equipment supports jumbo frames, that’s closer to 9000 bytes.
Well not all links are equal.
Some devices might have a high-MTU link on one end, and a lower MTU link on the other.
For example, my router might support jumbo frames internally, but the WAN side doesn’t allow that.
To deal with, this, we have <em>fragmentation</em>.</p>
<p>If a router is unable to forward a frame due to MTU differences, it will, if allowed, split the packet into multiple chunks, using the More Fragments flag and the Fragment Offset field of the IPv4 header, and send the packet in multiple frames piece by piece, which the other end can reassemble.
Note that I said “if allowed.”
There is a Don’t Fragment flag in the IPv4 header, and if this is set by the sending device, a router that cannot support a packet of that size will send back an <abbr title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</abbr>
“packet too big” message which bounces back along the chain.
Any node in the network path can perform this, meaning that for sending data, the only MTU you care about is the MTU of the device you’re directly connected …</p></div></article></div>

                <h3>Anatomy of a Binary Executable</h3>
                
                    <p><em></em>
                        <span>Wed, Nov 4, 2020</span>

                    </p>
                
            </div>

            <p>Even though I’ve developed software for a number of years now, there’s one question that has always been in the back of my mind and I haven’t had the time or patience to really answer, until now: <strong>What <em>is</em> a binary executable anyways?</strong></p>
<p>For this example, I wrote a brutally simple Rust program that includes a function “<code>sum</code>” to add two integers together, and am invoking it from <code>main()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, sum(<span>5</span>, <span>8</span>));
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span>(a: <span>i32</span>, b: <span>i32</span>) -&gt; <span>i32</span> {
    a <span>+</span> b
}
</code></pre></div><p>My Rust code is always structured the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html">“cargo way”</a>, so I can compile my program by running <code>cargo build</code>, and this will produce a binary for me within the <code>target/debug/</code> directory. I have named my crate <code>rbin</code>, so this is the name of the binary that is created at this location:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ cargo build
   Compiling rbin v0.1.0 <span>(</span>/home/mierdin/Code/rbin<span>)</span>
    Finished dev <span>[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span>]</span> target<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in 0.15s

~$ ls -lha target/debug/rbin
-rwxrwxr-x <span>2</span> mierdin mierdin 3.1M Nov  <span>3</span> 22:46 target/debug/rbin
</code></pre></div><p>These days, it’s really easy to take such questions for granted, but if you’re curious, you may be asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But what <strong>is</strong> that file?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean we all generally know that it’s an “executable”, in that we run it and our program happens. But what does that mean? What is contained in that file that means our computer automatically just <strong>knows</strong> how to run it? And how is it possible that a program with 7 lines of code can take up over 3 megabytes of disk space?!?</p>
<p>It turns out that in order to create an executable for this ridiculously simple program, the Rust compiler must include quite a bit of additional software to make it possible.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out there is a widely accepted format for these things, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">“Executable and Linkable Format”</a>, or ELF!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that I won’t be comprehensively covering ELF here (there are plenty of other resources, many of which I’ll link to) - rather this is an exploration of what goes into a Rust binary with the simplest, default settings, and some observations about what seems interesting to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ELF is a well-known, popular format, especially in the world of Linux, but there are plenty of others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_executable_file_formats">Operating systems like Windows and macOS each have their own format</a>, which is a big reason why, when you’re compiling (or simply downloading) software, you have to specify the operating system you want to run it on. This is true despite the fact that the underlying machine code that executes your program may be the same on all of them (e.g. <code>x86_64</code>).</p>
<p>An <strong>exceptional</strong> visual breaking down the ELF format can be found at the link to the ELF wikipedia page above, I have found myself constantly referring back to it while writing this post:</p>
<p><a title="Ange Albertini / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0)" href="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"><img width="512" alt="ELF Executable and Linkable Format diagram by Ange Albertini" src="https://oswalt.dev/assets/2020/11/elf.png"></a>
</p>
<p>Commonly, executable formats like this specify a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number">magic number</a> right at the beginning of the file, so that the format can be easily identified. This occupies the first four bytes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>. This is a very important field, because unless we can first identify an ELF file appropriately, we can’t reasonably expect to do anything “ELF-y” with it. We know where certain bits of information <strong>should</strong> be in an ELF file, but we first must identify using these bytes that this is what we can expect.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility is extremely useful for printing all kinds of useful metadata and related tables of information contained within an ELF file. However, this utility expects - naturally - that the file being read is actually an ELF file, and even provides a helpful hint that the expected “magic bytes” for a non-ELF file aren’t set appropriately when used on a non-ELF file, so it doesn’t attempt to read the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l .gitignore

readelf: Error: Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start
</code></pre></div><p>Once identified, the entire rest of the file can be identified using <strong>byte offsets</strong> (that is, the number of bytes from zero).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those that are accustomed to looking at network packet captures, this should all sound very familiar to you, as this is exactly how we know where certain fields are located in a packet header. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frames</a> have a predictable preamble and start-of-frame delimiter. Ethernet also has a field called the “Ethertype”, which provides a clue as to what protocol is contained within the Ethernet frame (which allows computers to then parse those field as well). Just like Ethernet has a standard set of byte offsets that indicate where the various fields should be represented, the ELF format specifies its own offsets for all of the fields providing useful identifying and execution information in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header">file header</a>, which then point to other important locations within the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s all kinds of useful information in this header, but in particular, the <code>e_entry</code> field  in the file header points to the offset location from where the execution should start. This is the “entry point” for the program. We’ll definitely be following this down the rabbit hole in a little bit.</p>
<p>We can again use <code>readelf</code>, this time on a proper ELF file (our Rust program), and also using the <code>-h</code> flag to show the file header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -h target/debug/rbin

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f <span>45</span> 4c <span>46</span> <span>02</span> <span>01</span> <span>01</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span> <span>00</span>

  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       <span>0</span>
  Type:                              DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
  Machine:                           Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x5070
  Start of program headers:          <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Start of section headers:          <span>3195368</span> <span>(</span>bytes into file<span>)</span>
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Size of program headers:           <span>56</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of program headers:         <span>12</span>
  Size of section headers:           <span>64</span> <span>(</span>bytes<span>)</span>
  Number of section headers:         <span>42</span>
  Section header string table index: <span>41</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, the “magic number” lets us parse at least the rest of the file header, which contains not only information about the file, but byte-offset locations for other important portions of the file. One of these is the “Start of program headers”, which starts after 64 bytes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header">program header table</a> contains information that allows the operating system to allocate memory and load the program. This is also referred to as a <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/psimage.html">process image</a>. You can think of it as a list of “instructions” that tell the system to do various things with chunks of memory in order to prepare to execute this program.</p>
<p>The <code>readelf</code> utility also allows us to read the program headers using the <code>-l</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">~$ readelf -l target/debug/rbin

Elf file type is DYN <span>(</span>Shared object file<span>)</span>
Entry point 0x5070
There are <span>12</span> program headers, starting at offset <span>64</span>
