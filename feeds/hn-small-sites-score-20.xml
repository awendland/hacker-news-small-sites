    <div>
      <p><a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html">Linux is not a secure operating system</a>. However, there are steps you can take to improve it. This guide aims to explain
      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>
      
      DISCLAIMER: Do not attempt to apply anything in this article if you do not know exactly what you are doing. This guide is focused purely on security and privacy,
      not performance, usability, or anything else. </p><p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This protects against <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337">time-wait assassination</a>…</p></div>

<p>It all started at my first job. I’ve been around 6 months in the company and was happy getting used to the ropes of my current job. In those 6 months, I quickly pushed to prod (without even knowing it) and was learning very fast. I still remember when my boss called me to his office: We are going to do some changes and you’ll lead this new 3 person team. I thought to myself: Cool, I’ve learned some books about leadership, this could be fun.</p>



<p>The tricky part was the members of the team. They were a couple of technicians who had more than ten years on the job and more than twenty years in the company ( I was twenty years old). One of them was even a team lead recently. I did not understand the mechanics of that re-org at the time and still don’t have all the information about what was happening. I wish I had some cool story about why I was chosen to lead the team, really don’t know.</p>



<p>It was not a walk in the park, things started to get ugly before they could get better. As expected they pushed back a lot, they did not like the change, me, or anything that was happening. It’s funny, looking back I think my ego should have been hurt based on all the times they tried to avoid working with me and change things. I guess I was so confused with everything that I had no time for that.</p>



<p>When we started to work together, one thing was clear: they were not in the mood to take orders from a kid. I was not in the mood to give orders to them. This particular situation helped me a lot and shaped the way I work ten years later.</p>



<p>Given that it was almost impossible to give orders and avoid starting a world war. I started listening, that’s what I did the most in the first weeks. I listened and asked questions. Not like interrogations, more like curious questions. I think the key to the questions what that I wanted to learn from them. I was not a trick, I was very interested in what they were doing.</p>



<p>I still remember some kind of pranks they pulled on me. They would tell me they had run out of a particular material they needed. I had made a lot of calls and research to try to find it for them, then they magically found some in the warehouse or the car they used. I did not know these were pranks, I learned later when they had another team lead (I laughed that time).</p>



<p>With some retrospective, I think these pranks were not just to pick on the new guy. I think they were testing me. They wanted to see what I did, would I forget about the problem, slack off, blame it on them, or take ownership and be part of the team. Most of the time I came with solutions and discussed alternatives with the team. Some weeks later I think they started to trust me.</p>



<p>There was a point where I started to notice that I could help with some things. Not so much in executing, but there were some things they needed help with. Mostly operational excellence. They were relieved to have someone handle that. Every week we were becoming a better team.</p>



<p>Patience was a foundation for this team. At least from my side. I did not rush things out (I was not even sure how to do that) and never try to impose my ideas or way of working. I trusted a lot the team and things started to look better.</p>



<p>Not everything was perfect. We had disagreements and sometimes we preferred different approaches. This is normal in all teams, the good part is that we started to have a process. We had a daily meeting, talked about what we needed to do that day and we talked briefly at the end of the day. Every side learned to cede sometimes and when months have passed we were playing by ear.</p>



<p>Even though we were a productive team and technically very respected, what I always treasure from these experiences is human relationships. I still have a great time whenever I talk to these two people and we have a blast remembering the good old days. Based on what they say, they learn a thing or two from me, but I learned a ton from them and that experience.</p>

<p>They are more accurate than complicated devices in the laboratory, they know “something is wrong” faster and cannot be fooled.  In Poznań, mussels have been keeping water purity for 26 years.  The TVN24 reporter checked what exactly their “work” is all about and whether the inconspicuous barks have raised the alarm. </p>
<p><span>In Poznań, 26 years ago, mussels were “employed” to check the safety of water, and more specifically large ones.  The capital of Greater Poland was the first Polish city to decide on such a solution. </span></p>
<p><span>– Working as a microbiologist, I always thought to introduce a system that would work independently and would be based on living organisms.  The idea was for such a system to give us information about the quality of the water.  When looking at chemical tests, you can check a lot of things, but for each type of test you need a separate device – says Grzegorz Podolski, senior technologist for water quality at Aquanet. </span></p>

</p><p><span>It is different with biomonitoring.  – Here one organism, in this case a clam, checks many parameters and if there is any chemical contamination, it lets you know.  And that’s enough to take a sample, take it to the laboratory and see what it is about: confirm or deny that something is happening to the water.  It is a system that ensures safety against pollution and even terrorist activities.  The work of the mussels is closely related to what the laboratory does, adds Podolski. </span></p>
</div>
<h2>Work for two months </h2>

<p><span>Clams nourish themselves by filtering the water.  They are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution and much more than humans.  That is why they belong to the indicators, i.e. species of plants and animals that have a low degree of tolerance to changes in conditions in the environment in which they live. </span></p>
<p><span>How many mussels were given a “job” and how long they can work was checked and described in the instruction by scientists from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.  – We have three measuring devices in the company and eight clams in each.  In total, we “employ” 200 individuals during the year – says Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Within an hour, one individual can filter 1.5 liters of water.  – It is a good cooperation.  We have full democracy and gender equality here, because we have both male and female individuals – says Dorota Wiśniewska, spokesman for Aquanet SA in Poznań. </span></p>
<p><span>Each clam is first prepared and fed.  Then it goes to a special flow-through aquarium.  And there, for two months, they are on “duty”.  – This is the time when he can work and live safely.  Then the “workers” return to their natural environment, that is, to water reservoirs – explains Wiśniewska. </span></p>

<h2>They filter and alarm </h2>

<p><span>Biomonitoring based on mussels consists in constant, round-the-clock observation and registration of their shell movements.  How it’s working? </span></p>
<p><span>– Mussels open the shells and every now and then take in a small amount of water, filtering out everything that is suitable for eating.  When the water is polluted, they do their best to separate from it, and everyone’s shells just close at the same time.  This happens within two minutes.  If two or three clams close, it doesn’t have to mean anything, but if there are eight, it’s an alarm.  Then our role is to find out what has upset them so much and find out if it is a real or a false alarm – says Podolski. </span></p>

<p><span>– Have they all shut down?  – the TVN24 reporter asks. </span></p>
<p><span>– There has not been such a situation for these 26 years.  The water that goes to the mussels is of very good quality – adds Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Scientists have translated these clam responses into ‘computer language’.  – The mussels are glued to the plastic pedestal.  In addition, a magnet disc is glued to the shell, and a probe is mounted nearby that detects changes in the magnetic field.  When the clam closes or opens, it touches the probe with this magnet.  And we translate it into an image of the degree of opening and closing – explains the Aquanet employee.  </span></p>

<p><span>– During these 26 years, when we talk about the work of mussels during “open doors” or educational lessons, they always arouse positive emotions and great interest.  Visitors are always surprised that such small creatures play such an important role – adds Wiśniewska. </span></p>

So, I wanted to attempt to derive a learning progression for developers.</p><p>At each level of development, I recommend a few books. Each book hopefully is a thread you can pull on, if you want to go deeper into a particular topic.The book recommendations are subjective, but I believe that one can chart their own curriculum following the basic model. The recommendations that I make are just based on my own experience and aim to serve merely as guidance.</p><p><strong>Completely Clockwork</strong></p><p>My recommendations for this level would be:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rDymed">Refactoring</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2L4q3HJ">Clean Architecture</a></p></li></ul><p>At this level most of the work is involved in making changes in a single service or component. This is where most of the <em>‘coding’</em> happens. The amount of time that will be spent reading your code will be multiples of the amount you would take to write it. You will work more with existing code rather than writing new code. A corollary of this fact is that you need to know how to make your code easy to change.So your focus should be on writing readable code and making it easy to change. With these considerations in mind, I recommend the following books&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somewhat Clockwork</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rFMkfH">Designing Data Intensive Applications&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o1QDjf">Building Microservices</a></p></li></ul><p>Distributed systems are ubiquitous. Even when you are making a change to a single service, that service most likely lives in an ecosystem of other services and a plethora of other distributed tools. As you grow in seniority you need to understand how best to interact with other services in your vicinity and also the tradeoffs involved with each tool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Somewhat Complex</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eAl7">Domain Driven Design</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o2KenM">Team Topologies</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3mYTWpZ">SRE Book&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eWrX">Accelerate&nbsp;</a></p></li></ul><p>We are now in the scope of system of systems. A practitioner operating mostly at this level needs to be able to use models to explain the system and its interactions. These models are not just to explain the software system but also the teams that surround that software. You need to understand the best models for organizing teams to drive maximum impact. Additionally, as the operator of <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">complex systems</a> they wear two hats : that of the producer and that of the protector against failure. The practitioner needs to be able to handle this duality well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Completely Complex</strong></p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">Wardley Maps</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/38Msirg">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></p></li></ul><p>According to the paper, a completely complex system is a dynamic process, which is constantly in a state of flux. Any patterns here are emergent. Changes have both short term and long term repercussions. You also realize that the system is self organized for the most part. This sounds a lot like the modern organization. At this scope you are typically operating as the technical leadership. You need to be able to form technical strategies grounded in the needs of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>So to summarize, this is what we end up with as a progression plan for developers over varying degrees of complexity.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28bc0788-6e0d-4a91-ba8c-59684f53ff47_1600x486.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve been in a reflective mood lately, probably because it’s the end of a very eventful year. Change is all around us and technology is the enabler.</p>



<p>On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own experiences with technology-driven change in the reinsurance industry, where I worked as an analyst from 2017 until recently.</p>



<p>During these three short years, I observed a radical shift in data analysis methodologies. Excel-based models, which had seemed top-of-the-line suddenly were too slow and too rigid; Integration with 3rd party data sources, which was once a luxury, became the norm; And analysts began to utilize scripts to accomplish many labor-intensive tasks typically performed by hand or in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Enabling this change is a suite of accessible Python-powered tools. These technologies are rapidly displacing the old way of doing things, ushering in a new wave of reinsurance models and the talent needed to support them.</p>



<p>Admittedly, the following observations do come from a very niche industry. But I believe that the broader trends discussed here will also apply to other legacy companies and sectors.</p>



<p>In this post, I explore the following topics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> – An introduction to reinsurance</li><li><strong>Section 2 – </strong>The need for technological disruption in the reinsurance industry</li><li><strong>Sections 3 to 5</strong> – How Python is replacing Excel</li><li><strong>Section 6 </strong>– Arguments against adopting new technologies</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> – The evolution of the reinsurance industry</li></ul>



<p>If you are curious about the transition from Excel to Python but aren’t interested in reinsurance, skip to section 3.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="406" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>1. Reinsurance, from an analyst’s perspective</h2>



<p>Most people understand insurance, but few have heard of its rather exotic sounding cousin: reinsurance. So, before I begin, here’s a quick intro:</p>



<p>Just as individuals transfer risk to insurers in exchange for a premium, insurers too must mitigate their risk by transferring some or all of their liabilities to one or more reinsurance companies. This enables insurers to protect themselves in the case of a large event, such as a hurricane, which affects many individual policyholders. Without reinsurers, insurance companies would not be able to survive catastrophes and would be much more risk averse, ultimately impacting the end consumer.</p>



<p>Reinsurance programs come in a variety of flavors to suit the need of the reinsured. I’ll spare you the details but suffice it to say that all potential reinsurance programs must first be analyzed. In industry speak, this is the process of “pricing a deal”.</p>



<p>For each deal, brokers gather relevant data from the insurance companies and send it to potential reinsurers as a “submission”. It is the underwriting analyst’s responsibility to parse this data, enter it into Excel-based models and produce a number.</p>



<p>This number, the loss ratio, represents the expected loss divided by the total premium and typically ranges between 10% to 150+%. LRs above 100% mean that the premium is not sufficient to cover the losses that we expect based on our model. In other words, we’d be writing the deal at a loss.</p>



<p>In reality, reinsurance companies have pricing hurdles well below 100% because they have other money outflows to account for such as brokerage (intermediary fees) and G&amp;A (general and administrative expenses).</p>



<p>The point is, Excel is the key piece of software that enables underwriting teams to assess new business. Throughout the company, different teams use different models, each with different processes and different pricing hurdles. But the one common theme is that all of the models are based on Excel spreadsheets. That’s just how the industry works. Everyone uses Excel for everything.</p>



<p>Well, until recently.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>2. Change is coming</h2>



<p>In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including:</p>



<ol><li>The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets</li><li>The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models</li><li>The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices</li></ol>



<p>Excel fails miserably at these tasks.</p>



<p>First, expressing complex reinsurance deals requires tabs and tabs of structural details, interlinking formulas and limiting assumptions. It’s a mess to build and a headache to understand. Have a lot of data? That’s more tabs and formulas to add to the model. Performance slows dramatically and minutes of your life are wasted waiting for bloated spreadsheets to finally open.</p>



<p>Second, you’re forced to use the VBA programming language if you want to query external data or implement user-defined functionality. According to one Stack Overflow survey, VBA ranked “most dreaded” of all the languages, which wholly sums up my feelings. The development environment is not user friendly, the syntax confusing, there’s no support for unit testing –&nbsp;I could go on.</p>



<p>Third, Excel is fragile. Views and logic are intermingled, making it very hard to troubleshoot errors. Also, models aren’t put into source control, so you can’t restore an old version. Massive spreadsheets with dozens of tabs frequently crash without warning, much to the dismay of underwriting analysts (like myself).</p>



<p>During my three years in reinsurance, I witnessed a dire need for new tooling. And, from what I observed, it is clear that this tooling will be powered by Python.</p>







<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>3. The future is Python</h2>



<p>As a technical underwriting analyst with programming skills, I was among the first to build and benefit from what I think are the next generation of pricing tools. These tools fall into two main categories:</p>



<ul><li>Excel models running Python code</li><li>Python notebooks in the browser</li></ul>



<p>Both options offer enhanced analysis capabilities while still catering to a non-technical or semi-technical end user.</p>



<p>Now, let’s explore each technology in more detail.</p>



<h2>4. Excel models running Python code</h2>



<p>The first category of new technology is based on augmentation. Rather than adding VBA code to your Excel spreadsheet, you can use Python instead. This is possible thanks to 3rd party Excel add-ins such <a href="https://www.pyxll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyXLL</a>, which brings the power of Python data analysis into the humble spreadsheet.</p>



<p>When you open Excel, the add-in makes your Python code accessible either as functions or as macros. This means that you can write Python code in the development environment of your choice, add unit tests, integrate with 3rd party libraries and push to source control.</p>



<p>PyXLL facilitated a step change in how we construct reinsurance models. Specifically, here’s how our setup looked before and after augmenting our model with Python:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Python</strong></td><td><strong>After Python</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We used an Excel spreadsheet-based model with dozens of tabs containing complex formulas, endless pivot tables and unintelligible VBA code.</td><td>The tangled mess of VBA was re-written into independent Python modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</td></tr><tr><td>The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open.</td><td>The Excel spreadsheet is now just a view, so it is lightweight and quick to open.</td></tr><tr><td>There was no visibility into errors. “Debugging” meant manually breaking apart lengthy Excel formulas.</td><td>The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently.</td></tr><tr><td>We were limited by the assumptions made when the model was first created, with little ability to add new features.</td><td>The codebase lives in source control, enabling multiple collaborators to work in tandem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developers can use their preferred development environment.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A robust peer review process helps to perpetuate high quality code.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Using PyXLL, we built an underwriting pricing model powered entirely by Python code. We were able to express structural complexities of deals at a level never before achieved. And we were able to add simulation-based pricing techniques that simply cannot be done using spreadsheets alone.</p>



<p>The impact of PyXLL on how we build models and ultimately price business cannot be understated.</p>



<p>Which leads us to the second technology that is changing the way we perform underwriting data analysis…</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-3.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>5. Python notebooks in the browser</h2>



<p>The second novel approach to reinsurance risk assessment and pricing is enabled via Python notebooks. These are web-based documents that can contain narrative text, live code, charts and visuals, plus results from your data analysis. </p>



<p>Python notebooks are all about collaboration, visualization and rapid iteration. They are a way to execute code with minimal setup and overhead, making it easier for new programmers to explore data outside of Excel. One of my favorite parts of notebooks is how easy it is to access your data, whether that’s from a file, SQL databases or an external source.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what a data analysis project looked like for me with and without Python notebooks:</p>

But I’m really excited, because I just got the Tetris title screen working!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9JwbvM5phtNcpgBj_2Un5C3QWVLTn24SWN43trTYG7ryH4enLNU6vbMzqMYwridlrhT8HswNBQNVUk19vTe87fsSwvJf0W-IsUEx6j8u13I1zKrktnzabBUzOf3lZcNor0lvGxV" title=""></span></p><p><span>This is the first time I’ve worked on an emulator and </span><span>oh boy</span><span>&nbsp;do I regret taking this long to get around to it. This has been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Not only do I feel like I’m truly gaining a more fundamental understanding of the internals of a machine (which is sort of the point), but it is SO exciting suddenly seeing someone else’s software pop up on the screen.</span></p><p><span>I’m still working on this journey myself but I thought I’d share what I’ve done so far to hopefully encourage others to give this a go.</span></p><p><span>It all started with the bootrom. The gameboy didn’t have an operating system. It simply had a simple bootrom that showed you that famous Nintendo logo (which is actually </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA">a novel DRM scheme</a></span><span>). It’s a very simple program that you can read line by line making it pretty easy to work out where I was going wrong. I started by making a “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></span><span>” which was just a big ol switch statement going through </span><span><a href="https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/">each opcode</a></span><span>. This is definitely the most labour intensive part of the project. There are a lot of opcodes.</span></p><p><span>What you quickly discover while implementing opcodes is that the gameboy memory is basically just an array. So next I created registers and an “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a></span><span>” (the gameboy didn’t really have an MMU but this made things easier to manage). After around four days, I had the Nintendo logo rendering!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xRho4Dq1Fo1vUdM6BNTShSDwfBupG_CSlcrlkG2m9MhC_O75h1T1krLYA16RbOXUSH0BO-W_6u-2B6opnDkgzO3BYHmHJLxgrWbaPEJfbhumMPHAZp0acPT2iL_86tIv3zCLl6DB" title=""></span></p><p><span>Simple rendering is pretty straightforward. The Gameboy would write to a certain region of memory reserved for video so all you need to do is read from there to know what you should render. Once I got that far - I was completely hooked. My approach of just implementing more and more Gameboy hardware was working.</span></p><p><span>There are already a ton of resources that go into far more detail:</span></p><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html">http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU">http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/">https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/</a></span></li></ul><p><span>If you have the time and you’re interested, I would strongly suggest you give this project a go.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p><em>This is the fourth installment of my “year in review” series. 
For a recap, here’s <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-years/">2018</a> 
and <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/the-year-everything-changed/">2017</a>.</em></p>

<p>2020 was my fourth year of building my own internet businesses.
Like everyone else, my 2020 did <em>not</em> go according to plan.
And yet, things worked out in the end.</p>

<p>It was a year of big swings: starting with a taste of celebrity—followed by 
the collapse of my biggest business—and closing with record-breaking success.
Eventually I ended up almost exactly where I planned,
only the route was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of my 2020 in nine pictures.</p>

<h4 id="january-officially-an-indie-hacker">January: officially an Indie Hacker!</h4>

<p>In January, I met and recorded a podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>,
founder of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and a hero of mine. 
When <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/147-cory-zue-of-place-card-me">the podcast aired</a>,
I had a tiny taste of celebrity, hearing from people throughout the Twitter-verse
who were inspired by my story.
It was the most fun moment of my Indie Hacking career.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/first-subscription/me-and-courtland.jpg" alt="Meeting Courtland Allen"></p>

<p>Me and Courtland Allen in his Cape Town Airbnb. January, 2020.</p>

<p>Courtland also convinced me to double down on my <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">wedding place card app</a>—called Place Card Me—leading
to <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/first-subscription/">my first ever subscription revenue online</a>.</p>

<p>The year was looking good!</p>

<h4 id="march-the-pandemic-shakes-things-up">March: the pandemic shakes things up</h4>

<p>Fast forward to mid-March, and the world decided to take Covid-19 very seriously, very fast.</p>

<p>Place Card Me—my primary side-business—saw its revenue plummet to $0 almost overnight.
Not seeing a way to pivot, I decided to pause work on the project indefinitely—now
9 months and counting—and shift my focus to <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Pegasus, my Django boilerplate for SaaS apps</a>.
Sorry, Courtland!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/place-card-me-5-weeks-corona.png" alt="Place Card Me Revenue Feb-March"></p>

<p>Place Card Me’s revenue, late Feb - April 1. It has sinced picked up a bit, but remains
well off 2019’s numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Africa—where I live—introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world,
including banning alcohol sales and disallowing outdoor exercise.
I had to resort to running in circles around my flat.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/lockdown-run.png" alt="Lockdown Run"></p>

<p>My lockdown running route. Hundreds of circles around my small flat. March, 2020.</p>

<p>The lockdown also took away our childcare, so my wife and I split the work day in half.
My productive hours ended at noon, most of my time went to my day job,
and my side-businesses languished.</p>

<h4 id="may-my-first-record-breaking-month-of-the-year">May: my first record-breaking month of the year</h4>

<p>In May we got childcare back and for the first time in months I had time for proactive work.</p>

<p>I started by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/may-2020/">experimenting with some pricing changes</a> 
leading to Pegasus earning over $4,000—more than any of my products had ever earned in a single month.
I had to re-do the axes on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open">side-project dashboard</a>—where I track
my product revenue and effort—to accommodate the new high.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/pegasus-y-axis.png" alt="Pegasus Breaking the Chart"></p>

<p>Pegasus income breaks the chart on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side project dashboard</a>. May, 2020.</p>

<h4 id="july-august-distractions-and-failure">July-August: distractions and failure</h4>

<p>July and August saw my biggest divergence of the year.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be a good opportunity to exercise Pegasus, I decided to build and launch
a new product to provide <a href="https://repostory.app/">code review analytics for Github repositories</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before I finished MVP I realized the project was too ambitious for the 
amount of time I was willing to devote to it.
So, following a lackluster launch, and seeing a long road ahead, 
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/aug-2020/">I decided to stop working on it indefinitely</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/repostory-social.png" alt="RepoStory"></p>

<p>RepoStory: my failed experiment building code review analytics product, launched to no one in August.</p>

<p>I still think the project has potential, but for now it’s lying idle.</p>

<h4 id="september-hello-world">September: hello world!</h4>

<p>September marked the arrival of our new son Victor into the world.
I learned that <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/new-parent-again/">being a parent is easier the second time around</a>—except
for the <em>other</em> kid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/new-parent-again/victor-sleep.jpg" alt="Hello Victor"></p>

<p>Our new son Victor, born September 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on paternity leave I stumbled upon a diagram labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">Ikigai</a>—that 
I later learned was <em>not</em> Ikigai—that made me question about my chosen career.</p>

<p>Specifically, I felt like I was doing well with everything <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/ikigai/">except possibly “what the world needs”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/not-ikigai.jpg" alt="Not Ikigai"></p>

<p>This diagram, often attributed as the Japanese concept of Ikigai, was actually
created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmograma">Andrés Zuzunaga</a>.</p>

<p>So, I devoted a chunk of the last three months of the year to trying to explore the topic of a “meaningful” life
and career more seriously.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/how-to-save-the-world/">turns out this is hard</a>!</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I figure it out.</p>

<h4 id="november-another-record-breaking-month">November: another record-breaking month</h4>

<p>Back on the business-side of things, at the end of November, I ran an impulse Black Friday sale,
leading to another record-breaking month for Pegasus and 
me—outstripping my previous monthly high by almost $3,000.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/total-profits-social.png" alt="Black Friday"></p>

<p>The massive spike from the Pegasus Black Friday sale. November, 2020.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">my write-up on the sale</a> made 
the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, resulting in about 10,000
visitors to my website and leading to another few Pegasus sales.</p>

<p>After the whole saga, I was suddenly within reach of my 2020 profit target of $42k that
I’d all-but abandoned post-Covid.</p>

<h4 id="december-rr">December: R&amp;R</h4>

<p>Finally, rounding out the year amidst another Covid surge and lockdown in South Africa
with the family and some time off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/family-holidays.jpg" alt="Family Holidays"></p>

<p>While alcohol sales are again closed in South Africa, at least the national parks are open. December, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="profits">Profits</h2>

<p>When all was said and done, <strong>total profits on the year from personal projects came in just over $43,000</strong>—or
about $1k higher than <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">my goal set in January</a>.
Given how hard the pandemic hit Place Card Me, I’m quite proud to have still hit that target.</p>

<p>Here’s the last four years of product income—broken out by product.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/profits-by-year.png" alt="Profits by year"></p>

<p>Annual profits by product. Now available on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side-project dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Place Card Me ended up down about 42% on the year, but Pegasus more than made up for it,
growing from $4,000 to almost $30,000 in a single year—or about <em>double</em> 
what I had forecasted at the start of the year.</p>

<p>More on this later.</p>

<h2 id="time-spend">Time spend</h2>

<p>I logged just under 2,000 hours this year. 
This works out almost exactly to a standard 40-hour-a-week, 52-week work-year,
which makes it easier to think about the time distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/2020-time.png" alt="2020 time"></p>

<p>In terms of a calendar year breakdown, about four months went to my day job at Dimagi,
three months went to Pegasus, six weeks went to email and writing,
another five weeks went to exercise(!), and then the rest fell into smaller buckets.</p>

<p>I’m happy with this breakdown, though I would prefer if the amount of “day job” time was a bit
less and the amount of “exploration” time was a bit more.
Something to think about for 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>If 2020 was the year of Pegasus then 2021 will be the year of…well…also Pegasus.</p>

<p>Yep, for the third year running, <strong>I’m planning for Pegasus to be my main hustle</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><em>Because it still feels like Pegasus is in its first act</em>.</p>

<p>A year into Place Card Me the product felt basically complete.
I could add features, improve marketing, etc. but there weren’t any easy ways to grow it without 
fundamentally changing the product in some way.
Place Card Me made place cards well. Where do you go from there?</p>

<p>Pegasus on the other hand, seems to have limitless possibility.
The core product itself can continue getting better, with lots of features to add and improvements to 
make—some of which are already in flight. Plus, it’s fun as hell.</p>

<p>But even Pegasus itself is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Could Pegasus have a plug-in marketplace where other developers can earn money extending it?
Could Pegasus have a jobs board to connect Django developers to my customers who need help on their projects?
Could Pegasus offer Django courses or books?
Or a hosted way to deploy your Django apps to the cloud?</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/183-chris-oliver-of-gorails">Chris Oliver has done for Ruby on Rails</a>, 
there appear to be an infinite amount of Pegasus-adjacent opportunities to create new products, offerings,
and build out the Pegasus ecosystem—all of which are aligned with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah. Already my most profitable product by a lot and still in act one.
Hopefully exciting times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="2021-targets">2021 Targets</h2>

<p>The other big decision I’ve made about 2021 is that it’s time to flip the narrative 
of what I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>For the last four years I’ve thought of myself as a professional developer/freelancer who also played around
on the internet trying to make money from side-hustles.</p>

<p>But barring an unexpected turn of events—<em>I expect 2021 to be the first year I make
the majority of my income from my own businesses</em>.
A change I hope just might hold for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>the side hustles have become the main hustle.</em>
<strong>I’m no longer a <em>side-project</em> entrepreneur. I’m a mother-fucking <em>real entrepreneur</em>.</strong></p>

<p>So, here are my targets for 2020:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Earn $65k Profit from personal projects.</li>
  <li>Spend the majority of my time working for myself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to own this thing!
I’m looking forward to it.</p>

Therefore, the only sensible bet is to believe in God. This has come to be known as <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-pascals-wager-is-eminently-modern" target="_blank">Pascal’s wager</a>.</p><p>It has a surprising number of applications beyond concerns for a comfortable afterlife. There are many things for which the value of believing something or not can be seen as a cost-versus-likely-benefit wager,&nbsp;often without regard to the actual truth of the matter. Since science does not profess to have a final truth, and in many areas freely admits its incomplete knowledge, Pascal’s wager can provide a useful method of deciding between two alternatives.</p><blockquote><p>All drugs and treatments have side effects, but vaccines in general have the fewest.</p> </blockquote><p>For example, it seems that a significant percentage of the population is suspicious of science, or so we are told. We often hear that some large number, approaching or exceeding half of Americans, do not believe in evolution. This seems remarkable on the face of it because there is no viable scientific opposition to evolution and it is widely accepted by biologists and other life scientists as being fundamental to understanding biology—from genetics to medicine.<br></p><p>What we are not often told is that most of those who answer negatively about believing in evolution nonetheless understand evolution—or at least the basics of it. They are not stupid, ignorant, or uninformed. They have simply made a Pascalian wager. What benefit, we might ask, is derived from believing in evolution rather than a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/how-to-weed-creationism-out-of-schools" target="_blank">divine creation</a>? Unless you are a professional biologist, it is hard to see how this would affect your everyday life. On the other hand, professing a belief in Darwinian evolution over the biblical narrative will likely ostracize you from family, friends, co-workers, your church community—in short most of your social infrastructure. Place your bets.</p><p>Can we apply any of this to decisions over the current controversy surrounding vaccination—and in particular the newly arrived COVID-19 vaccine?</p><p>There are certainly reasons to be concerned about being vaccinated, and it would be a gross over-simplification to consider anyone who expresses reticence about taking a vaccine, this new vaccine in particular, as being just plain dumb or scientifically illiterate or gullible. They need be none of these things and still may be suspicious of the vaccine.<br></p><p>One issue is safety. The vaccine, any vaccine, is designed to mobilize your immune system, essentially to fool it into believing that there is an invading virus present and to mount an immune response. That way it will be ready when the real invasion comes, if it comes. This seems pretty sensible and preferable to going to war with an opponent you know nothing about. But still, it is fooling around with Mother Nature and some people are uneasy about that. Although it must be pointed out that the virus is not at all shy about fooling around with your immune system and many other parts of you, so letting it have its way is not good policy, either.</p><p>What about a vaccine made of genes? This vaccine is being produced by what is being touted as a new method using RNA—genes. While it is true that for entirely economic reasons, this is the first vaccine to be produced in this way, the method is not really new and the science that makes it possible has been developing over the last 40 years. So it’s not so radical as the press makes it seem.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is true that this method uses RNA, genetic material, to make the vaccine. We hear a lot about gene modification and the potential dangers associated with it. Why then am I going to allow RNA, genes, to be injected into me? The first thing to realize is that this is exactly what the virus does—so whether you get a vaccine or an infection, you are getting genes injected into you. The virus RNA encodes around 12 functional genes (by comparison humans and other mammals have around 25,000 genes). The virus only contains the genes to make a new virus—it does not have any of the capabilities of a normal cell to actually turn those genes into the proteins that make up the complete virus. It hijacks your cells to do this—and that’s how it sickens you, by forcing your cells to make new viruses instead of what they should be doing.</p><blockquote><p>Vaccines have fewer side effects than virtually any other drug you wouldn’t even think twice about taking.</p> </blockquote><p>Now the new vaccines have taken just one of those genes—the one that directs the production of the now infamous spike protein that appears on the surface of a normal virus—and injects just that one gene into your muscle cells, which then make that one single protein. Your immune system comes along and sees that weird protein and makes antibodies to it. These same antibodies will now recognize the spike protein on the surface of any viral particles that invade your body. We have effectively turned the virus into its own enemy.</p><p>The viral RNA that you are getting will decompose over a few days because RNA is not a stable molecule (that, by the way, is why the vaccine needs to be kept frozen) and it will no longer exist in your body. It could only become a permanent part of your genome if it were a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule—and even the chances of that happening would be chemically remote. So regardless of how it sounds, this may actually be the safest sort of vaccine to use. In the future it is likely that all vaccines will be made this way.</p><p><span>T</span>hen, of course, there is the issue of who is running this whole vaccine program—the government and the pharmaceutical industry. These are the guys who brought you opioid addiction, death by Vioxx, soaring drug prices, the worst health-care system in the developed world, regulations where you don’t need them and none where you do—am I really going to trust this cast of so-called “inept villains,” as some believe, to dictate my personal health choices? Do we know for sure that the claims of efficacy are real or just made up to sell some worthless procedure? It would not be the first time. (I would not, on the other hand, worry about Bill Gates having a chip inserted into you along with the vaccine—if you use any social media, navigational tools, or purchase anything online, then Bill Gates already knows more about you than he will get from any injectable chip. So that train has left the station.)</p><p>All this and a few lesser issues are worth a pause, for sure. But we must also look on the positive side of the ledger. Why trust science? Modern medicine and the science behind it has eliminated or dramatically lessened such scourges as smallpox, polio, cholera, chicken pox, measles, rabies, and dozens of other killer pathogens that had previously wiped out enormous numbers of people, in some cases significant parts of entire generations. Don’t we depend on science for much of the comfort and safety of our everyday lives? Isn’t science the way we heat our homes, drive to work, fly around the world, have dependable food? Yes, there is the bomb—but there is also anesthesia.<br></p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>When it comes to viruses, the only tool we have to fight them is vaccination. The only tool. Antibiotics are for bacteria, a completely different sort of creature. Sanitation beyond personal hand-washing is ineffective. Vaccines trick the immune system into recognizing the virus earlier than it would otherwise and protect normal cells from invasion by the virus. Tricking the immune system is understandably problematic for people who believe that their body knows best if it’s just kept healthy. This virus, as we have seen from the array of infected people that includes apparently healthy folks, unfortunately does not subscribe to that belief.</p><p>By a similar sort of reasoning, some people make the plausible error of calculating that the vaccine is 95 percent effective but the survival rate is 99 percent, so why not just let my natural resistance take care of this? Indeed, that might not be unreasonable thinking if we were talking about the common cold, but this virus has shown itself to be a tricky character, and we are not yet able to predict who gets a serious case and who a mild one. With those sorts of stakes, you shouldn’t wager on either of those numbers because they have nothing to do with&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;as an individual. Like flipping a coin, there is only a 1 percent chance of it coming up heads 6 times in a row. But if it has come up heads 5 times in a row, the probability of it coming up heads on the next flip is…still 50/50.&nbsp;</p><p>An even larger unknown is whether there may be long-term effects associated with SARS-Cov-2, as is the case for many viruses. The 1918 influenza virus has been linked to a subsequent two-three fold increase in Parkinson’s disease by a mechanism we still don’t understand. The virus that gives children chicken pox will hide out in a person’s body for 40 years or more, and then emerge as a painful, sometimes debilitating, case of shingles. The 99 percent survivability rate of this virus is meaningless if, 20 years from now, it causes some devastating pulmonary or brain disease.</p><p>The main upside to vaccines is that because they use your already existing defense system, they are surprisingly safe. Safer than antibiotics, which have numerous side effects, because they are not part of our normal make up and are …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Protobuf needs no introduction, but this post argues that you shouldn’t use it for telemetry.
The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating.
Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. 
The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the <em>wire-format</em> itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.</p>

<h2 id="protobuf-java-is-a-little-heavy">Protobuf-java is a little heavy</h2>

<p>A few months ago I needed to become familiar with the Protobuf wire-format for a proof of concept.
The motivation for digging in to the wire-format, rather than just using <code>protobuf-java</code>, was the dimensions of the library, which I would need to bundle in an agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> <span>-c</span> %s protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar
1672950

<span>$ </span>jar <span>-tf</span> protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar | <span>grep</span> <span>'.class'</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
669
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just depending on the library adds 1.6MB and nearly 700 classes before you even generate your own message classes.
Since the deployment in question was an agent which can’t assume the presence of <code>protobuf-java</code> at runtime, there is no way to avoid bundling the extra 1.6MB.
Since the aforementioned agent implements <code>ClassLoader</code> isolation to avoid interfering with application class loading, even if <code>protobuf-java</code> <em>is</em> present at runtime, the classes would need to be loaded again by an isolated <code>ClassLoader</code>.</p>

<p>A tracer only needs to <em>produce</em> messages, so not all of those 669 classes (which doesn’t include your own generated classes) will get loaded, but a lot of them do.
Having since implemented library-neutral Protobuf serialisation in Datadog’s <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java">sketches-java</a>, I have a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java/blob/master/src/jmh/java/com/datadoghq/sketch/ddsketch/benchmarks/Serialize.java">point of comparison</a> to show how many classes get loaded in a write-only context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@OutputTimeUnit</span><span>(</span><span>TimeUnit</span><span>.</span><span>MICROSECONDS</span><span>)</span>
<span>@BenchmarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>Mode</span><span>.</span><span>AverageTime</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Serialize</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BuiltSketchState</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>serialize</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sketch</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>().</span><span>array</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>toProto</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>DDSketchProtoBinding</span><span>.</span><span>toProto</span><span>(</span><span>sketch</span><span>).</span><span>toByteArray</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since I mention a Datadog library and am a Datadog employee, I make clear that none of the opinions presented in this post or elsewhere on this blog represent those of my employer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each method produces identical bytes, and the purpose of the benchmark above is to compare speeds.
One of the methods relies on a single class consisting of fewer than 150 lines of code, including white-space, whereas the other depends on a large library.
For the record, the hand-written method <code>serialize</code> above is roughly 10x faster than using <code>protobuf-java</code>, but it’s not the point of this post. 
By running the benchmark for a single warmup iteration each, with the argument <code>-jvmArgsPrepend "-verbose:class"</code>, the classes which are loaded are logged, which I captured in separate files.
276 more classes are loaded when using <code>protobuf-java</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> serialize.log 
1400 serialize.log
<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> to_proto.log 
1676 to_proto.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you work at a large organisation which has entirely embraced Protobuf, I would not suggest worrying about 1.6MB or a few hundred loaded classes; these costs quickly amortise as you use the library for more features.
However, your resource budget for a diagnostic agent which tells you what your application is doing and how it’s performing should be tiny, and I’m not sure <code>protobuf-java</code> can be made to fit in to it, given the isolation constraints for agents outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="length-delimiters-are-costly-to-produce">Length delimiters are costly to produce</h2>

<p>This meant that I needed to write my own (which is a lot easier than it sounds if you haven’t done this sort of thing before) so I had to read the only documentation there is on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding</a>.
I couldn’t get the formatter I had written based on my first reading of this document to produce valid protobuf because I had skim-read the section on embedded messages, and because it includes a design decision that would never have occurred to me.
When I went back and read it again I was surprised to find that embedded messages are length-prefixed, but the length prefix is varint encoded, which means you don’t know how many bytes you need for the length until you’ve done the serialisation, and it’s recursive.</p>

<p>Length prefixes aren’t unusual in binary formats: BSON documents are prefixed by their sizes in bytes, meaning sub-documents need to be serialised recursively before their lengths can be written.
BSON makes this easy by not compressing the document length so you just leave 4 bytes for the length and come back and fill it in when popping document contexts (<a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/shrinking-bson-documents">it can add up to a significant portion of your database though</a>).
Msgpack, for example, <em>does</em> apply prefix compression of embedded element lengths (e.g. maps and arrays) but the length is an element count, not a number of bytes, which makes streaming serialisation a lot easier to do.</p>

<p>Protobuf does both, and, consequently, there’s no way to produce nested Protobuf messages without doing something relatively expensive.
You must either maintain a stack and copy contents from frame to frame as they are popped, or pre-compute serialised lengths of nested elements recursively; it isn’t possible to simply write serialised output sequentially to a stream as it is with other formats. 
I abandoned the proof of concept when I found that a streaming zero-allocation msgpack codec I had written was around 6x faster than either <code>protobuf-java</code> or a handwritten Protobuf codec for messages with nesting.
Since I couldn’t remove the nesting in the messages I needed to produce, I blamed the wire-format and moved on.</p>

<p>People who actually know Protobuf already know this (it’s literally written in the encoding manual), and understand the benefits which arise from this cost elsewhere (e.g. implementing partial deserialisation is easy, easy to skip over sections of the message), but lots of people don’t seem to understand the cost model the wire-format imposes.
If they did, there would probably be a lot less nesting in Protobuf as used in the wild.</p>

<p>This more or less concludes my argument against using Protobuf for telemetry: if you find for yourself that producing Protobuf messages is costly, it’s not even a case of a third party library making the wrong trade-offs for your application; it’s the wire-format itself at fault.
If you want to ship telemetry data out of an application and aim to minimise the impact on the application, even if you implement your own zero-allocation, micro-optimised codec, you shouldn’t choose Protobuf.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to segue into describing the wire-format for Protobuf 3, filling in a couple of the gaps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">Google’s encoding document</a>, but read the official document if you want to write your own.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-wire-format">Notes on the wire format</h2>

<p>Protobuf’s wire format is really simple: it’s just a list of tagged key-value pairs. 
Since readers have a schema to refer to, ambiguity is permissible and advantageous.
The logical structure of a Protobuf message is as below, with each tag followed by some bytes associated with the tag.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tag1:value1, tag3:value2, tag2:value3, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is a pseudo-Backus-Naur form of the wire format.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>body 	         ::= 	tagged_value*
tagged_value     ::=    tag value
tag              ::=    varint((field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type)
wire_type        ::=    VARINT | FIXED_64 | LENGTH_DELIMITED | GROUP_BEGIN | GROUP_END | FIXED_32
VARINT           ::=    0
FIXED_64         ::=    1
LENGTH_DELIMITED ::=    2
GROUP_BEGIN      ::=    3 (deprecated)
GROUP_END        ::=    4 (deprecated)
FIXED_32         ::=    5
value            ::=    varint | fixed_64 | length_delimited | fixed_32
fixed_64         ::=    double | long
length_delimited ::=    varint(N) byte{N}
fixed_32         ::=    float | int
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each data item has a tag, which contains the field number (as defined in the .proto file) and one of the four wire types still in use in Protobuf 3.
The tag is constructed by shifting the field number left by three bits and combining with the wire type, and then <em>varint-encoded</em> so it takes up less space.
Since there are only three bits for the wire type, there can only ever be eight wire types, and two have already been wasted on group begin and end markers (I don’t know the story behind these).
Given that <code>FIXED_32=5</code> with only two possible wire types left, I imagine that there were some tense meetings before deciding to add it.</p>

<p>The terminology above is my own, but notice that there are no terms like <code>repeated</code>, <code>oneof</code>, or <code>message</code>.
This is because they don’t exist at this level. 
<code>message</code> is just a length delimiter followed by some more protobuf, preceded by a <code>LENGTH_DELIMITED</code> tag; the schema has the necessary information to read the raw bytes.
<code>repeated</code> fields come in two kinds: packed and not packed. 
Packed <code>repeated</code> fields are indistinguishable from a <code>message</code> or a <code>string</code> on the wire.
<code>repeated</code> fields which aren’t packed are a list of tag-values with the same field number and the element type in each tag, and they don’t need to be contiguous within the message.
Incidentally, writers aren’t obliged not to repeat non-<code>repeated</code> fields, and as there is nothing to distinguish these fields over the wire, readers are obliged to take the <em>last value</em> for a non-<code>repeated</code> field (which makes some of the partial deserialisers I’ve seen illegal).</p>

<p><code>FIXED_32</code> corresponds to proto types <code>float</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>sfixed32</code>, whereas <code>FIXED_64</code> corresponds to <code>double</code>, <code>fixed64</code>, and <code>sfixed64</code>.
All other integers, which includes booleans, are <em>varint</em> encoded, which has the basic effect of removing leading zeros in order to save space.
Starting with the least significant bits, seven bits are taken at a time from the integer until no bits remain, and all but the last byte have their most significant bit set.
This allows the parser to detect the end of an integer by looking for a byte with the MSB unset. 
Whilst this saves space, it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>The idea of this post is to introduce and discuss several interesting research programs from the past decade. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">research program</a> (or programme) refers to a common thread of research that shares similar assumptions, methodology, etc. The list below contains a variety of research programs: some on topics that have broad appeal e.g. <a href="#machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">explainable machine learning</a> and <a href="#the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">mental disorder</a>; others moved the direction of entire industries e.g. advances in <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">computer vision</a> and <a href="#blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>; and others still are more niche areas that I happen to be deeply interested in e.g. <a href="#topological-learning-theory">topological learning theory</a>, <a href="#privacy-attacks-on-machine-learning-models">privacy attacks on ML models</a>, and <a href="#the-graph-theoretic-approach-to-epistemic-justification">graph-theoretic approaches to epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, a list of this variety can never be complete and is surely biased by what I happen to be reading. If I’ve missed something interesting that you enjoy, let me know at <a href="mailto:brettcmullins@gmail.com">brettcmullins@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="image-recognition-and-object-detection">Image Recognition and Object Detection</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is difficult for me to begin this list without first talking about the area that most affected my professional career, led to (or at least accelerated) a boom in data science, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history">potentially thawed an AI winter</a>. During the 2010s, <a href="https://bmk.sh/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/">deep learning made enormous progress</a> in heuristics and applications. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a> in particular, a good starting point is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a> in 2012 which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> architecture to substantially surpass existing benchmarks for image recognition - the task of assigning a label such as <em>cat</em>, <em>dog</em>, or <em>tree</em> to an image - on the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a>. Over the next few years, improvements would continue with architectures such as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c">VGG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNet</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">Inception</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>With progress being made with recognition, other tasks such as object detection - finding and labeling objects (sometimes multiple objects) within images - became more feasible. One approach to object detection introduced in 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524">Regional CNNs (or R-CNNs)</a> combined a model that first produced promising bounding boxes then utilized the newly developed recognition models (starting with AlexNet) to classify or label the regions in the bounding boxes. Over the next few years, progress in this direction was realized with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Fast R-CNN</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Faster R-CNN</a>. These frameworks not only employed better recognition models and found better bounding boxes, but they integrated the model components together so that they could be more efficiently trained or tailored to one’s application. <a href="https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4">Here is an excellent overview</a> of these models with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>Accompanying these new techniques and improvements was a large amount of software - with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffe_(software)">Caffe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)">Torch</a> at first then the more user friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras">Keras</a> - allowing anyone to implement these models for their use cases. It’s also worth mentioning the proliferation of online courses such as <a href="https://fast.ai/">fast.ai’s</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> that facilitated getting potential users up to speed to test out and deploy these tools.</p>

<h2 id="topological-learning-theory">Topological Learning Theory</h2>
<hr>

<p>Topological Learning Theory is the mathematical study of the learnability/solvability of hypotheses/problems that is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">theory of computation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">descriptive set theory</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference">classical statistics</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory">statistical learning theory</a>). The idea of learning theory is to analyze the learnability of hypotheses as one incrementally receives information about the true state of the world.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#1.1">classic example</a> is to consider an ornithologist observing the color of ravens as, say, black or not. With each raven observed, the ornithologist gains information which rules out some hypotheses but is consistent with others. By coding a black raven as 1 and other ravens as 0, we can mathematically represent possible observation histories as infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, i.e. points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space">Cantor space</a>. The crux of this approach is that the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_11/Lecture_Notes/dst_lecture_notes_2011_lec_2.pdf">topology on the Cantor space and other such spaces</a> naturally <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/kelly/learnreview.pdf">encodes the idea of information accumulation</a>. By considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy">descriptive complexity of hypotheses</a>, identifying a hypothesis with the set of sequences that make it true, we can say things about the learnability of the hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis “all ravens are black” is the set containing the single sequence of all 1s. We say that this hypothesis is falsifiable since if there is a non-black raven our ornithologist will eventually observe it; however, it is verifiable not in finite time but in the limit since the hypothesis is never conclusively true after any finite number of observations. This corresponds to the topological notion of properly being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%CF%83_set">$F_{\sigma}$ or $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set</a>.</p>

Advances in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computable+analysis">computable analysis</a> beginning in the early 2000s have enabled the extension of these classical formal learning theory results to a more general topological setting throughout the 2010s.

<h2 id="the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">The Disordered Mind Theory of Mental Illness</h2>
<hr>

<p>In a series of articles and books over the past decade, the philosopher <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/george-graham">George Graham</a> develops a theory of mental disorder with the following qualities: 1. is non-reductionist with respect to the mind and the brain; 2. is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a>; and 3. coheres with the experiences of patients and clinicians. Graham’s theory holds that mental illness is distinct from somatic/bodily illness though may co-occur or otherwise be bound up with so-called <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07609-001">broken brains</a>. A helpful analogy for what is meant here by “the mental” or “the mind” is to view the brain as computer hardware, whereas the mind is software. On this picture, the mind and the brain are surely not independent; a hardware issue may impede the computation of some software. However, one may have bugs in one’s software - “gumming up the works” to use a common phrase of Graham - on perfectly functioning hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.routledge.com/common/jackets/amazon/978036732/9780367322328.jpg" width="200" height="280"></p>

<p>This theory of mental disorder is developed in Graham’s text on mental illness in the context of the philosophy of mind: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Disordered-Mind/Graham/p/book/9780367322328"><em>The Disordered Mind</em></a>. A follow-up book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-abraham-dilemma-9780198728658?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Abraham Dilemma</em></a>, refines this theory for the case of delusion, religious delusion in particular (I discuss <em>The Abraham Dilemma</em> in greater detail in my <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/top-books-2020/#the-abraham-dilemma-a-divine-delusion">Top Books in 2020</a>). Graham’s latest book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/hearing-voices-and-other-matters-of-the-mind-9780190091149?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind</em></a> explores the unique properties and challenges of mental disorders in the presence of religious content. The disordered mind theory <a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-disordered-mind-an-introduction-to-philosophy-of-mind-and-mental-illness/">is not without its detractors</a> who hold that Graham goes too far in arguing that one need not situate and commit to positions in the philosophy of mind to reject the complete reduction of mental illness to neuroscience.</p>

<p>I took George Graham’s seminar on Philosophy and Mental Illness in 2014 at <a href="https://philosophy.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> and had several interesting chats with him about the metaphysics and definability of mental disorders.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">Machine Learning Interpretability and Explainability</h2>
<hr>

<p>The boom in data science and widespread use of machine learning models during the past decade was accelerated by innovations in model architectures as well as tools and software to train and deploy these models. In addition to the <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">progress with neural networks and deep learning</a>, algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost">XGBoost</a> allowed users to achieve state-of-the-art classification and regression performance without much effort. XGBoost in particular became so prevalent in both industry and ML competitions - as had logistic regression and other GLMs in the past - that it was not unreasonable for some to wonder whether or not <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d">we should just use XGBoost all the time</a>.</p>

<p>For all that these models gained in performance, they lost ground in being able to provide answers to questions from stakeholders, developers, and so forth when things went wrong as to why a model’s prediction was so far off or why does the computer vision model <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">think a banana is a toaster</a>. Two approaches were offered as a solution (three if you count “Who cares?! Let’s do nothing!”): interpretability and explanations. The former offers constraints on model building such as limiting the number of features used and restricting to linear models so that the model is sufficiently simple to allow the developer/user to reliably predict the model’s behavior with a reasonable amount of effort. The latter is a set of methods for generating reasons for a model’s behavior for arbitrarily complex models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490"><em>The Mythos of Model Interpretability</em></a> is an early effort to disentangle these terms and map the landscape for understanding models. Also see <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_blackboxes/">my attempt here</a> as well as Christoph Molnar’s ever-evolving text <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a>.</p>

<p><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://bcmullins.github.io/images/blog/best_articles_2018/anchor.png"></p>

<p>The approach that I find the most compelling stems from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME paper</a>. LIME (or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) is a method of generating an interpretable, i.e. linear, approximation of a model in the neighborhood of a given point in the feature space. This new model is then used to generate explanations by virtue of its interpretability. A second approach for classifiers called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a> - both are developed by the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/group.html">same research group at UW</a> that also developed XGBoost - produces a simple region of the feature space (a rectangle) where the model’s prediction holds with high probability for a given point. This region or anchor acts as a sort of sufficiency condition for classification. The image to the right illustrates these ideas with the dotted line being a local linear approximation and the …</p></div></div>

<p>I use Twitter, RSS, and numerous other mediums of information — from Telegram channels to standalone blogs.</p>
<p>Out of a thousand articles a hundred gets skimmed through. A few dozens make it to my "Read Later" list, and only a fraction I find worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>These worthy ones end up in <a href="https://drobinin.com/newsletter/">my weekly newsletter, the Tuesday Triage</a>, where I comment on the most intriguing articles I've read and share facts I learnt over the week.</p>
<p>Some of those trivia are not trivial at all, so I decided to condense this <em>crème de la crème of the Internet</em> in a subjective list of the best ones in no particular order.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="solresol"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol">Solresol</a> <a href="#solresol">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people know about the esperanto, an artificially created language. Way less people are aware of Solresol, another artificial language, built upon the musical grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your health good? - Redofafa?</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="logbook"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbook</a> <a href="#logbook">¶</a></h4>
<p>As developers we work with logs a lot. And the logs are stored in logbooks (or at least they were). What's the ethymology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how come a chip log was used to estimate a ship's speed? In the absence of GPS and without any visible clues about the speed of a ship in the open water, sailors started to throw wooden pieces with a tied strope (hence the definition of knots as nautical miles per hour!) into water and then measure the relative speed against such logs, hence the name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't surprise me when I think about this as a dish, and yet I'd probably never come up with that on my own.</p>

<p>The year is 1974. The American National Standards Institute introduces safety code and requirements for dry martinis, and boy-oh-boy are they good.</p>

<p>This example left me, to put it succinctly, flabbergasted for a brief moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>by the by or by the bye : INCIDENTALLY [defined as "by way of interjection or digression : by the way"]</p>

<p>I wonder if it will help me to up the game of interrupting folks in conversations.</p>

<p>Watch after my hands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ferment a liquid (beer, wine, or stock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take the foam from the top of the liquid (this is called <strong>barm</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use this foam to leaven a bread roll, and then put something inside it (now this is called a <strong>barm cake</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we do all of that in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, we most likely would put a pie as a filling (they also host the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-46620294/world-pie-eating-champion-crowned-in-wigan">World Pie Eating Championship</a>, so no surprise). And here it is, the pie barm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wigan, a whole savoury pie is served in a barm cake, known locally as a "Wigan Kebab".</p>

<h4 id="two-spaces-after-period"><a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/">Two spaces after period</a> <a href="#two-spaces-after-period">¶</a></h4>
<p>Back then people had to put two spaces after punctuation marks as typewriters had monospaced typesetting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why: Back when we used typewriters, every character was given the exact same amount of space on the page. That meant the letter i was given the same amount of space as the letter m, even though it clearly didn’t need it. This is called monospaced typesetting and it’s, well, spacey. We needed that extra space between sentences to make it easier to see the beginning of new sentences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days quite a few still do that; usually one can easily assume they've learnt to type not on a computer.</p>
<p>Rarely, one encounters someone like me, with a typewriter next to the keyboard, and just thinks I am stupid and don't know thine grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="erstwhile"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile">erstwhile</a> <a href="#erstwhile">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a beautiful word I unearthed recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverb erstwhile has been part of English since the 16th century, but it is formed from two words that are much older. It comes from the Old English words ær, meaning "early", and hwīl, which has much the same meaning as the modern word while. (The English word ere, meaning "before," is also descendant of ær.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as a synonim to "former", e.g "erstwhile enemies".</p>

<p>I am just surprised that this practice was eventually banned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia. According to Lynch, Baby James was just shy of the 11-pound weight limit for packages sent via Parcel Post, and his “delivery” cost his parents only 15 cents in postage (although they did insure him for $50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postage was cheaper than train tickets back then (and still is, actually), so I can't really blame the parents.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ek-number"><a href="https://digg.com/2018/how-different-countries-laugh-online">ek number</a> <a href="#ek-number">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I realize that speaking in one (two, three, ...) languages means there are corners of the Internet and/or world you can't appreciate, in the first place because you can't understand them.</p>
<p>So while knowing both English and Russian is usually more than enough to find an answer to almost any question, I still miss the jewels like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ek number," which loosely translates to "I rate this number one" — the "ek" itself means "one" in Hindi — is commonly used as an affirmative response to a joke. If you find something to be funny, you could always type "haha" or "hehe" in India, but you can also signal your enjoyment by responding "ek number."</p>

<h4 id="remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips"><a href="http://www.dandelionchocolate.com/2020/06/18/remy-chocolate-chip/">Remy Labesque and chocolate chips</a> <a href="#remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips">¶</a></h4>
<p>Chocolate chips have a water drop's shape because it's easier to make that way. It's harder to use though.</p>
<p>Remy Labesque, one of Tesla's designers, helped Dandelion Chocolate to invent a machine to make ideal chocolate chips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of a typical store-bought chocolate chip is an arbitrary result of the industrial manufacturing process used to make it. As you might expect, a drop of molten chocolate is deposited onto a flat surface and left to cool. Chocolate chip taste varies widely by brand, but the shape of the chips does not.</p>
<p>The shape of our chip is faceted: The edges of a Dandelion Chocolate chip taper to thin-as-we could-make-’em without compromising structure. This is because the thermal mass of a thin piece of chocolate melts more quickly on the palate. So when you put a Dandelion chip on your tongue, the thin, chiseled edges warm-to-melt nearly instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 lb of these chips costs 30$, not bad.</p>

<h4 id="ogden's-basic-english"><a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/">Ogden's Basic English</a> <a href="#ogden's-basic-english">¶</a></h4>
<p>Apparently removing all redundancies, synonims, etc from the English language leaves us only with 850 words or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this simplified language Basic English, the developer is Charles K. Ogden, and was released in 1930 with the book: Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar. He founded the Orthological Institute to develop the tools for teaching Basic English. His most famous associate, I.A. Richards, led the effort in the Orient, which uses the techniques to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting bit is, that change doesn't affect the grammar, so one could learn only 850 words and yet converse in English by using its grammar to its full extent.</p>

<h4 id="brick-pencil"><a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Brick pencil</a> <a href="#brick-pencil">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>, one of the people behind the creation of a computer mouse, and then graphical interfaces, argued about interfaces in his paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: a Conceptual Framework" in 1962 and to proof his point came up with a brick pencil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</p>

<h4 id="cosmic-latte"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte">Cosmic Latte</a> <a href="#cosmic-latte">¶</a></h4>
<p>Wikipedia sums it up well:</p>

<p>Cosmic latte is the average colour of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>For those keen on putting this into their apps, here is the colour: #FFF8E7.</p>

<h4 id="7-up's-history"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up#History">7-UP's history</a> <a href="#7-up's-history">¶</a></h4>
<p>In my childhood I used to love 7-UP a lot, mostly because it was nearly transparent hence felt less poisonous comparing to other sodas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably if I were to drink it until 1948 it'd be my favourite drink anyway, but not because of its (lack of) colour.</p>
<p>Also all myths about its name are hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, making it acidic on the pH scale and similar to other drinks of this type. [...]<br>
The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this one makes the most sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Britvic also claims that the name is a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<div>
<h2><strong>FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.</strong></h2>



<p>VIMAGE was first presented in the Paper <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/zec-vimage/">“Implementing a Clonable Network Stack in the FreeBSD Kernel” by Macro Zec in 2003</a> and VIMAGE code appeared first in FreeBSD 8.0, however it wasn’t until FreeBSD 12.0 that VIMAGE was built into FreeBSD GENERIC kernels and it is a bit of an overlooked feature.</p>



<p>If you have used jails before you might wonder what more VNET jails offer or why you would want to migrate from using localhost-based networking. VNET jails give each jail its own isolated copy of the network stack. They get everything from the IP layer up, creating a network stack that is entirely its own, almost anything you could do with a distinct host you can do with a jail and VNET.</p>



<p>VNET network stacks can be given interfaces from the host and once an interface has been delegated into a VNET jail it disappears from the view of the host, becoming only visible in the jail. FreeBSD offers the epair interface that acts as a virtual Ethernet cable. Give one end of an epair to a VNET jail and keep the other end in the host and you have a way to network between the host and the jail or even between multiple jails. Unlike normal jail networking a VNET jail is able to fully use the interface and once given the correct permissions it can perform packet captures and traces as if it were a full host.</p>



<p>VNET allows jails to be closer to full virtual machines with much less overhead and they offer the ability to test networking in isolation with a very similar environment to the jail host.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET with a jail</strong></h4>



<p>The best way to experiment with VNET is to create some test jails and play with their networks. With VNET it is easy and cheap to create a new separate network that will not interfere with the hosts configuration.</p>



<p>First to demonstrate the power the VNET provides we will create a simple jail that only isolates networking from the host. If we run the following three commands on a FreeBSD system we can create a simple jail:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=emptyjail persist vnet
    host # jexec emptyjail /bin/sh
    emptyjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
    options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
    groups: lo
    nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>The important flags to the jail command here are <em>persist</em> and <em>vnet</em>, <em>persist</em> keeps the jail around even though nothing is running inside of it, <em>vnet</em> creates the jail with its own VIMAGE network stack.</p>



<p>The jail we have created contains a loop back interface (lo0) but cannot see any of the interfaces from the host, it has been isolated at the network and process level. Because we do not specify a new root to use for the jails file system, it can see everything on the host file system as before, this can be really handy when you are developing and running tests that take advantage of VNET.</p>



<p>For our jail to be useful we need to be able to access network interfaces, VNET jails can be given any interface and once given to a jail they vanish from the view of the host network stack. When we want to network between the host and the jail we can use an epair(4) device. epair devices are a pair of Ethernet-like interfaces connected back to back, sort of like an emulated patch cable. Each side is denoted with a letter, they come as an ‘a’ and a ‘b’ part. If we create an epair and move one half into the jail, once it is configured we can communicate from the host to the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # ja    host # ifconfig epair create
    epair0a
    host # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128
            inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x2
            inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0a: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0a
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=29&lt;PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>This time when we create our jail we delegate one half of the epair to it. We need to configure the interface in the jail and on the host. Once we have the interfaces configured we can communicate between the host and jail (Note: when you delegate an interface to a jail all the configuration will be erased. You must configure the interface once it is inside the jail).</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=networkjail persist vnet vnet.interface=epair0b 
    host # jexec networkjail /bin/sh

    networkjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
            options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
            groups: lo
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
    networkjail # ifconfig epair0b inet 192.0.2.2/24 up     
    networkjail # exit

    host # ifconfig epair0a inet 192.0.2.1/24 up
    host # ping 192.0.2.2
    PING 192.0.2.2 (192.0.2.2): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 192.0.2.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.143 ms

    round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.069/0.106/0.143/0.037 ms
</code></pre>



<p>Python3 is installed on the host and as our jail doesn’t isolate the file system, all installed software is also available to the jail. We can use the http server built in to python3 to demonstrate a simple network service running inside the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # jexec networkjail sh -c "cd /usr/src; python3 -m http.server" 
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>



<p>With this a web browser on the host machine can be pointed at 192.0.2.2:8000 and we can browse around the structure of the FreeBSD source tree that lives in /usr/src. We can run any service that will run on a FreeBSD host from within this VNET jail. The difference here between older jail networking is that we can do anything with the epair that we could do with a real network interface such as place add it to a bridge.</p>



<p>When we remove networkjail the half of the epair that was delegated is returned to the host:</p>



<pre><code>    host # ifconfig epair0b
    ifconfig: interface epair0b does not exist
    host # jls -v
       JID  Hostname                      Path
            Name                          State
            CPUSetID
            IP Address(es)
         1                                /
            networkjail                   ACTIVE
            3
    host # jail -r networkjail
    host # ifconfig epair0b
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>When we destroy either half of the epair both halves will be removed from the system, even if the side delegated to a jail.</p>



<p>VNET offers a facility for local testing with a network segment that is very similar to a real network. It is possible to perform any action from the host as you would on a non-virtual network interface such as adding it to a bridge or firewalling.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET to isolate networks</strong></h4>



<p>We are not limited to using virtual interfaces when using VNET, but are able to delegate any interface on the host into the VNET. VNET opens up the opportunity to isolate out chunks of networks allowing us to build complex topologies such as soft routers and firewalls.</p>



<p>We can also use the isolation offered by VNET to offer services from a host on a particular interface that might be undesirable or destructive or if the address space that a piece of equipment uses clashes with the network that the host is on.</p>



<p>On this development machine we have network interfaces on two different networks, one is in the development environment and the other lives in the sandbox testing environment. Never can packets go between the two. The sandbox testing network is where virtual machines live, normally these bhyve machines are configured with a tap interface and they join the network via a bridge interface on the host. VNET allows us to do the same thing, but with jails.</p>



<p>Before we start we need to load the kernel modules for epair and bridge on the host, they normally load automatically on the host when you try to use them, but the jail is unable to do this.</p>



<pre><code>    host # kldload if_epair if_bridge</code></pre>



<p>VNET also allows us to give a physical network interface on the development host to a jail and from that jail create further sub VNET jails that are isolated from the hosts network:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=isojail persist vnet vnet.interface=em0 children.max=1</code></pre>

On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

In Scenario A as you make more money you allow your expenses to increase by 4% per year. In Scenario B as you make more money you allow your expenses to increase by only 1% per year. By allowing your costs to inflate by 3% less, the result is you end up with $1.5M additional in the bank by age 65 (and this is assuming you aren't investing any of these savings over the years).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

        <p>
          Did you ever wonder how 3D engines render objects on the screen? Or how graphics APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX are written? This course is a complete immersion on how CPU-based 3D engines work. We will use C to develop a complete 3D engine from scratch, pixel by pixel, triangle per triangle. This is a basic course that requires no prior knowledge, but you will probably make the most of it if you know already the basics of programming.

        <p>
          This course is a complete journey into the world of 3D rendering. We will learn how to represent and display 3D objects without any graphics API. No OpenGL. No DirectX. No GPU. Just you, your C compiler, a smoking processor, and an array of pixel colors willing to dance 90's style. You will learn how to draw pixels, rasterize lines, triangles, complex 3D models, and understand the theory and the math behind computer graphics programming. If you want to understand how computer graphics really work, join us now!

                  <p>Been waiting for a course like this for years.  A lot of the theory of 3d graphics is availablein books and online , but none that put it into practice in such a clear way (if at all) . Also using C which I am more comfortable using than OOP (i'm a bit old school) .  It is a great refresher on C too, its a big project so far (only a bout 1/3 of the way through), but loving it so far.  </p>

                  <p>This course going into details which are usually if not always omitted by other courses in this category. I liked that the math and actual algorithms were discussed before implementing them and student own problem solving opportunity was encouraged throughout. This course has enabled me to fill in the critical gaps in some of the most important fundamental concepts in 3d graphics programming. Hope to see more!! Thank you.</p>

I bought it because I want to support those kind of materials! I basically learned all this stuff by myself through books and articles, but this course is a all in one place to learn them all at once, in a fun/approachable and motivating way that will make you save some precious time. Even if this is a good refresher for me and I already had the "clicks" before, I'll recommend it for anyone wanting to become a graphics/game/programmer !</p>

<h3 id="keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments">Keyword arguments are now fully separated from positional arguments<a href="#keyword-arguments-are-now-fully-separated-from-positional-arguments"></a></h3>

<p>The separation which <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">started in 2.7</a> with deprecations, is now fully finished. It means  keyword arguments are not a “syntax sugar” on top of hashes, and they never converted into each other implicitly:</p>

  <li><strong>Notes:</strong> There is a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/">big and detailed explanation</a> of the separation reasons, logic, and edge cases on Ruby site, written at the dawn of 2.7, so we will not go into more details here.</li>

<h3 id="arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">Arguments forwarding (<code>...</code>) supports leading arguments<a href="#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments"></a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Argument forwarding, when <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">introduced in 2.7</a>, was able to forward only all-or-nothing. It turned out to be not enough. One of the important usages for leading arguments are cases like <code>method_missing</code> and other DSL-defined methods that need to pass to the nested method <code>:some_symbol</code> + all of the original arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16378">Feature #16378</a></li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/doc/syntax/methods_rdoc.html#label-Argument+forwarding"><code>doc/syntax/methods.rdoc</code></a> <em><small>(the link is to a <code>master</code> version, docs were merged post 3.0 release)</small></em></li>
  <li><strong>Code:</strong>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>request</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{})</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>method</span><span>.</span><span>upcase</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>#{</span><span>url</span><span>}</span><span> (headers=</span><span>#{</span><span>headers</span><span>}</span><span>)"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>request</span><span>(</span><span>:get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://example.com'</span><span>,</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{</span><span>content_type: </span><span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
<span># GET https://example.com (headers={:content_type=&gt;"json"})</span>

<span># Leading arguments may be present both in the call and in the definition:</span>
<span>def</span> <span>logged_get</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>message</span>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Notes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>“all arguments splat” <code>...</code> should be the last statement in the argument list (both on a declaration and a call)</li>
      <li>on a method declaration, arguments before <code>...</code> can only be positional (not keyword) arguments, and can’t have default values (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>on a method call, arguments passed before <code>...</code> can’t be keyword arguments (it would be <code>SyntaxError</code>);</li>
      <li>make sure to check your punctuation thoroughly, because <code>anything ...</code> is a syntax for endless range, those constructs are valid syntax, but would do not what is expected:
        <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegates</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># call without "()" -- actually parsed as (p()...)</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>...</span>
  <span># Prints nothing, but warns: warning: ... at EOL, should be parenthesized?</span>

  <span># "," accidentally missing after 1, there is just one argument: 1...</span>
  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># Prints "1..."</span>

  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># Prints, as expected:</span>
  <span>#   1</span>

<h3 id="endless-method-definition">“Endless” method definition<a href="#endless-method-definition"></a></h3>

<p>Methods of exactly one statement now can be defined with syntax <code>def method() = statement</code>. (The syntax doesn’t need <code>end</code>, hence the “endless definition” moniker.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Ruby’s <code>end</code>s (unlike C-like languages’ <code>{}</code>) are generally OK for Rubyists, but make small utility methods look more heavy than they should. For small utility methods with body containing just one short statement like:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>available?</span>
  <span>!</span><span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>…the “proper” definition might look so heavy that one will decide against it to leave the class more readable (and instead make class’ clients to just do <code>obj.internal.empty?</code> themselves, making it less semantical). For such cases, a shortcut one-line definition may change the perceiving of utility method creation:</p>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>available?</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span>
<span>def</span> <span>finished?</span> <span>=</span> <span>available?</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>all?</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:finished?</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>clear</span> <span>=</span> <span>@internal</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span>

      <li>The initial proposal seems to be a good-natured April Fool’s joke, then everybody suddenly liked it, and, with a slight change of syntax, it was accepted;</li>

<p><strong>Pattern matching, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#pattern-matching">introduced in 2.7</a>, is no longer experimental.</strong> Discussion: <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>.</p>

<h4 id="one-line-pattern-matching-with-">One-line pattern matching with <code>=&gt;</code><a href="#one-line-pattern-matching-with-"></a></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reason:</strong> This is an interesting one. Two facts were discussed between 2.7 and 3.0: the fact that in most of the other languages one-line pattern matching has a different order (<code>&lt;pattern&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;data&gt;</code>) than introduced in Ruby 2.7 (<code>&lt;data&gt; in &lt;pattern&gt;</code>); and the idea of “rightward assignment operator” <code>=&gt;</code> for more natural chaining. And then, at some point, ideas converged most fruitfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17260">Feature #17260</a>  (main pattern matching tracking ticket), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16670">Feature #16670</a>  (reverse order), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15921">Feature #15921</a>  (standalone rightward assignment operator), <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15799">Feature #15799</a>  (abandoned “pipeline operator” idea, in discussion of which “rightward assignment” was born)</li>

      <li>One quirk that might be non-obvious: pattern matching can desconstruct-assign only to local variables, so when using <code>=&gt;</code> as an assignment operator, you will see those are syntax errors:

		<p>Let’s come back, more directly, to a theme in my writing — what happens when something small becomes a tipping point for change. <strong>When the seemingly innocuous becomes unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve only casually followed the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/why-are-there-so-many-protests-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong protests</a> and reaction from the Chinese mainland and overseas Chinese communities, you might wonder about the importance and meaning of the covered eye. Specifically, the right eye.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters found one of their many symbols (and there are many) when police shot and injured the right eye of a protesting woman in August. The injured eye is a more powerful symbol than even that of the man police shot on October 1 (Chinese National Day) in the chest (that is, <em>the heart</em>).</p>
<p>But since the now famous protester’s eye injury we’ve seen company ad campaign apologies and even an individual arrest all because of missing eyes.</p>
<p>But the eye I was reminded of was none of these. It was a different eye — also a right eye and in China — that over 40 years ago had results reminiscent to those eyes of today.</p>

<p>If you are a student of Chinese Cultural Revolution artwork, you might recognize this painting of an owl by Huang Yongyu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg" alt="Huang Yongyu's owl with one closed eye" width="400" height="607" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Huang served three and a half years in a labor camp for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/huang-yongyu/owl-1973">painting was interpreted</a> as a “portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings.” It’s not clear if he meant it as such.</p>
<p>Huang’s owl was one of many works of art gathered for a “black painting” (meaning counter-revolutionary) <a href="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6w1007nt&amp;chunk.id=d0e11683&amp;toc.id=d0e10324&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=bkd0e11803#X">exhibition and criticism</a> meeting in the 1970s. In some cases, officials had to scrounge around to find more “black painters” to have enough art to criticize. If you read some of the art descriptions, it seems like at least some of the artists were just unlucky rather than counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>And while I haven’t seen anyone publicly connect Huang’s winking owl with the protests of today, I imagine people with longer memories think about it.</p>
<p>Next in chronology we have of course the event from this summer in Hong Kong. A woman attending a protest was shot in her right eye. Covering one’s <a href="https://www.thelily.com/an-eye-for-an-eye-how-one-womans-eye-patch-became-the-symbol-of-the-hong-kong-protests/">right eye</a> soon became a symbol.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1496"><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hong-Kong-eye-e1572126020800.png" alt="Covering the right eye" width="600" height="309"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1496">from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/13/how-bloody-eye-patches-became-latest-symbol-escalating-hong-kong-protests/">Washington Post</a> article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as a good symbol, it is impossible to ignore (you can’t look away from someone’s eyes and still talk). As a good symbol it also brings the eye-patch wearers themselves into some discomfort.</p>
<p>The eye symbol became even better known when a foreign company felt pressure to remove and apologize for an old ad that predated the Hong Kong protests, but which happened to include a covered right eye.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/742601426037240952/">Tiffany ad</a> (since removed) that pre-dates the protests.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - one covered eye" width="474" height="554" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg 474w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>And here’s <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/08/tiffany-removes-advert-hong-kong-controversy/">another Tiffany ad</a>, also removed following complaints to the company for stirring up social disorder.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - covered right eye" width="525" height="273" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-300x156.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-768x399.jpg 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>And to compare, here’s another picture of Sun Feifei (the same model in the second Tiffany ad) covering her right eye in another photo shoot, also months before the protests in Hong Kong. And actually shown on a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/photos/2010-04/20/content_19863707.htm">government-run website, even today</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg" alt="Tiffany model covering her right eye" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg 400w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>So eye covering can look like a matter of intent. The china.org.cn right eye picture can obviously have no connection to the Hong Kong protests. But a foreign company is different, even with ads shot months before the covered eye became a protest symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, the covered eye — again, the right eye — has been used famously before in an ad campaign: “The Man in the Hathaway Shirt.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg" alt="Man in the Hathaway shirt" width="525" height="706" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg 595w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-223x300.jpg 223w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>No political meaning. Just an Ogilvy ad with the eyepatch used as a gimmick.</p>
<p>But there’s more again.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://shanghaiist.com/2019/10/08/houston-rockets-fan-detained-for-posting-photo-of-himself-about-to-burn-chinese-flag/">Houston Rockets fan in China</a> (the same team whose manager posted a “Stand with Hong Kong” tweet) was much too cynical on the ability of his government to track him down.</p>
<p>The first line (after the hashtag) says: “I live and die with my team.” The second line: “Come and catch me.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-1024x546.jpg" alt="Covered right eye, now in jail" width="525" height="280" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-300x160.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>They caught him, just a few hours later. And it appears he covered an eye to make facial identification more difficult. But again, what if he hadn’t covered his eye?</p>
<p>The apology from Tiffany strikes an international audience as the exportation of anti-protester values. The above picture of the NBA fan chained in a “tiger chair” strikes an international audience as not the future they want for themselves. <strong>Has the visual symbol of the eye — uncontrollable once the injury and advertisements happened — helped spread this message further?</strong></p>
<h2>Wearing of Masks</h2>
<p>Should protesters anywhere be allowed to wear masks? While a number of US states already had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/10/22/boston-and-hong-kong-debate-over-masks/JYajFCkul7UMw7PaXyZ5vL/story.html">mask bans in public spaces</a>, general public opinion seemed even more in support of the bans after a number of mask wearing Antifa members beat up a reporter in Portland earlier this year. The argument against masks was that covering one’s face minimize the feeling of social disapproval and led to worse behavior.</p>
<p>The US has at times overturned mask bans, famously after the Iranian Revolution as a way to protect Iranian protesters in California. But those masked were protesting a government from which they had fled to the US. It’s a different story when the protesters are domestic.</p>
<p>But a different explanation emerged in the Hong Kong protests now that we have <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/emergence-of-omniscience-part-1-images/">identity at scale</a>. Protesters had already taken cautions to avoid identification by using single-use MTR (metro) transit cards and paying in cash. But faces could be identified at scale either live or in the near future by capturing records of protest attendance, assessing behavior, and following up with repercussions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters also try to take down eyes on the crowd in the form of smart lampposts. There are a number of videos of them <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/24/tear-gas-kwun-tong-hong-kong-protesters-surround-police-station-dismantle-surveillance-lampposts/">dismantling these lampposts</a> out of fear of surveillance.</p>
<p>For me it’s interesting to reflect on the news from Hong Kong because Hong Kong is a place I have visited over almost 30 years. During that time, I also lived there for around six years. Five of the visits and about one year of the living there was pre-Handover. In the time leading up to 1997, I observed (can’t really say I demonstrated) in a few events. These fell into a few types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marches, often along Queen’s Road, in crowds in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Sit-down demonstrations outside of the New China News Agency (the NCNA was the de facto Chinese embassy pre-Handover).</li>
<li>June 4th remembrances in Victoria Park (including the last pre-Handover one), often culminating in the crowd holding lit candles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwsPt854Xo">Cui Jian’s <em>Nothing To My Name</em></a> would always be played (a song popular at 1989 Tiananmen).</li>
</ul>
<p>No one wore a mask, because there wasn’t any need to do so. The protest leaders were already known. The crowd was safe in numbers. I never heard anyone fear identification, even post-Handover.</p>
<p>If you contrast the protesters of back then with those of the last six months, they are unrecognizable.</p>
<p>That protesters hide their faces and cut down smart lampposts makes sense. Like the eyes in the advertisements above, the lampposts may not have any intent to use facial recognition to identify protesters, but there is no trust. Anything can look suspicious. If the capability is there to help your adversary, then you assume they use it. Especially if there are examples of mass surveillance already in place, for example in the Chinese province of <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Xinjiang</a>.</p>
<h2>Consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identity at scale can weaken trust.</li>
<li>Visual symbols can spread a message.</li>
<li>Huang Yongyu’s owl paintings now sell at auction.</li>
</ul>

    <p>An agora, in its broadest sense, is a conceptual space where people attempt to bring an increased level of intentionality, explicitness, and mutual agreement to the principles and protocols for interacting in that space. A further aspect of the idea of an Agora is that it is a space which enables collaboration. In particular, it is a space that allows for collaboration guided by specific shared interests, without requiring the co-consitutients of the agora to be aligned more fully or generally in terms of their intentions, values, etc. </p>
<p>Some topics that the idea of an Agora is related to: <a href="http://anagora.org/node/transparency" rel="nofollow">transparency</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/decentralized-structures" rel="nofollow">decentralized structures</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/egalitarian-principles" rel="nofollow">egalitarian principles</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/algorithms-of-interaction" rel="nofollow">algorithms of interaction</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/communication" rel="nofollow">communication</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/collaboration" rel="nofollow">collaboration</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/knowledge-sharing" rel="nofollow">knowledge sharing</a></p>
<p>There are (infinitely) many possible variants of how this idea might be implemented in concrete, real-world situations. For example, an agora could be a space that is opened up inside a conversation between two people. Or it could be a collaborative project that is accompanied by specified rules. Or it could be a collective agreement about how to handle certain types of situations. </p>
<p>One variant of the idea of an Agora is a place where personal notes are shared, with the common goal of pooling information and sharing knowledge. One implementation of this idea is <a href="https://anagora.org/" rel="nofollow">https://anagora.org</a>. See also <a href="https://flancia.org/go/agora" rel="nofollow">https://flancia.org/go/agora</a>.</p>
<p>The term "Agora" and the basic idea come from <a href="http://anagora.org/node/flancia" rel="nofollow">Flancia</a>. </p>

<p>Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta has now been updated 8 times since its launch back in October. The latest software version for FSD Beta is 2020.48.12.15, which is slightly on a different version path from the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/26/tesla-holiday-update-2020-48-26-is-here-v11-gets-delayed-release-notes-video/">2020.48.26 Holiday Update</a>.</p>



<p>The Dual-Motor Tesla Model S with the license plate shouting AIDRIVR has the privilege of being one of the few out there selected by Tesla for FSD Beta testing. In the following video, the owner and driver of this unique Model S takes his car for checking FSD Beta performance out in the snow. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Tesla Model S</a> in this video is equipped with summer-focused all-season tires, so traction and handling could’ve been better with the winter tires. Tesla’s <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s-19_-slipstream-wheel-and-winter-tire-package" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online shop</a> offers winter wheels and tire packages for the entire vehicle lineup. The Tesla Model S 19″ slipstream winter wheel and tire package range from $2,500 to $4,000. This Model S package includes the 4 x 245/45/19 – Pirelli Sottozero 3 tires.</p>



<p>In the newer Teslas, the Autopilot cameras are heated, so there is a lower probability of the car’s vision becoming blurred due to snow accumulation. </p>

<p>FSD Beta 8 in this series of tests is first evaluated in an almost empty parking lot with lots of snow. In the beginning, the car refuses to engage <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Autopilot</a> because of invisible road markings. Even when it accepts to be engaged in this snow-filled space, it gets confused and the driving is jerky, at last, it asks the driver to take over and disengages and comes to a full stop when not taken over.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/18/autopilot-fsd-beta-will-get-absurdly-good-says-elon-musk-v7-test-videos/">FSD Beta 7 test videos in different scenarios.</a></p>



<h2>On the snowy roads</h2>



<p>In the next phase, the driver puts <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">FSD Beta</a> on a snowy road to test if it works properly. Lane markings are pretty abrupt even after the heavy snowfall is cleared from the road. Lower grip because of non-winter tires is also a limiting factor here, Autopilot might handover the car to the driver if it feels the slippery situation is not safe.</p>

</figure>



<p>At the start of the test, Autopilot was able to predict the drivable space but on its own, it was following the posted speed limit of 30 mph. The cruise speed limit then was set to 15 mph manually, in order to be on the safe side in these snowy conditions.</p>



<p>In the drive ahead, the driver had to take over a couple of times, otherwise Tesla Autopilot was able to handle the path pretty well.</p>



<p>By watching the video closely and from the driver’s feedback it can be easily said that <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/autopilot/">Tesla Autopilot (FSD Beta)</a> is not yet ready for snowy conditions. It will be a while before Autopilot fully learns snow and the scenarios it puts in front of a car driver. However, the video is still fun to watch and I like the owner’s commentary as he has a good grip on the topic of FSD testing.</p>

<p>Below is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are
freely available online, usually because they are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open textbook (such as PLAI, SF, or the HoTT book)</li>
  <li>An older book that is out of print, for which the copyright has returned to the original author(s)
(such as TTFP)</li>
  <li>An author’s own preprint or draft of a textbook.  This includes cases where the author has made
special arrangements with a publisher to host an electronic copy of a published text on their
homepage while it remains in print.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these I’ve only used for brief personal reference, and have not read in depth.  The exceptions, those books I’ve spent considerable time with and highly recommend, are marked with asterisks.</p>

<p>I also include below a list of papers I consider good stand-alone introductions to certain topics, and a list of links to thorough special topics courses.</p>

<p>If you find one of the links below is broken or has moved, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Those with time to spare and looking to have less of it may enjoy browsing the QA call numbers in <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">UPenn’s extensive listing of online books</a>.  Most of those listed here were found independently over the years, but I’ve just now (June 2020) learned of this excellent repository of links.  I’ll add to the links below as I find promising books.</p>

				<p>This post recounts the journey of writing
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent">cratetorrent</a>, interesting
optimizations, and some of the insights gained.</p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Growing up, torrenting was a big thing around me. I was always curious how it
worked.</p>
<p>This curiosity only grew after I had gotten into programming and understood more
details. There is a piece of technology that is so effective yet simple, that,
without any marketing, it gained widespread adoption due to sheer technical
superiority. It just worked and people used it.</p>
<p>So why not write one? I tried, in C++. It was never finished and it’s probably
better that way. Let’s forget it.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few years. I got into Rust and needed a familiar playground to
practice the language. I did what anyone in such a situation would do: I wrote
another torrent engine. It’s torrent engines all the way back.</p>
<p>Thus was cratetorrent born. The name is a wordplay on the C++
<a href="https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent"><code>libtorrent</code> library</a>. Its code and
blog were highly educational during my first attempt. This is my thanks.</p>
<h2 id="torrent-101">Torrent 101</h2>
<p>So how <em>do</em> torrents work?</p>
<p>A brief overview of the BitTorrent V1
protocol follows. For those familiar, feel free to skip to the <a href="#key-optimizations">next
section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>BitTorrent is a <em>mostly</em> decentralized file-sharing protocol: it consists of
potentially many symmetrical clients exchanging arbitrary data.</p>
<p>Its advantage over downloading from a single host is that the load is
distributed among all participants in the torrent, thereby increasing
availability, scalability, and often download speed, too.</p>
<p>It used to be highly popular, as everyone used it to share…Linux distros, yes,
and other <em>definitely legal content</em>. Nowadays it’s still in use, but its
use cases are more subtle: e.g. Windows 10 uses BitTorrent, or something like
it, to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/windows-10-uses-your-bandwidth-to-distribute-updates-d-1721091469">distribute
updates</a>
among its users.</p>
<h3 id="whos-in-a-torrent">Who’s in a torrent?</h3>
<p>The first actor on the stage is the torrent <em>metainfo</em> file. It contains basic
metadata about the torrent, most importantly its name, its files with their
paths and lengths, and its <em>trackers</em>. These files are usually hosted by
torrenting sites and this is what you download when starting a torrent.</p>
<p>So what are these trackers? While the download of the content itself is fully
decentralized, a client needs to know which other clients it can download from.
Such other clients in the torrent’s <em>swarm</em> are called <em>peers</em>. Peers that have
all the data are <em>seeds</em>, the rest are <em>leeches</em>. A bit of an uncomfortable
term.</p>
<p>Therefore at the beginning of a download a client asks trackers about
peers. Trackers are the only centralized part of the protocol.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Once done,
the client connects these peers and begins downloading data.</p>
<h3 id="data-representation">Data representation</h3>
<p>A torrent may have one or more files but from the point of view of the wire
protocol they are all just one big contiguous sequence of bytes.</p>
<p>This byte sequence is cut up into equal sized <em>pieces</em>, which are further cut up
into 16 KiB <em>blocks</em>. Peers exchange these blocks of data and use them to
reassemble the torrent’s files.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A peer can only share the complete pieces it has. However, breaking up a piece
into blocks enables downloading it from multiple peers, potentially
completing it sooner. Once complete, the peer can immediately share it with
other peers, even if it does not have all pieces itself. This increases
availability, a key feature of the protocol.</p>
<p>A tricky part here is that files are not padded to align with piece boundaries.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-data-repr.svg" alt="data representation">
</figure>



<p>This has two consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>the last piece may be smaller than the rest,</li>
<li>and pieces may not align with file boundaries, both shown above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore when writing blocks to disk, they may have to be split across several
files. The logic can get quite gnarly here if done optimally.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="the-peer-protocol">The peer protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>After the client connected the peer via TCP, they exchange handshakes.</li>
<li>One or both tells the other that it can start requesting blocks.</li>
<li>The client then requests a block from a piece it chose<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, its peer sends it,
and the client saves it.</li>
<li>Repeat until finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s about it, but perhaps surprising no one, a real world implementation will
be quite a bit more complex. Let’s see some of the complications.</p>
<h2 id="key-optimizations">Key optimizations</h2>
<p>(But nothing premature, promise!)</p>
<h3 id="download-pipelining">Download pipelining</h3>
<p>A naive implementation might do what was outlined above: send requests
sequentially, one after the previous request was served. The problem with it is
that it doesn’t utilize the connection’s capacity.</p>
<p>To do so, we try to estimate a connection’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product">bandwidth-delay
product</a> for each peer
that the client is downloading from. This is the maximum amount of data that can
be on the link at any given time–that is, the sent but not yet received bytes.</p>
<p>So to get the best performance we keep as many requests outstanding as would
fill the link’s capacity.</p>
<p>A picture makes this explanation a lot more pleasant:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-request-pipeline.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>It’s clearly visible that in the same amount of time, a lot more requests could
be fulfilled. This is the number one most important optimization, strongly
recommended by the spec itself.</p>
<p>Cratetorrent uses a running average for the download rate and a simplified model
of the BDP, by assuming the latency to be a constant 1 second, to get the
request queue size:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> request_queue_size <span>=</span> download_rate <span>/</span> BLOCK_LEN;
</code></pre></div><p>The 1 second value was chosen for simplicity, but it’s a reasonable guess if we
take the link to mean the full request round-trip from one peer’s disk to that
of another.</p>
<h3 id="slow-start">Slow start</h3>
<p>The above suggests an interesting problem: what’s the fastest way of
arriving at the link’s capacity? Taking time to get to this optimum number costs
time. No good.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is a solved problem. To find the answer we just have
to peek one layer below in the network stack: <strong>TCP</strong>.</p>
<p>When a TCP connection is set up, the protocol tries to find the right congestion
window size. This is a fancy way of saying “the number of bytes to send that
doesn’t choke the remote host and everything else in between but still makes use
of the network capacity.” Our purposes are similar.</p>
<p>This is roughly what TCP does:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the start of the connection, set the congestion window size to some
constant.</li>
<li>Send an equivalent number of segments to peer.</li>
<li>For each ACK (acknowledgement message) received, increase the window size by
1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each time all ACKs are received for a volley of segments, the window size
doubles. This growth is exponential, yet the algorithm is confusingly called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control#Slow_start">slow start</a>
(presumably named after the thing it tries to avoid).</p>
<p>TCP stops growing the window when the first timed out or dropped segment is
detected. This would be difficult to replicate in user-space, so cratetorrent
instead increases the request queue size every time a block is received, and
<a href="https://github.com/mandreyel/cratetorrent/blob/master/cratetorrent/src/peer/state.rs#L300-L316">stops</a>
when the download rate isn’t increasing much anymore.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://mandreyel.github.io/images/cratetorrent-slow-start.svg" alt="download pipelining benefits">
</figure>



<p>With each served request, more requests are sent, and the connection is getting
closer to fully using the available bandwidth (the non-blue area is shrinking).</p>
<h3 id="endgame-mode">Endgame mode</h3>
<p>I noticed that sometimes the last phase of a download gets stagnant, barely
progressing from one block to the next.</p>
<p>This happens when the last pending pieces are downloaded from slow peers, which
can delay the completion of a download by a surprising amount.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, this issue is also solved–mentioned in the spec, in fact:</p>
<p>While normally each block is requested from a single peer, blocks in the last
pending pieces should be downloaded from all peers, on a “whoever sends it
first” basis. Once they arrive, requests to the slower peers are simply
cancelled. This wastes some bandwidth but saves quite a bit of time.</p>
<hr>
<p>These were the most significant design choices in terms of how they affected
performance. There are a few more but neither you or I have forever. So let’s
move on and see how all this translates into Rust.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Cratetorrent employs asynchronous IO on the network side, and a thread-pool
backed blocking IO on the disk side. It uses
<a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a> for both, the de facto async IO
runtime in Rust.</p>
<p>The engine’s main components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>engine</strong> itself, which manages torrents and executes the library user’s
commands.</li>
<li>One or more <strong>torrents</strong>, each corresponding to a single torrent
upload/download. They manage their peers and trackers.</li>
<li>Torrents have an arbitrary number of <strong>peer sessions</strong>, which represent
connections with peers from start to finish. This entity implements the
BitTorrent wire protocol and is as such on the lowest layer.</li>
<li><strong>Disk IO</strong> is handled by an entity of its own, for clarity and separation of
concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are separate <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.13/tokio/task">tasks</a>
(essentially application level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green
threads</a>). Because tasks are
as good as separate threads from the point of view of the borrow-checker, shared
access is not permitted without synchronization. There are two ways to do that.</p>
<h3 id="task-event-loop">Task event loop</h3>
<p>Control flow between tasks is primarily implemented via asynchronous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing"><em>message
passing</em></a>, using
multiple-producer single-consumer
<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels"><em>channels</em></a>. Each task is
reactive: it has an <em>event loop</em> and it reacts to internal events and messages
from other tasks.</p>
<p>Torrents and peer sessions perform a periodic “tick” (like the tick of a clock),
once a second currently, to update their internal state and broadcast messages.
This is when alerts (such as periodic download statistics or “download
complete”) are sent to the library user for example.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>A torrent’s event loop might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>loop</span> {
    select<span>!</span> {
        <span>// periodic tick
</span><span></span>        _ <span>=</span> tick_timer.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            self.tick().<span>await</span><span>?</span>;
        }
        <span>// peers wanting to connect
</span><span></span>        peer_conn_result <span>=</span> incoming.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> Ok(socket) <span>=</span> peer_conn_result {
                self.handle_incoming_peer(socket)<span>?</span>;
            }
        }
        <span>// commands from other parts of the engine
</span><span></span>        cmd <span>=</span> self.cmd_rx.select_next_some() <span>=&gt;</span> {
            self.handle_cmd(cmd).<span>await</span><span>?</span>;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>(<code>select!</code> is a macro that waits on all streams and returns the item produced by
the first ready stream. And streams are just types that eventually produce a
<em>stream</em> of values over time.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="postTitle"><p>written December 28, 2020 // 1246 words</p></div><div id="mainText"><p>Recently, I’ve been reading <strong>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</strong> written by none other than Yuval Noah Harari, and have been enjoying the book. Its approach to weaving together insights from a vast number of disciplines to create something novel is extremely refreshing. I just read a section on learning, the knowledge illusion, and collaborative thinking and wanted to share some of my thoughts that have been bouncing around and marinating for a few days as well as some learnings that I’ve applied to my own life.</p><h2 id="collaborative-thinking">Collaborative Thinking</h2><blockquote><p>Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. Just as it takes a tribe to raise a child, it also takes a tribe to invent a tool, solve a conflict, or cure a disease. No individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb, or an aircraft.</p></blockquote><p>It is no secret that the key to the rise of <em>Homo Sapiens</em> and the anthropocene wasn’t due to the rationality of any individual human, but rather our collective unparalleled ability to think and share knowledge in large groups. This concept has arisen in the form of <em>specialization of labour</em>.</p><p>As a society, we consistently rely on the knowledge of others to live our own comfortable lives. I may not know how to grow my very own russet potatoes, but a farmer in Alberta might. Similarly, a plumber in Massachusetts may not know how to build their own website, but I might. Through being able to supplement each other’s knowledge of the world, our <em>collective</em> knowledge is much greater.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/knowledge.png" alt="Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge"><em>Left: Collective knowledge of the group. Right: My subset of knowledge</em></p><p>I like to think about collective knowledge as a big blob. Each individual contributes a unique <em>subset</em> of knowledge. We get the entirety of human knowledge by taking the <em>union of the knowledge</em> of all the individuals in the group. Of course, as these groups of individuals grow ever larger due to globalization, each individual may choose to specialize in a narrower subset of knowledge as generations go on to reduce redundancy. Why know how to build your own car when you can buy it yourself? The adoption of globally accepted currencies has made this easier than ever.</p><h2 id="knowledge-illusion">Knowledge illusion</h2><p>Humans also have this ‘knowledge illusion’ where we think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little. We treat the knowledge of the human collective as if it were our own, even subconsciously.</p><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/zipper.png" alt="A crude illustration of a jacket zipper"><em>A crude illustration of a jacket zipper</em></p><p>An example Harari used was the sweater zipper. If I were to ask you if you knew how a zipper works, the vast majority of you would exclaim “yes, of course!” Yet, if asked to describe in <em>detail</em> every single step, most would fail to do so. Even with something that seems so basic and intuitive seems to elude an explicit explanation. We have begun to stand on the shoulders of giants yet refuse to acknowledge their presence.</p><p>Although we may have increased the overall area of our collective knowledge, the surface area of each individual has also shrunken, turning from balanced and broad to narrow and unwieldy.</p><h2 id="rebalancing-our-blob-of-knowledge">Rebalancing our blob of knowledge</h2><p>Another interesting property about the knowledge blobs of individuals is that they are <em>magnetic</em>. I mean this in the sense that individuals that have one blob of knowledge tend to attract and be attracted to individuals with similar orientations and shapes in their blobs of knowledge, much like how magnetic dipoles align in a magnet. As humans, we tend to want to minimize our cognitive dissonance and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals is the easiest way to do that.</p><p>Individuals in these clusters experience a sort of echo chamber effect whereby the <em>magnitude</em> of their knowledge is amplified through the mutual alignment of their knowledge. However, this also poses a unique challenge where movement only happens in one direction and there is little to no room to deviate from that direction and try something new; something incredibly dangerous for innovation. This, in a sense, is turning collaborative thinking into groupthink.</p><blockquote><p>People afraid of losing their truth tend to be more violent than people who are used to looking at the world from several different viewpoints.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://blog.jzhao.xyz/img/spikes.png" alt="Broadening our base fundamental knowledge. Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge"><em>Blue: Previous ‘specialized’ knowledge. Purple: broad foundational knowledge</em></p><p>What we can do to counteract this extreme alignment is to build a broader foundation of knowledge. When you come across an individual with differing views, hopefully you will at least have the base fundamental knowledge to understand their perspective.</p><h2 id="learning-communities">Learning communities</h2><p>This, at least in part, is why I’ve recently become more certain of wanting to go to grad school in the future. I used to have tunnel-vision in thinking that all I wanted to do in the future was to just work in industry CS. Recently, I’ve started to realize that CS not a single discipline, but rather it’s a tool that can help solve uniquely human problems, and these human problems are inherently multidisciplinary.</p><p>I’ve started to read and learn more about the world around me outside of my little bubble of CS-related topics and it’s been eye-opening to see issues I read about in my philosophy class come up in a linguistics lecture which in turn comes up in a book I’m reading. I’ve found that the best way for me to cement my learning and understanding is through discussion with people, rather than just sitting and ruminating on my own – a very different pace than the typical <em>code-Stackoverflow-copy-repeat</em> self-learning cycle that most programmers (including myself) are familiar with.</p><p>The important part of learning communities like colleges is not necessarily the alignment in what you’re studying, but rather in the shared mindset of discussion, learning, and understanding. To broaden my foundation of knowledge is to read more about the opinions and findings of others and to critically discuss these among peers who may have different views. If we want our specialized knowledge to be applicable in a wide range of situations, we need a broad foundational base that can support that.</p><h2 id="wiggle-room">Wiggle room</h2><blockquote><p>If you want to go deeply into any subject, you need a lot of time, and in particular, you need the privilege of wasting time. You need to experiment with unproductive paths, explore dead ends, make space for doubts and boredom, and allow little seeds of insight to slowly grow and blossom</p></blockquote><p>For me, learning is very close to a zero-sum game. I can only expand the area of my knowledge blob so fast. If I want to broaden my foundational knowledge base, I need to reign in the amount of time spent growing purely technical strengths and to stop saying ‘yes’ to any and every opportunity that comes up.</p><p>Slowly but surely, I’m learning to value my own time and to set it aside to just absorb more about the world and to extend the reaches of my knowledge just a little bit further. To dilly-dally among the Wikipedia rabbit holes and faff among the ridiculously long list of side projects I planned to start. I’m experimenting with what I previously thought were deadends and little seeds of insight are starting to grow. Maybe I’ll find something interesting to share among the construction of this broader foundation.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>A big thank yu to <a href="https://twitter.com/ansonyuu">Anson</a> for always being a sounding board for fresh dough (half-baked ideas would be too generous of a description for these).

This component enables Apple to carry over many popular iOS features which require extra hardware security like Touch ID and Apple Pay to the Mac.</p><p id="4f7b">One of the lesser-known features of the Secure Enclave is that it performs automatic hardware based encryption of a Mac’s built-in SSD. This means that without any user intervention, your new Mac is encrypted right out of the packaging. With this fact in mind, you may be wondering if taking the extra step of enabling FileVault is still necessary? I am here to tell you, <strong>yes, it is absolutely </strong>necessary<strong>.</strong></p><p id="c7b9">An encrypted Mac without FileVault allows anyone who has physical access to your device to trivially read your personal data. They don’t even need to know your password. Even worse, some tools used to detect FileVault’s status (like <a href="http://osquery.io/" rel="noopener">osquery</a>), can conflate the differences between <strong>Encrypted</strong> versus <strong>FileVault On</strong> causing you to believe the data on your Mac is safe, when in fact, it’s unprotected from the most common scenarios wherein we rely on encryption to save us.</p><p id="6c62">In this article we will review the current situation, the steps you should take to ensure you are correctly polling this information, and how we are patching osquery to resolve this confusion.</p><ul><li id="5e11">The osquery <code>disk_encryption</code> table as of December 20th, 2020, reports a value of <code>encrypted = 1</code> for <strong>all T2 and M1 Macs</strong>, <em>regardless of the FileVault status</em>. This information is technically correct, but has likely resulted in inaccurate interpretations about FileVault’s status.</li><li id="138f">Kolide determined that the SSD of Encrypted Macs without FileVault can be trivially accessed with simple physical access to the device.</li><li id="df8d">Kolide <a href="https://github.com/kolide/launcher/pull/686" rel="noopener">shipped a hotfix for its own customers</a> with a new launcher table <code>kolide_filevault_status</code>, and amended its Check to address the issue.</li><li id="ce2e">Kolide <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6823" rel="noopener">shipped a patch for the osquery</a> <code>disk_encryption</code> table to include a new column: <code>filevault_status</code></li></ul><p id="0577">For 30 years, Apple has included a tool with its operating systems called ‘Target Disk Mode’. This utility allowed a user to mount the disk of one Apple device, on another device as a network volume. There are a variety of reasons this functionality is helpful, the most common being, the retrieval of data on a Mac that no longer boots successfully.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7944/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png" width="3972" height="2130" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Wj0OSxfGZSjBylDsV7W3tA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Apple’s built in Target Disk Mode makes it stupid easy to dump the entire contents of an “encrypted” Mac that doesn’t have FileVault enabled</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8058">However, using macOS’s Target Disk Mode an attacker with physical access to a device can trivially access the contents of the disk by physically connecting it to another computer and booting it in Recovery Mode.

With this new Secure Enclave CPU, Apple moved from a pattern of software encryption (FileVault2) to automatic hardware encryption. In 2020, on the newly introduced Apple Silicon Macs, a similar Secure Enclave is built right into the M1 SoC.</p><p id="24db">Both the T2 and the M1 Secure Enclave securely store a 256-bit AES key (UID) which cannot be directly accessed and is burnt into the chip, protecting both the SSD’s data and the TouchID sensor’s stored fingerprints, as well as disabling the device’s camera and microphone when the computer is locked.</p><p id="fe41">What this means in practice, is that the data on a Mac’s disk cannot be accessed once the disk is physically separated from the Mac or if the underlying encryption key is lost. In fact, if your Secure Enclave is damaged or wiped, this encryption will prevent you from accessing any of the contents of the drive. This is yet another failure mode one must negate with backups (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/mac-help/mh11421/11.0/mac/11.0" rel="noopener">which come with their own encryption considerations</a>)</p><p id="74e6">Before the introduction of the T2 security chip, disk encryption was synonymous with FileVault configuration on macOS. However, with hardware encryption this distinction became multi-faceted. This nuance was particularly problematic for security agents that did not differentiate between a disk that was ‘encrypted’ and a device that had FileVault configured.</p><p id="b412">Unfortunately, osquery fell into that camp, and its <code>disk_encryption</code> table simply returned a boolean value for the column <code>encrypted</code>, leading many to draw an erroneous conclusion causing a false sense of security.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1" width="1600" height="1029" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*1t7if31l-fcAGmX1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Osquery conflates the differences between FileVault and Encryption in its `disk_encryption` virtual table leading to False Negatives</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="8637">This issue was discovered when the output of common macOS terminal utilities (<code>diskutil apfs list</code> and <code>fdesetup status</code>) returned different information from what was observed when querying devices using osquery.</p><p id="c10b">This issue proved initially difficult to track down, due to the false-negative nature. It is often easier to track down a coding issue producing a false-positive but an intermittent false negative can be truly maddening. Because users are encouraged during setup to configure FileVault on new devices it is uncommon to see devices without it, this coupled with the fact that the table worked as expected on older hardware, led to a difficulty in establishing a pattern and subsequently a lag-time in discovery.</p><p id="1e06">Fortunately with some additional reverse engineering of Kolide <a href="https://github.com/kolide/launcher/pull/686" rel="noopener">updated its own agent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/6823" rel="noopener">Osquery itself</a> to report this data accurately. At the time of this writing the Osquery core-team has not issued an official release containing this fix, but building the agent yourself should net the new column you need.</p><p id="d7e3">Since publishing this article, I have gotten some feedback suggesting I am making a mountain out of a molehill.

  <section>
    <p>One of the biggest disadvantages of static site generators is that
they are static and can’t include comments.</p>
<p>There are multiples solutions to solve this problem. You could add
a third party blog engine like Disqus, but this has the drawback
of including a third-party tool with a bad privacy record in your
website. Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative
but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden. Having
to host a database was something we wanted to avoid with a
static site generator.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a better solution is to leverage the Mastodon and
Fediverse platform. Mastodon is a decentralized social network
and it allows people to communicate with each other without
being on the same server. It is inspired by Twitter, but instead
of tweeting, you write toot.</p>
<p>When publishing an article, you now only need to also write a
simple toot linking to your article. Then Mastodon has a simple
API to fetch the answer to your toot. This is the code I made for
my Hugo powered blog, but it is easily adaptable for other static
site generators. It will create a button to load comments instead
of loading them for every visitor so that it decreases the load on your
mastodon server.</p>

        <div><p>A <span><a title="Longitudinal Study into Violent Video Games" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2020.0049">ten-year longitudinal study</a></span>&nbsp;published in the Journal of <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</em> on a group in early adolescence from as young as ten years old, investigated how playing violent video games at an early age would translate into adulthood behavior (23 years of age). Titled "Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents" the study found no correlation between growing up playing video games and increased levels of aggression ten years later.</p><p>This particular study utilized a more contemporary approach for analyzing its data, known as the person-centered approach. Traditional studies use a variable-centered approach whereby researchers treat each variable, or characteristic, as related to another variable. An example would be that exercising is related to a reduced incidence of heart disease. This has been particularly valuable when comparing groups. In a person-centered approach researchers combine various algorithms across variables to determine how these variables compare among individuals. This approach provides a more accurate depiction of how variables relate to the individual.</p><p>As such, this study “accounts for heterogeneity, grouping individuals who are similar and who share a set of characteristics that vary similarly over time.” Participant families were recruited through “a large north-western city” beginning in 2007 (Wave 1) via telephone directories and required to complete questionnaires. 65% were Caucasian, 12% black and 19% multi-ethnic, 4% other. Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add to and diversify the sample group.</p><p>Video game violence ratings were assessed through the Common Sense Media, known to be a viable rating body for media. Participants were assessed through various behavioral characteristics such as aggression, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Results showed that boys played more violent video games than girls. Groups displayed three forms of video game play, according to the study: high-initial violence (4%) which indicated individuals played a high-level of violent video games at an early age, moderate initial violence (23%) whereby violent video game play was moderate at an early age, and low initial violence (73%).</p><p>The study concluded that group with low initial violence “was no higher in aggressive behavior than the high initial violence group at the final time point.” Therefore, it is determined that adolescents who played a high-level of violent video games at an early age did not show more aggressive behavior later in life than those who played fewer to no hours of violent video games at an early age.</p></div>

<p>If you are looking at Raspberry Pi alternatives in 2021 there is a range of options at various specifications and prices. Although at the time of writing some of these options are yet to be released I believe that they will be relevant within the next few months. </p>



<p>Raspberry Pi alternatives have always been an interest to me as they often create innovating products before the Raspberry Pi foundation. This is not to say I have anything against Raspberry Pi’s they are absolutely the well deserved leader in this market and still offer the best support and community. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Jetons or counters were used as calculation instruments in
Europe in the middle ages. According to medieval taste, they
were always decorated. These decorations always had a
purpose, sometimes religious, but usually related to the user or the
principal. In the 16th century, jetons were mostly used to
propagate political messages and to glorify the deeds of the ruler.
There was such a great need to make propaganda through jetons
that they continued to be struck long after jetons ceased to be used
as counters. In France and in the Netherlands this new image of
the jeton began about the end of the 16th century. The jeton
became a small commemorative medal only suitable as a collectors
item. The development in Germany was slightly different.
In the course of the 17th century the counters became smaller
and smaller, for little by little they were only used as chips for
card-playing. Real jetons are metallic thin flat discs and are
struck like coins. The differences from coins are: the metal is
generally copper or brass and seldom silver. Gold jetons are very
rare. The measure is always between ca. 20 mm and ca. 28 mm.
Smaller or larger pieces cannot be used as reckoning counters.
The relief is always low for easy pushing and making piles. (In
France the jetons were mostly laid down overlapping, as shown
in the figure). Jetons are not coins, so they never have an indication
of value.
</p><p>
The copper jeton shown in
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet1.jpg">Figure 1</a>
is a good example of a
reckoning counter of the Low Countries of the 16th century. The
type on the obverse is heraldic. The legend gives the name and
the title of the principal of this jeton, Maximilian of Bergen op
Zoom, bishop of Cambray (now in France). The legend of the
reverse is the motto of the bishop: "neither quick nor rash,"
which is symbolized by a beautiful clock. The jeton is dated as
usual in this period.
</p><p>
In ancient times the Greeks and Romans mostly used pebbles or
bone disks for their calculations. This was cheaper than a
beadframe, although we know that the Romans also used abaci.
Usually the pebbles were half bulb-shaped pieces of limestone.
The Romans called them "calculi" (singular: calculus =
limestone, pebble), the origin of our word "calculation." In
counting the pebbles were pushed over a counter-board with
lines. The counter-board was used in the same way as the
counter-frame.
</p><p>
Calculating with jetons was always accompanied by registering
the numbers in Roman figures.
</p><p>
There were no strict rules for higher numbers. XXVIII.CCCCXXXII
and XXVIII<sup>m</sup>IIII<sup>c</sup>XXXII were both possible for 28,432.
Abbreviations as MCM for 1900 were not usual in the middle-ages.
</p><p>
After the fall of the Roman Empire, international trade was
reduced, therefore the need of calculating became less.
However, thanks to churches and convents which had to figure
out the dates of the changing church festivals, calculating with
jetons had not been forgotten and the revival of trade in
Northern Italy and France in the 12th and 13th centuries made it
necessary again. In the meantime in Western Europe the
beadframe abacus had definitely made room for the jetons which
were exclusively made of metal and usually, just like coins,
struck in copper and brass.
</p><p>
The calculating took place on a board with lines.
Counter-boards with inlaid lines have been kept through the ages in
private collections or museums. A cloth with embroidered lines
was used very incidentally (for example at the yearly verification
of the city-accounts) because of the quick wear and tear.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet2.gif">Figure 2</a>
is a woodcut from Gregor Reisch's <em>Margarita
Philosophica</em>, Freiburg, 1503, an early German book about
arithmetic. Here "Arithmetica" is symbolized by a woman
holding two books with the two different ways of calculation.
The mathematician Pythagoras is shown calculating with jetons
on a counter-table, while the philosopher Boethius is ciphering
with Arabic figures.
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jeta.gif">Figure a</a>
shows a counter-board with the
figure 123. The cross at the fourth line, or thousand-line, was
intended to help the eye like the comma that marks off the
thousands in Arabic figures.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet3.jpg">Figure 3</a>
shows the same figure 123 on a reckoning-cloth,
made by the wife of the author.
</p><p>
In the course of the 13th century scientists of Western
Europe gradually learned how to make use of Arabic figures and
discovered the meaning of the figure zero (= an empty space on
the counter-board). Now also the Christian world knew how to
make calculations by pen-reckoning and the abacus and Roman
figures were no longer needed. It still took a few centuries before
everyone at school learned how to pen-reckon. Invention of the
printing-press quickened this process. Printed arithmetic books
reached many more people than had ever been possible through
oral instructions. Below are some examples of calculating with
jetons or counters. Here is dealt with only the most simple form
of plain calculation. Other systems were used for money-counting.
</p><div>
Put the figures down, separated by the vertical line.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetb.gif">figure b</a>)
<p>
Actually we already have the answer, but after simplification
the result is shown much clearer: Remove 5 counters from
the bottom line and put instead a counter in the V-space between
the I-line and the X-line. This one together with the counter
already being in the V-space are replaced by one counter on the
X-line. Now we have five counters on the X-line which we
replace by one in the L-space. (If you cannot see through
anymore there is only one solution: Draw a few lines on a piece
of paper and do the addition yourself with a few dimes or
something like it.) Finally we replace the two L-counters by one
on the C-line and we see the number CCCI or 301.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetc.gif">figure c</a>)
</p><p>
Subtraction is done in the same way.
</p><center>
<h2>
MULTIPLICATION
</h2>
</center>
<p>
It is more difficult to multiply and divide. Yet the operations
on the counter-board are easier to understand than
pen-reckoning. Example: CCLXXXV x XXIII (285 x 23 = )
Put down both figures
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet5.jpg">Figure 5</a>).
</p><p>
First we multiply 285 by 10. In Arabic figures a zero is added
to 285: 285 x 10 = 2850. On the counter-board it is as easy. Push
all the counters one line up
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet6.jpg">Figure 6</a>,
right).
Double this result, which makes the multiplication 20 times
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet7.jpg">Figure 7</a>).
First simplify. To indicate that we have multiplied by 20,
we remove the 2 X-counters from 23.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet8.jpg">Figure 8</a>).
</p><p>
Multiplying by 3 is done the easiest on the left side of the
board. 3 x 285 is carried out as 3 x 200 + 3 x 80 + 3 x 5
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet9.jpg">Figure 9</a>).
</p><p>
Finally the two figures are joined, see
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet10.jpg">Figure 10</a>,
and simplified
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet11.jpg">Figure 11</a>).
</p><p>
You may verify the result with pen-reckoning or calculator
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet12.jpg">Figure 12</a>).
</p><center>
<h2>
DIVISION
</h2>
</center>
<p>
The arithmetic book of Robert Recorde, <em>The Grounds of
Artes Teaching the Worke and Practice of Arithmetik</em>, first
published in 1542 in London, provides us with the last example. This
book contains not only the teaching of pen-reckoning but also
how the old method with counters could be used together with
the new Arabic figures. "If 225 sheepe cost 45&nbsp;£, what did
each sheep cost? To know this, I should divide the whole
somme, that is 45&nbsp;£ by 225, but that cannot be: Therefore must I
first reduce that 45&nbsp;£ into a lesser denomination, as into shillings,
then I multiplie 45 by 20, and it is 900: these two numbers
therefore I set thus.
(<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jetd.gif">figure d</a>)
</p><p>
Then I begin at the highest line of the dividend, and seeke
how often I may have the divisor therein, and that I may doe
foure times..." The explanation that follows is not very clear.
Probably Recorde hasn't calculated with counters very often
himself. Division is explained only in a few of the arithmetic
books from the 16th century that I consulted.
</p><p>
According to those books the pupil had to do by heart all the
multiplications that were necessary for dividing; only subtraction
was done on the counter-board. We may say that dividing
was one of the least practised operations.
</p><p>
To understand by experience, I divided XXVIII.CCCCXXXII
by CCCVII (28,432 divided by 357). Including laying out the
necessary multiplications it took about 10 minutes before I
found out that the answer was LXXVIIII with a remainder of
CCXXVIIII. I needed 43 counters for this calculation. It seemed
sensible to do the verification by a calculator.
</p><p>
A trained reckoner could probably do it much faster,
although a counter-board was always slower than a bead-frame
abacus, for pushing is done more quickly than putting down and
taking away.
</p><p>
In his <em>The Japanese Abacus</em> (1954), Takashi Kojima describes
a contest between the Japanese abacus or soroban and the
electric calculating machine (not a modern electronic one!) which
was held in Tokyo on November 12, 1946 under the sponsorship
of the U.S. Army newspaper, the <em>Stars and Stripes</em>. In reporting
the contest, the <em>Stars and Stripes</em> remarked: "The machine age
took a step backward yesterday at the Ernie Pyle Theater as the
abacus, centuries old, dealt defeat to the most up-to-date electric
machine now being used by the United States government ...
The abacus victory was decisive."
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet13.jpg">Figure 13</a>
is a small modern Japanese soroban with bamboo
rods and with four beads on the lower section and one on the
upper. Each of the four beads on the lower section of a rod has the
value of 1, while the bead on the upper section of the rod has the
value of 5. Each of the 1-unit beads below the beam obtains its
value when it is moved up toward the beam, and loses its value
when it is moved back down. The 5-unit bead obtains its value
when it is moved down to the beam, etc. The soroban in the
illustration shows the figure 123.
</p><p>
One of the different systems of counting with jetons is shown in
<a href="http://www.chicagocoinclub.org/projects/PiN/jet14.jpg">Figure 14</a>.
This is the title page of Robrecht van
Heusden's <em>Reken-boechsken</em>, Antwerp, 16th century. At the far
left is laid down a column (vertical) of jetons, generally called the
"tree." The lowest marks the row of unit jetons, the next above
the ten jetons, and so on. The five jeton has to be placed in the
space between the lowest and the second jeton of the tree.

<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png"><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png" alt="Flow running on a Raspberry Pi 400" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>
