<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>Last time, we <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2020/12/13/shallow-trees-with-heavy-leaves/">briefly mentioned</a> the high-level differences between Stockfish and Leela Chess.</p>
<p>To recap, Stockfish evaluates about 100 million positions per second using rudimentary heuristics, whereas Leela Chess evaluates 40 000 positions per second using a deep neural network trained from millions of games of self-play. They also use different tree search approaches: Stockfish uses a variant of alpha-beta pruning, whereas Leela Chess uses Monte Carlo tree search.</p>
<p>An important recent change to Stockfish was to introduce a neural network to evaluate the positions in the search tree, instead of just relying on hardcoded heuristics. It’s still much simpler than Leela Chess’s neural network, and only slows down Stockfish to exploring 50 million positions per second.</p>
<p>The real cleverness of Stockfish’s neural network is that it’s an <strong>efficiently-updatable neural network (NNUE)</strong>. Specifically, it’s a simple feedforward network with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large (10.5M parameters!) input layer, illustrated below, that can utilise two different levels of sparsity for computational efficiency;</li>
<li>three much smaller layers (with 17.5k parameters in total) which are evaluated densely using vector instructions;</li>
<li>a single scalar output to give a numerical score for the position, indicating how favourable it is for the player about to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is done using integer arithmetic, with 16-bit weights in the first layer and 8-bit weights in the remaining layers.</p>
<h3>The input layer</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by studying the first — and most interesting — layer. Here’s an illustration I made using Wolfram Mathematica:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png" alt="" width="640" height="760" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial.png 640w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nnue-initial-253x300.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>The inputs to the layer are two sparse binary arrays, each consisting of 41024 elements. It may seem highly redundant to encode a chess position using 82048 binary features, but this is similar to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html">an approach</a> (called ‘feature crosses’) used in recommender systems.</p>
<p>What are the two sparse binary arrays, and why do they have 41024 features? My preferred way of interpreting these two arrays are as the ‘worldviews’ of the white king and the black king. In particular, the differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinate systems:</strong> because black and white pawns move in opposite directions, the two players need to ‘see the board from opposite angles’. This already happens in regular (human) chess because the two players are seated opposite each other at the chessboard, so one player’s ‘top’ is the other player’s ‘bottom’. If you imagine each player numbering the squares from top to bottom, left to right, then any physical square would be called <em>n</em> by one player and 63 − <em>n</em> by the other player.</li>
<li><strong>Piece types:</strong> instead of viewing the pieces as black or white, a player sees it as either ‘mine’ or ‘theirs’. The 10 non-king piece types are thus {my pawn, their pawn, my knight, their knight, my bishop, their bishop, my rook, their rook, my queen, their queen}.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these ‘player-relative coordinate systems’ is that it means that Stockfish can use the same neural network irrespective of whether it’s playing as white or black. The network uses <em>both</em> your king’s worldview and your enemy king’s worldview for evaluating a position, because they’re both highly relevant (you want to protect your own king and capture your enemy’s king).</p>
<p>So, why does each worldview have 41024 features? It can be seen as an outer product (or tensor product) of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 64-element feature encoding the position of the king whose worldview this is, in their own coordinate system. This is ‘one-hot encoding’, where exactly one of the 64 entries is ‘1’ and the other 63 entries are ‘0’.</li>
<li>a 641-element feature encoding, for each of the 64 × 10 ordered pairs (square, piece-type), whether or not that square is occupied by that piece. The 641st element is unused, and is (according to the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">Chess Programming Wiki</a>) apparently a result of the network being ported from Shogi to chess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the two 64-by-641 outer product matrices* is then flattened (the matrix is ‘reshaped’ into a vector with the same entries) to yield the corresponding 41024-element ‘sparse worldview’. In the input layer, each of the two 41024-element sparse worldviews are then affinely transformed to form a 256-element ‘dense worldview’.</p>
<p><strong>*Important note:</strong> the 41024-element sparse binary arrays are never explicitly materialised, either as a 64-by-641 matrix or as a 41024-element vector. The Stockfish NNUE effectively ‘fuses’ the construction of these sparse vectors with the subsequent affine transformation (described below), updating the 256-element dense worldviews directly when the configuration of pieces on the chessboard is modified.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two levels of sparsity</strong> which are utilised when computing this affine transformation from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B41024%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{41024}" title="\mathbb{R}^{41024}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7B256%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{R}^{256}" title="\mathbb{R}^{256}">, allowing the network to be efficiently evaluated many times in a tree search:</p>
<ul>
<li>the 41024-element implicit vectors are themselves sparse: the number of nonzero elements is equal to the number of non-king pieces on the board.</li>
<li>moving a piece typically changes very few of the entries of the vector: if it’s a regular non-king move, only 2 entries change; if it’s a non-king move with capture, then 3 entries change.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this second aspect which warrants the name ‘efficiently updatable’: when a move is made (or unmade, since we’re doing a tree search), we only need to add/subtract a few 256-element matrix columns from the resulting ‘dense worldview’ to update it.</p>
<p>Unless a king is moved, this (2 or 3 vector additions/subtractions) beats summing all of the matrix columns corresponding to nonzero entries (up to 30 vector additions), which in turn unconditionally beats doing a regular dense matrix-vector multiplication (41024 vector additions). That is to say, the second-level sparsity is about 10 times more efficient than the first-level sparsity, which is in turn about 1000 times more efficient than naively doing a dense matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
<p>The two dense worldviews are concatenated according to which player is about to move, producing a 512-element vector, which is elementwise clamped to [0, 127]. This elementwise clamping is the nonlinear activation function of the input layer, and (as we’ll describe) the hidden layers use a similar activation function. We can think of this as a ‘clipped ReLU’, which is <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/nnue/layers/clipped_relu.h">exactly what the Stockfish source code calls it</a>.</p>
<h3>The remaining layers</h3>
<p>The two hidden layers each use 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases. The activation function first divides the resulting 32-bit integer by 64 before again clamping to [0, 127], ready to be fed into the next layer. The output layer also uses 8-bit weights and 32-bit biases, but with no nonlinear activation function.</p>
<p>The first hidden layer takes 512 inputs (the clamped concatenated worldviews) and produces 32 outputs. The second hidden layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and again produces 32 outputs. The output layer takes those 32 values as inputs, and produces a single scalar output.</p>
<p>Since these subsequent layers are applied to dense vectors, they can’t use the same ‘efficiently updatable’ approach as the input layer; that’s why they’re necessarily substantially smaller. They can, however, use hardware vectorisation instructions (SSE/AVX) to apply the linear transformation and activation function.</p>
<p>This scalar output is then <a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=75506&amp;start=9">further postprocessed</a> using other Stockfish heuristics, including taking into account the 50-move rule which isn’t otherwise incorporated into the evaluation function.</p>
<p>Observe that the neural network doesn’t actually have complete information, such as whether a pawn has just moved two squares (relevant to <em>en passant</em>), whether a king is able to castle, and various other information pertaining to the rather complicated rules for determining a draw. This is okay: the network is only being used as a cheap approximate evaluation for a position; when deciding what move to make, Stockfish performs a very deep tree search and only uses this approximate evaluation in the leaves.</p>
<p>Equivalently, you can think of this as being a massive refinement of the approach of ‘look a few moves ahead and see whether either player gains a material or positional advantage’, using a neural network as a much more sophisticated position-aware alternative of crudely ‘counting material’.</p>
<p>This is a neural network, so the weight matrices and bias vectors of the layers were learned by training the network on millions of positions and using backpropagation and a gradient-based optimiser. Of course, for supervised learning, you need a ‘ground truth’ for the network to attempt to learn, which seems somewhat circular: how do you even gather training data? The answer is that you use the classical version of Stockfish to evaluate positions <strong>using the deep tree search</strong>, and use that as your training data.</p>
<p>In theory, you could then train another copy of the NNUE using the NNUE-enhanced Stockfish as the evaluation function, and then iterate this process. Leela Chess does the same thing: its current network is trained on positions evaluated by using deep lookahead with the previous network as the leaf evaluation function. Note that the construction of the training data is orders of magnitude more expensive than training the network with this data, as you’re doing thousands of evaluations of the previous network (owing to the deep tree search) to construct each item of training data for the new network.</p>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>The network is <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE">described and illustrated</a> on the Chess Programming Wiki, which also has tonnes of references to forum discussions and other references. The first description of an NNUE was a Japanese paper by Yu Nasu (who suggested it for the board game Shogi instead of chess); the paper has <a href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue">since been translated</a> into English and German. There’s also the Stockfish source code, which is very well organised (there’s <a href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src/nnue">a directory</a> for the NNUE) and clearly written.</p>

<p>Interestingly, public materials about the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">Drawbridge</a> variant used on SQL Server are few and far between.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://threedots.ovh/slides/Drawbridge.pdf">here</a> is a slide deck about me working with Drawbridge from several years back. I’ve updated parts of it later on, keeping up partially with more recent SQLPAL versions.</p>



<p>Since I made that slide deck, lots of things happened… which will maybe be a subject for a story or two some day.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I have seen a significant uptick of people posting or joining the forums and using belligerent language, making unilateral demands and insulting the process that is open source software. “The fact you haven’t done x is stupid”. “How can you write a piece of software that doesn’t do y?”. “It’s 2021 and you still can’t make a program do z, how pathetic”. Not exact words, but accurate sentiments.</p>
<p>Please don’t do this. Please be nice.</p>
<p>The Signal team, as with any open-source team, are not infinite resources to pour down the drain. Every hour they spend on their job working for Signal, every hour they spend after work helping out, every hour a volunteer puts into forum support and bug investigation, is an hour consumed. To receive insults and vitriol in return is corrosive. It is unfair and it is not in the spirit of giving, of making something and offering it for free.</p>
<p>You’re receiving this for free, this great software which is made by people who <em>literally care</em> about your privacy. They don’t know you, and they sure don’t know what you talk about on Signal, and yet they put in a lot of effort for this. Not to make wads of cash. Not to sell you to advertisers for your social life to be analysed and abused.</p>
<p>The developer for the Mastodon software Fedilab recently <a href="https://framagit.org/tom79/fedilab/-/issues/498" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">revealed he has been burnt out</a> and I’ve read elsewhere it was because people were screaming hate at him for a principle he upheld - which was that his software would not censor people screaming hate at each other. I’m sure you can appreciate the painful irony here. (Please note that his stepping down seems to be for real, the specific reasons I’ve gave are speculation). I, for one, chose his software specifically because it did not censor, because whilst I believe a service can censor if it chooses, software must remain neutral. (If you wish to discuss this, perhaps let’s do that on another thread).</p>
<p>Don’t be that person. Don’t jump on issues making demands. Don’t pile on forum threads that make some users’ opinions very clear as it is, and throw your bellicose howling in there too. Don’t insult the developers or their priorities, their choices. They are real people who have a finite capacity for work and for abuse. Add a thumbs up to an issue, add a heart to a forum request. Post only if you can materially add to the discussion, else use a reaction. Post in the spirit and the letter of the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/guidelines">community guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Please be nice.</p>

<p>This is not cool, and you have kind of missed the point entirely.</p>
<p>As the post says, the people behind the non-profit app are spending time out of their days to help everyone get the best out of the app. Of late, with the influx of users requesting (and demanding!) features akin to WhatsApp and the other monstrosities, it’s likely to take its toll.</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying, to a degree. I also don’t think your post should be ‘hidden’ as it’s been reported by the Cancel-Culture-Community. I firmly believe that if you say something, you own that! As you will expect, people are entitled to reply to that to support or rebut. That’s called a conversation. So you shouldn’t be denied that. That said, the Community Guidelines are what they are. And if we disagree, we can chose not to participate.</p>
<p>In summary, the bottom line is being aware of the unkindness towards those trying to help. Berating developers for not having something featured isn’t likely to inspire ‘will’. Neither is your post. But then you have every right to say what you have said and others have the right to reply to it accordingly. In my opinion, anyway.</p>

          <p>Firstly. Thank you to Signal Devs. I think you’re all doing an amazing job and I will be signing up to donate, even if it is a small amount.</p>
<p>One thing I want to say to the Signal Dev Team. I bet that 99% of your user base appreciate all the hard work you are doing and want to support you in any way they can, myself included, even if just morally. Please don’t let that 1% of intolerant users discourage you from all the great input you have.</p>
<p>I am a great supporter of free speech even if something is “offensive” but posters must also realize the difference between <strong>“saying something offensive”</strong> and <strong>"hate speech"</strong></p>

<p>You might have the right to say what you want, but free speech isn’t about interrupting a conversation about football yelling about zebras. Free speech is about tolerance, about a productive and focused conversation –that’s why there’re guidelines, and why guidelines are there to be tolerated.</p>

<p>I was one of the flaggers. I am fine with someone disagreeing with me and refuting or rebutting what I’ve said. I even tolerate them doing so rudely if their points are salient. (A few hours later I usually come back and +1 their post with begrudging flouncing) If their first post on a forum is flaming someone without addressing a single one of their points in a coherent or sensible way, misrepresenting the letter and spirit of the conversation and acting generally in bad-faith, then I will flag that as it’s not a conversation, it’s just pointless screaming. If they also break the rules then they’re definitely getting a flag.</p>
<p>Flagging/reporting a post is not cancel culture at all. Flagging a rude, abusive or entirely unconstructive post is doing your bit as a member of the community to weed out bad behaviour and bad actors. I urge everyone to flag anyone posting in bad faith, or breaking the rules. Flag it all and let the pages written by people who detract from the conversation burn.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The Mac has always been very different from its close relative, iOS, especially when it comes to what a user is or is not allowed to run on their system. Even with the introduction of Apple Silicon, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/?t=1161">has made it very clear</a> that the Mac is still the Mac, and is still <em>hackable</em>, even when running on the new architecture.</p><p>What this means for us developers is that, when targeting the Mac platform, we have choices: we can distribute our apps independently, outside the Mac App Store, through the Mac App Store exclusively, or through both at the same time.</p><p>This article is my brain dump on the subject. It is meant to be a guide on the things that you’ll need to know about when distributing a Mac app outside the App Store, rather than a how-to tutorial. My hope is that having everything listed here will help demystify the process for beginners, and the descriptions of my own process will be useful as starting points.</p><h2>App Store x Direct: pros and cons</h2><p>All of these choices come with their pros and cons, and depending on which type of Mac app you’re making, you might not be able to have it in the Mac App Store to begin with. An example of that is my app <a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/">AirBuddy</a> which, in order to provide deep integration with Apple’s wireless devices, needs to run a system agent and use some private APIs, which would never be allowed in the App Store. The same goes for many other types of apps which simply wouldn’t work with the restrictions of the Mac’s sandbox.</p><p>For those who do have that choice, I’ve compiled a list of what I believe to be the pros and cons between shipping through the Mac App Store or shipping directly.</p><h3>Mac App Store pros</h3><ul><li>Apple handles the distribution, billing and licensing for you</li><li>The app is easier to find and install for most users</li><li>Potential to get featured by Apple and reach more customers</li><li>Can use features such as Sign in With Apple which are not available for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store</li></ul><h3>Mac App Store cons</h3><ul><li>Have to pay a 15% or 30% cut of all sales to Apple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">depending on how much you make in a year across all apps</a></li><li>Every single update, no matter how minor, has to go through App Review and has the potential of being rejected for arbitrary and random reasons</li><li>Can’t unlock the full potential of macOS because of the strict sandboxing requirements</li><li>Can’t do paid upgrades</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution pros</h3><ul><li>Ship updates whenever you want, no need to wait for them to be reviewed and no fear of random rejections</li><li>Unlock the full potential of macOS with system extensions, daemons, no sandboxing, private API, and more</li><li>Keep a higher percentage of your sales</li><li>Do paid upgrades or other business models which are not allowed in the App Store</li><li>Live without the constant fear that your app will suddenly become a problem for Apple and be threatened with removal from the App Store</li></ul><h3>Direct distribution cons</h3><ul><li>Have to handle licensing, distribution, and updates (it’s not that hard, you’ll see)</li><li>Not as easy to do consumable or non-consumable in-app purchases (no StoreKit)</li><li>Can’t use some Apple services such as Sign in With Apple (others such as CloudKit still work just fine)</li></ul><h2>A note on Catalyst and SwiftUI</h2><p>With the introduction of Catalyst, we’re now seeing many new Mac apps being released, since it’s a lot easier to take an existing iPad app and turn it into a Mac app. Apps ported to macOS through Catalyst are not required to be released in the App Store, even if their counterpart on iOS is.</p><p>Additionally, there is currently no TestFlight for macOS (one of my wishes for 2021), so if you’d like to distribute beta builds of a Catalyst app, you’ll have to do that outside the Mac App Store, and it is not that different from distributing a production app.</p><p>A lot of what I’m presenting here will also apply for Catalyst apps — they’re Mac apps, after all — but some might require additional hacking in order to work around the fact that Apple doesn’t want you to use the entirety of AppKit directly from within a Catalyst app. With a bit of work though, you can make a Catalyst app very Mac-capable, including <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">support for AppleScript</a> and other features.</p><p>For SwiftUI apps targeting the Mac, there should be no major differences with the distribution process, since you can use all features of the macOS API in a SwiftUI app without requiring a lot of hacking like it does for Catalyst apps.</p><h2>Distribution</h2><p>Distribution of an app involves two parts: actually uploading, storing and serving the app binary and its updates somewhere, and also producing the right package that will work for your users.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The first major step with getting your Mac app in the hands of users without the App Store is to figure out how to distribute its binary. No App Store means that you’ll have to host your app’s binaries and updates somewhere on the internet and provide a link for your users to download it.</p><p>There are several ways you can go about this. For an open-source app, you can use Github releases and even host your app’s update feed in the Github repo. That’s how I distribute the <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC/releases">WWDC app for macOS</a>.</p><p>For my commercial apps, I’ve been using <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze B2</a> for storage of both the app binaries, delta updates and update feed, and proxying all requests through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> so that I can have a custom domain for the downloads/updates and also add filtering, caching and logic on the server if needed.</p><p>B2 is an extremely affordable provider (I rarely pay over US$1 in a month). Most Mac apps are not that large in size, so even if your app is downloaded a lot, it’s unlikely that you’ll end up having to pay a lot of money for storage/bandwidth. Another popular option is using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> buckets, but their control panel gives me nightmares so I prefer to use B2 which is a lot simpler (and less expensive).</p><p>I haven’t automated the publishing step for my app releases as of yet, so to upload a new release I just use <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> as a client for my B2 buckets. Speaking of that, before we even get to upload a release to whatever provider we’ve chosen, there’s a very important step: getting the right file to put out there.</p><h3>Notarization and packaging</h3><p>When exporting an archived app from within Xcode, we get two main options for distribution: App Store Connect and Developer ID. To distribute apps without the App Store, you’re going to be using Developer ID.</p><p>The same developer account you use for distributing apps to the Mac App Store can be used to sign your apps for Developer ID distribution. The certificate itself is different, but Xcode will auto-generate and install one for you during the process of exporting the archive if you haven’t done so yet.</p><p>Since macOS Catalina, all apps distributed directly to users must be notarized by Apple, otherwise they won’t launch by default. This process uploads your app to Apple, which will then run automated malware checks and “staple” your binary with a special signature that will allow it to run. This is not App Review, it’s an automated check to prevent malware from being distributed through this method, and it is also a way for Apple to flag a single binary for malware, instead of a developer’s entire account, should it become compromised at some point.</p><p>Whether or not you notarize the binary directly from within the Xcode organizer will depend on which packaging method you’ll be using to distribute your app. We can’t just upload a <code>.app</code> directory to a server and let users download that, we have to turn it into a flat file. The simple way to do that is to just zip the app and distribute it as a zip file, but I’ve found through experience that distributing the app as a DMG file reduces support requests by quite a bit.</p><p>You’ve probably seen DMGs before when downloading Mac apps. They’re disk images that are mounted by macOS when double-clicked in Finder, and they can also provide some artwork instructing the user to drag the app into their Applications folder. This makes it easy for a user to figure out what to do, and it also reduces the chances that a given user will be running your app from their Downloads folder or some other random place like that.</p><p>If you’re going to be distributing your app as a DMG, you should just export it using the Developer ID option in Xcode, without notarization, then notarize the DMG itself. There’s no option in Xcode to export a DMG, so you’ll have to use a third-party tool. The one I like to use is <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg">create-dmg</a>. I’ve also created and open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/insidegui/dmgdist">dmgdist</a>, a tool that automates the process of creating, uploading and stapling the DMG so that you can get the image ready to be distributed by running a single command.</p><p>To distribute the app as a zip file, the process is simpler: pick the upload option from Xcode after selecting “Developer ID” and it’ll produce a notarized version of your app, which you can then zip up and distribute directly.</p><h2>App updates</h2><p>Another aspect of the App Store is that it also handles app updates. Whenever we upload a new version to App Store Connect and it gets approved, users receive the update in the App Store. For apps distributed directly, we need to replicate that somehow.</p><p>The best way to do that — and the most common — is to use <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a>. It’s been around for many many years and is pretty much the official way to distribute updates for Mac apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.</p><p>Sparkle is currently living a double life of sorts. You can either use the “legacy” version of Sparkle or use a more modern “v2” branch which includes many improvements such as the ability to update sandboxed apps. I still use the “legacy” version because it’s the one that I’m familiar with and I find that integrating the more modern version is still a bit more complicated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>The process of generating an app update usually goes as follows: ensure that with every update you increase the app’s version (of course), produce the package as described before (Sparkle can handle zips, DMGs and installer packages), then use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool to update the feed. After doing that, upload the deltas, the package for the new version, and the updated AppCast …</p></div></article></div>

										<span>This is The Entire Computer Science Curriculum in 1000 YouTube Videos</span>
			
														
						
						<div>
				<p><span>In this article, we are going to create an entire Computer Science curriculum using only YouTube videos. The Computer Science curriculum is going to cover every skill essential for a Computer Science Engineer that has expertise in Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, like: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, etc.</span></p>
<p>The curriculum is going to be organized in 40 courses in total, further organized in 4 academic years, each containing 2 semesters.</p>
<p>We are going to try to list a few videos per course as we can, so we can keep the list short.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to capture the whole university experience in perspective of the organization of the courses and deliver you the whole curriculum for FREE, so you can gain significant knowledge.</p>
<p>We know that this is not the same as you’ll get at university, but the videos are of high quality, and most of them helped us, during our time at university.</p>
<p>We hope you will like it, and it will be of use to you.</p>
<p>As of today, we’ve seen that most of the visitors on our website, like the articles where we talk about free courses, curriculums, books, etc. Some of our most popular articles in that area are:</p>

<h2><strong>Whole Computer Science Curriculum in 40 YouTube Videos</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Year 1: </strong><strong>Semester 1</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structured Programming (Programming in C)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to <a href="http://laconicml.com/machine-learning-weka/">programming</a>. It will help you write your first code, run your first application, and see what programming is about. You will start with printing messages on the screen, simple arithmetic operations, if-else statements, loops, data structures (arrays, matrices), memory addresses, pointers, reading and writing files, etc. You will build simple applications that will allow you to understand the material even better. The best two videos that we recommend for this course are:</p>

</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to declarative statements, sets, and operations with sets, laws, logic, quantifiers, functions, proofs, sequences, and summation. For this course, and it’s a second part which we’ve put in Year 2, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 YouTube videos, but we are going to split it, 34 videos for part 1 (1-34) and 26 videos for the part 2 (35-60).</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 1-34)</a></li>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 1</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to limits, intervals, differentiability, continuity, derivatives, antiderivatives, rules, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, optimizations, and sums. It will be a huge help to you, once you dive into the later semesters of your studies and will help you understand most of the <a href="http://laconicml.com/mathematical-skills-data-scientist/">mathematics</a> behind Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc. Here we will suggest you take look at this list of 86 videos. Yes, it looks long, but the videos are quite short and well explained.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1ml6mys-RXoQ0O3GfwBPVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 1 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to computer science and programming from a theoretical view. It is very important for every beginner to have a visual representation in its mind about most of the concepts of computer science and programming. That way, it can understand their complexity and unlock its imagination and creativity and use the full power of computer science and programming while respecting their laws. Here we recommend you this video:</p>
<div><iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-ezsrc="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOjov-2OZ0E"></iframe></div>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Intro to Python Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is an introduction to Python programming. Easily one of the most popular programming languages in the world, <a href="http://laconicml.com/implement-bayesian-regression-python/">Python</a> is widely used by many people who work in some sort of IT-related field. It is easy to understand, use has tons of libraries and it has huge community support. It is used in Web Development (Django, Flask), Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow), etc. You are going to use Python a lot, so for this course, we are going to keep it simple by recommending only one video:</p>
<div><iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-ezsrc="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfscVS0vtbw"></iframe></div>





<h2><strong>Semester 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Calculus part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the second part of the Calculus. Here you are going to learn about integrals, series, tests, polar coordinates, polar graphs, etc. For this course, we are going to recommend you this playlist of 64 videos. It looks like a lot, but the videos are well explained and are quite short, so you feel like you’ve covered a lot of material.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1OxI-BbNkEhuwPHcKxuPSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calculus part 2 playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Discrete Mathematics part 2</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce you to matrices, graphs, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithms complexity, introduction to probability, combinatorics, variations, and permutations.</p>
<p>This is the second part of the Discrete Mathematics, and as we’ve mentioned in the first part, we are going to use the same playlist of 60 videos, but here we are going to watch starting from the 35th up to the 60th video.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discrete Math playlist (videos: 35-60)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will introduce me to C++, starting from the basics, up to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is one of the main programming paradigms, and probably the most used.</p>
<p>Most of the applications that you have on your mobile phone or access from the browser are programmed following this paradigm.</p>
<p>It is the pillar of every program you will write in the future, so you will want to give this course more time. For this course, we will recommend you a video playlist of 29 videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend you to watch them up to the 13th because the rest of them are beyond OOP and if you are new to this, might be complex and difficult to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvQ9S8YSV0iDsuEU8v11yP9M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++ tutorial playlist (videos: 1-13)</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Computer System Architecture</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this course, you are going to be introduced to set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache and virtual memory organizations, protection and sharing, I/O and interrupts, in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, VLIW machines, vector supercomputers, multithreaded architectures, symmetric multiprocessors, and parallel computers. For this course, we will recommend you the following playlist coming from <a href="http://laconicml.com/computer-science-engineer-mit-university/">MIT</a>. The list has 39 videos, that are quite long</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3JCL1TWybTDtKq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Systems Architecture full playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Introduction to Web Design (HTML + CSS)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is your introduction to what one stage of web development (the front-end) looks like. You are going to get familiar with HTML, which is the markup language that makes the elements we see on a webpage, and with CSS, which is a stylesheet that gives life to those elements. Here we recommend two videos, one for HTML and one for CSS.</p>

<p>This course is one of the most important courses for every Computer Science Engineer who wants to be an expert in <a href="http://laconicml.com/free-artificial-intelligence-courses-by-google/">Machine Learning</a>. The course consists of intro to probability, combinatorics, variations, permutations, distributions, etc.</p>
<p>The playlist that we’ve recommended is from Khan’s Academy. It contains 41 videos that are 10 minutes long at max, and are very interesting, and contain tons of practical examples.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probability playlist</a></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Statistics</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the other most important courses if you want to do Machine Learning in the future. The course will get you familiar with the main statistical features, hypothesis testing, levels of measurements, etc. The playlist that we recommend contains 28 videos, which are quite long.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5102DFDC6790F3D0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistics playlist</a></li>

<p>Live chat (Slack, Teams, etc.) sucks for important discussions.</p>



<p>Thinking one line at a time lowers the quality of the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/08/discussion-topics-for-development-teams/">discussion</a>. Knee jerk rapid fire responses become the norm.</p>



<p>Conversations that last weeks or even days get lost and context gets fuzzy. Threads scroll up into the past and are never seen again.</p>



<p>Despite the “asychronous” claim, you have to <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">keep a steady eye on it</a> and reply in realtime or the conversation will move on without you. Anyone who takes the time to ponder and respond thoughtfully with context and explanation will find that they’re too late. </p>



<p>If you go on vacation or even take a few hours of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/13/heads-down-tuesday/">focused time for deep work</a>, you come back to hundreds or thousands of messages. Often your only option is to declare chat room <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">bankruptcy</a> which means missing out on important discussions and big decisions.</p>



<p>I’m not saying live chat is useless. It’s great at some things:</p>



<ul><li>Quick answers to quick questions</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">Low-stakes status updates</a></li><li>Swarming around <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/14/making-the-most-of-post-mortems/">red alerts or outages</a></li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">Fun and belonging</a> (especially for remote workers)</li></ul>



<p>In other words, <strong>live chat is for the things that can get lost.</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/07/a-simple-process-beats-a-perfect-process/">Rule of thumb</a>: <em>If a discussion will matter after today, don’t have it in a chat room.</em> Check out <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, <a href="https://twist.com/">Twist</a>, <a href="https://carrot.io/">Carrot</a>, <a href="https://threads.com/">Threads</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>, or heck even GitHub issues. These tools exist for a reason. They solve a real problem.</p>



<ul><li>They encourage longer form responses rather than quick one liner replies. </li><li>They show you a list of threads <em>with titles</em> for maximum <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">skim-ability</a>. </li><li>They let you sort (by last comment, for example) and filter threads or archive them once a decision has been reached. </li><li>They don’t show online/offline indicators or timezone notifications or “XYZ is typing…” because nobody expects a quick response anyway.</li><li>Some of them even support multi-level (Reddit-style) threading, which can help if a lot of people are involved.</li></ul>



<p>Try it as <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">an experiment</a>. For one sprint, ask if your team will put anything that matters after today in a discussion tool instead of a chat room. Then see if they want to switch back after the sprint ends.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We are experiencing some of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>deadliest days</span></a> in American history, but the magnitude of the ongoing disaster defies human comprehension. As the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths climbed during 2020 and reached new heights in 2021, search volumes for Covid-related terms, specifically “cases” and “deaths,” have not followed suit. One might think that concern about the pandemic, measured through these metrics, would closely follow the severity of the disease. Instead, we are seeing just the opposite: people’s interest has, if anything, declined as the disease has intensified. Why is this and how might it be affecting our response to the pandemic?</p>
<!--more-->
<div><p>As the U.S. trudges through the deadliest period of the pandemic so far, The Factual set out to explore why Americans seemingly care less and less about a disease that is killing thousands prematurely every day. We reviewed 31 articles from 26 sources across the political spectrum to examine human responses to immense suffering and why American’s may be numb to the ongoing impacts of Covid-19.</p></div>

<p>These circles represent some of the deadliest days (from a single cause) in the last 100 years.</p>
<h4><strong><br>Declining Searches for “Cases” and “Deaths”</strong></h4>
<p>More than 370,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, with the daily death toll at its highest yet in recent days. On January 7 alone, 4,112 Americans died. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 standard 737s crashing in a single day, each <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/why-minds-brains-cannot-make-sense-coronavirus-enormous-death-toll/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>loaded with 138 people</span></a>. It’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/days-with-most-us-catastrophe-deaths-16-this-year-2020-12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more American deaths</span></a> than from D-Day in 1944 and more than from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. No matter how we split up and conceptualize these numbers — a tactic journalists use to make impacts <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>more tangible</span></a> — we fail to capture each of the individuals that these statistics include.</p>
<p>As thousands die, Americans are seemingly paying less attention. According to Google’s tracking mechanism for online searches, Google Trends, interest in “cases” and “deaths” <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>peaked</span></a> the week of March 22, when cases were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totalandratecases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rapidly surpassing</span></a> the 100,000 mark but fewer than 50 Americans had died. (The search terms are closely linked, but not exclusive, to the Covid-19 pandemic.) Smaller peaks appear the week of June 21 and, to a lesser degree, in the weeks prior to Thanksgiving — times when warnings were abound about an impending spike in cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the subsequent peaks in Covid-19 deaths, and now, with more than 2,000 deaths every day for the last month, searches for these terms have failed to match the severity of the disease (note, however, that searches for “covid” generally have been consistent with trends in severity). For example, searches for "cases" and "deaths" are now at roughly a quarter of their March and April 2020 peaks, even as 10 times as many cases appear every day and twice as many people die.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This counterintuitive divergence seems to be explained by a combination of psychological, political, and demographic factors. However, at the very least, our inability to comprehend such widespread death continues to undermine our pandemic response.</p></div>

<div><p>Note: Searches are measured on a scale of 1 to 100 from January 12, 2020 to January 9, 2021. 100 represents the highest number of searches in a given week over the time period.<br>Source: <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-01-12%202021-01-09&amp;geo=US&amp;q=cases,deaths" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Trends</span></a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our World in Data</span></a></p></div>
<h4><strong>Psychological Factors</strong></h4>
<p>The most common explanations have to do with human psychology and the way we think about problems. For starters, humans have a hard time <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>comprehending large numbers</span></a> and tend to downplay risk even as the numbers, and risk, increase exponentially. This inability to appreciate larger numbers plays out through “psychic numbing,” a phenomena which suggests that humans are far more impacted and attuned to first instances of danger but grow <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less worried</a> as the numbers increase and the threat is prolonged. For example, the difference between no one dying and one person dying is quite large, but the difference between the 100th and 101st death is far less impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As evidence, scientists have shown that focusing on individuals and personal suffering, rather than large numbers, is much more effective at attracting interest and attention. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/21/covid-why-we-ignore-deaths/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Popularly cited examples</span></a> come from experiments like those conducted by Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, who identified that people are far more likely to donate to help a single starving child than to help successively larger groups of children. Human behavior is prone to connect to individuals and circumstances where we feel we can have an impact. Increasing the number of people dilutes our ability to connect and our perceived ability to make a difference. This effect can be seen elsewhere, such as with <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/08/why-dont-dead-matter/167840/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>wars</span></a> and genocides. Slovic’s work, for one, <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>demonstrates</span></a> that in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide “subjects were less willing to send the same amount of aid to a refugee camp of 250,000 than they were to a refugee camp of 11,000.” This mechanism helps to explain how each additional Covid case or death does not equate to an attendant increase in risk or concern, and may even give way to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>complacency</span></a>.</p>
<div><p>Furthermore, humans are far more attuned to immediate and recognizable risk, such as an armed assailant or an acute natural disaster. It is far more difficult to comprehend the true magnitude of a complex web of <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>seemingly low-risk events</span></a>, be it from a virus with a low mortality rate or from the incremental unseen changes of climate change. Both have effects that are spread over time and hard to capture in any single, concise event. This obscures the connection between human behavior and any positive or negative ramifications. Furthermore, as the symptoms repeat with increasing frequency — be it the 312,672nd death or yet another warmest year on record&nbsp;— each additional iteration tends to make less of an impact. As Melissa Funicane, a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200630-what-makes-people-stop-caring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>put it</span></a>: “the average human who’s not a statistical analyst or epidemiologist, doesn’t have the tools you need at their fingertips to make judgements about something as vast and complex as the global pandemic.”</p></div>
<h4><strong>Political Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Another clear potential reason comes from the spurious narrative that many of these deaths are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-94-percent-covid-among-caus/fact-check-94-of-individuals-with-additional-causes-of-death-still-had-covid-19-idUSKBN25U2IO" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not actually due to Covid-19</span></a>. A popular conspiracy even goes so far as to suggest that medical authorities are attributing deaths from a range of causes to Covid-19 in an effort to make the crisis more dire, spread fear, and permit stronger government action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These narratives have been <a href="https://undark.org/2020/11/10/covid-19-death-counts-conspiracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>repeatedly</span></a> and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-baselessly-suggests-covid-19-deaths-inflated-for-profit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>soundly</span></a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/30/trump-promotes-the-outlandish-claim-that-covid-19-has-killed-a-minuscule-number-of-americans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rejected</span></a>, and many suspect the true toll to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/01/03/trump-claims-covid-deaths-are-exaggerated-as-us-surpasses-350000/?sh=10965bbc37b6" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>even higher</span></a> than the official figures. But whether or not people fully ascribe to the idea that deaths have been over-reported, it has played into doubt around the seriousness of the disease and whether official tallies and government warnings about its seriousness should be trusted. Arguments against the severity of Covid-19, such as that it is little different from the common flu, drive down concern about the virus, especially in more conservative populations. In December, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/#republicans-and-democrats-differ-over-outbreaks-threat-to-public-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>found</span></a> that just 43% of Republicans see Covid-19 as a major threat to public health, compared to 84% of Democrats. Though there is fixation on Covid-19’s low mortality rate, now <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>just below 2%</span></a> in the U.S., there is a larger failure to recognize the scope of human suffering that mortality rate delivers across millions of cases, let alone from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22166236/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-symptoms-heart-fatigue" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>10% (or more) of patients</span></a> who exhibit <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-problem-of-long-haul-covid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>long-term effects</span></a>. The severity of the disease, it seems, often fails to resonate until people are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/12/12/coronavirus-deaths-highest-us-rural-republican-leaning-county/3828902001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>personally, and often irreversibly</span></a>, affected, a dynamic that is <a href="https://grist.org/climate/psychic-numbing-why-rising-covid-and-climate-change-death-tolls-no-longer-shock-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>not restricted</span></a> to the U.S. or the issue Covid-19.</p>
<div><p>In hyper-partisan conditions, it is no surprise that as the disease became politicized, certain populations may have begun to pay less attention. If one doesn’t believe that it is as deadly or widespread as is being reported, there’s little reason to monitor its progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4><strong>Demographic Factors</strong></h4>
<p>A final set of potential factors relates to specific populations that society consistently undervalues. These populations have <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-covid-19-deaths-in-illinois-20210101-etvvpateifbzbbjkf33maqdqme-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffered the worst impacts</span></a> but are also those most commonly pushed out of sight, be it the elderly locked away in nursing homes or minority groups relegated to impoverished and underserved communities.</p>
<p>For example, Covid-19’s impacts are particularly acute on the elderly, who account for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-dying-from-covid-19-why-11601407258" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>roughly 8 in 10</span></a> of those who die. In a range of experiments, scientists have shown globally that people consistently <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>undervalue the elderly</span></a> vis-à-vis others, generally falling back on the explanation that those with fewer years left to live are less valuable than those with many more productive years ahead. Even if each of these individuals may be a deeply loved parent, sibling, friend, or mentor, this implicit devaluation plays into an interpretation that the disease is one that specifically impacts the elderly and is therefore less of a concern.</p>
<div><p>The virus has had a similarly outsized impact on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/14/946045921/how-do-we-grieve-300-000-lives-lost" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>minority communities</span></a>. Data suggests, for example, that Black, Latino, and Indigenous Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to both be hospitalized and die from Covid-19. In LA, the site of the country’s worst outbreak, Latinos <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article247434155.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>account for</span></a> 59% of cases and 48.5% of deaths, even though they only account for 40% of the population. Individuals from these communities make up many of the essential workers who continue to work in <a href="https://theconversation.com/black-and-latino-essential-workers-experience-greater-safety-concerns-than-their-white-counterparts-141180" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>dangerous conditions</span></a> and typically have less of a safety net to fall back on. In a country that has consistently underserved minority communities, especially in <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/23/914427907/as-pandemic-deaths-add-up-racial-disparities-persist-and-in-some-cases-worsen" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matters of public health</a>, it’s no wonder that these communities <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/covid-death-toll-us-empathy-elderly/616379/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>suffer disproportionately</span></a> and that the country as a whole — which is roughly 70% white — may be less attuned to the severity of the problem.</p></div>

<h4><strong>American Deaths Will Continue to Go Unseen</strong></h4>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>This project is a favorite of mine and so I wanted to share a glimpse of what we've been up to with <a href="https://openai.com/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's amazing GPT-3 language model</a>. Today I'll be sharing a couple of straightforward results with basic prompts only. There are more advanced avenues we're exploring for our use of GPT-3, such as fine-tuning (custom pre-training for specific datasets); you'll hear none of that today, but if you're interested in this topic, follow this blog for updates.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>I believe the future of monitoring has to include autonomous root cause tools. Deployment frequency and complexity make the "new" issue the driver of Mean-Time-To-Resolve (MTTR) today. You may always know when something breaks, but you won't always know what. Problem is, root cause often hides in log files... but since the volume of logs has grown enormous and it's not always clear what to search for when a new issue arises, we saw a need for a smarter tool to help with root cause.</p>

<h2>Our approach in a nutshell</h2>
<p>If you structure logs really well (we do this with machine learning), including free-text logs, even when there are only one or two examples for a given event type, you can start talking confidently about a "rare" event. Severity lets you talk about a "bad" event. So, you can imagine one log stream expressing a "rare" event, and then another log stream expressing an event that is both "rare" and "bad". A simple point process model lets us talk naively about how likely it is that such a pair of events should show up as close together in time or closer, given patterns of "rare" and "rare"+"bad" events in those two streams. Watching the data for a while will let you estimate parameters for this model, and you can start picking out bouts of such event pairs. Zebrium takes such a bout, and generates an incident report from it. The results we are seeing…</p>

<h2>The plain language challenge</h2>
<p>Our approach works really well at generating root cause reports: if there's a root cause indicator in the logs, it will almost always make its way into a concise root cause report. Our approach has proven robust to different kinds of applications and logs; it requires no training or rules, pre-built or otherwise.</p>

<p>However, there's a big challenge remaining here. The last mile of delivering the benefits of autonomous Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is translating even the concise reports we generate into something the user can understand. The user who needs the quick RCA is not always the person who can understand the oblique root cause indicators in a technical log file. Who is to consume these reports, and what composes them?</p>

<p>This challenge is even more stark for an Managed Service Provider (MSP) or enterprise. At a small company, engineers may be responsible for front-line triage. At a large company or MSP, there will be a front-line, typically junior person who needs a quick RCA; they can't be expected to know all the different intricacies of application logs and what those logs mean. To bring value over the last mile to them, we need plain-language.</p>

<h2>Enter GPT-3</h2>
<p>Now that I've set the stage, let me show you a couple of examples that I think make it clear how transformational GPT-3 can be in the context of our problem. I think you'll agree with me that autonomous RCA seems a lot more real when it's translated into plain-language, and surely a lot more accessible by a lot of users.</p>

<p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art bidirectional autoregressive transformer model, with parameters in the hundreds of billions. It is produced, trained, and maintained by OpenAI, and it has really brought start-of-the art, deep NLP to developers’ fingertips.</p>

<p>The most basic procedure for using GPT-3 looks like this -</p>

<p>1) Construct a “prompt” for the model – this is a sort of open-ended document that leaves the model to “continue the story”, as it were; the continuation or response is called a “completion”. For the below two-line examples, I used the following simple prompt construction:</p>

<p>An expert examined the logs for the incident.</p>
<p>The first log message was: &lt;first_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The last log message was: &lt;second_line_goes_here&gt;</p>
<p>The expert described what had happened, in plain English:</p>

<p>2) Select model (I used davinci) and parameters - for the below examples, I used the following parameters to the davinci GPT-3 model:</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>"max_tokens": 128,</p>
<p>"temperature": 1,</p>
<p>"top_p": 0.05,</p>
<p>"presence_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"frequency_penalty": 0.3,</p>
<p>"best_of": 10</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>3) Call the API; post-process completion for dangling or repeated phrases, to-taste. Serve warm.</p>

<h2>Example one: Database shutdown</h2>
<p>We shut down the Postgres database backing our Atlassian stack. Thousands of events, largely errors, ensued in the logs. Zebrium dutifully generates a root cause report, based on an ML-driven auto-detection. The report looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png" alt="postgres incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png" alt="postgres incident summary" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=520&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1039&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=1559&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2078&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=2598&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/postgres%20incident%20summary.png?width=3117&amp;name=postgres%20incident%20summary.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>OK, so Zebrium did a pretty good job here. It autonomously picked these two log events out of thousands to display to the user on the list page. Often, the “FIRST” event reflects root cause and the “WORST” reflects follow-on problems; you’ll note here that the first is not even an error, but it’s rare, and happens too close to other incident events, according to our model, to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Now in this case, it’s pretty clear to someone who has looked at a log file before that the database was shut down by the administrator. You’ll also notice, though, above the log events, a field called “DESCRIPTION”: this was generated by GPT-3. It says:</p>

<p>“The database server was stopped by the administrator.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>We passed in the “FIRST” and “WORST” events, as described above, to GPT-3. Notice that the first line says that the “PostgreSQL RDBMS” was “Stopped”. The second line says that there was a “PSQLException” indicating that a connection was “terminating due to administrator command”.</p>

<p>The word “administrator” appears on a different line than the word “PostgreSQL”, and nowhere in the log messages are the words “database” or “server” to be found at all.</p>

<p>The algorithm is doing the following:</p>

<p>1.) Inferring that the statements on the two lines are related</p>
<p>2.) Inferring that they are both speaking about a “database server”</p>
<p>3.) Putting the two statements together: “stopped by the administrator”</p>

<p>Essentially, this is the sort of summary someone would put into a ticketing system; here, it’s being done automatically, thanks to an appropriately selected pair of log messages coupled with a language model.</p>

<h2><span>Example two: Out of memory</span><span></span></h2>
<p>In this case, and using the same parameters as were used in the previous example, we take a root cause report for what turns out to be an out-of-memory issue to GPT-3 and see what sort of summary it gives us.</p>

<p>This particular report was generated in response to a signal from a monitoring tool that saw endpoint latencies spike too high. The system was configured with Zebrium to provide root cause observability across the stack. Here is the report Zebrium ML generated:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png" alt="oom_incident" width="1039" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=520&amp;name=oom_incident.png 520w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1039&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1039w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=1559&amp;name=oom_incident.png 1559w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2078&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2078w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=2598&amp;name=oom_incident.png 2598w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident.png?width=3117&amp;name=oom_incident.png 3117w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px"></p>

<p>As you can see, Zebrium pulled about a dozen log events into the report; the first 9 are shown in the image. You’ll notice that the first event is colored green and the last event purple; these are the “FIRST” and the “WORST”, and we use these to characterize the incident in the incidents list. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png" alt="oom_incident_summary" width="908" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=454&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 454w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=908&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 908w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1362&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1362w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=1816&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 1816w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2270&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2270w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blogs/oom_incident_summary.png?width=2724&amp;name=oom_incident_summary.png 2724w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></p>

<p>In this case, it’s not so clear that the problem is due to an out-of-memory issue, unless the reader is familiar with Linux and the OOM killer facility. There are a lot of technical parameters in these events as well, obscuring what was really at the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a look above the log messages again, in the “DESCRIPTION” field, let’s see what GPT-3 gave us:</p>

<p>“The memcached process was killed by the OOM killer</p>
<p>because it was consuming too much memory. The OOM killer</p>
<p>is a Linux kernel feature that allows the system to kill</p>
<p>a process when <strong><u>the system is running out of memory</u></strong>.”</p>

<h2>Why this summary is also amazing</h2>
<p>What this summary tells us explicitly in plain-language is that the system was running out of memory. This is in fact the root cause of the original incident, tallying up a successful root cause summary.</p>

<p>For an L1 or L2, the Zebrium root cause summary may not be enough. That person won’t necessarily know that OOM means out-of-memory, or that the “FIRST” message isn’t talking about an application issue entirely within memcached.</p>

<h2>What more I wanted here</h2>
<p>In the second example, I would have liked to have seen some recognition that the first line implies that the system was out-of-memory, and therefore the second line was due to related problems (in fact, the application server was paged out). It’s a lot to ask, but I think it might be possible, given some combination of more expressive prompts, finetuning, and presenting GPT-3 with other select data from the report (in this case, the report also included metrics anomalies showing a plunge in swap free).</p>

<h2><span>A cool direction</span></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that GPT-3 gave us a lot of extra detail about the Linux OOM killer than was mentioned in the log messages themselves. I believe it was able to provide this context in the same way it knew that PSQL referred to a database server: it was trained on the internet. There is likely enough information in the public domain that, as GPT-3 was being trained, it picked up enough cursory knowledge of these sorts of systems to add additional value.</p>

<p>To test my hypothesis, I spent some time fiddling quite unscientifically with the prompt and model parameters, trying to get it to expound on the OOM example as describe above. I also gave the model a much larger budget of response tokens. Eventually, I teased out this response:</p>

<p>The root cause of the …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>ExaGear is a dynamic binary translation layer to run x86_32 and x86_64 applications on Arm 64-bit Linux systems.</p>



<p>You can download it <a href="https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/kunpeng/archive/ExaGear/ExaGear_V100R002C00.tar.gz">here</a>. On an RPM-based distribution, just unpack the archive and install.</p>



<p>A CentOS 7 rootfs is shipped, you might want to install vte-profile afterwards.</p>



<h4>Hardware requirements</h4>



<p>A 64-bit Arm CPU with floating point and SIMD extensions. If it can run a conventional Linux distribution, it’ll be able to run this.</p>



<h4>Kernel requirements</h4>



<p>You’ll have to install the p64k variant for systems with a 64KB page size set up (which ships with the x86_64 -&gt; arm64 translator only, not the x86_32 to arm64 one). Some applications might not work on such a system.</p>



<p>You’ll also need a kernel with 48-bit VA space, 39-bit of VA space kernel configurations are not compatible with ExaGear.</p>



<h4>Memory model</h4>



<p>ExaGear does not follow TSO completely by default, using heuristics instead. This can be configured through /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf.</p>



<p>SMO_MODE=fbase is the default, with SMO_SEVERITY=smart. For full compliance, you can run those commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_32.conf
sudo sed -i -e '/EXAGEAR_SMO_MODE="/s/fbase"/all"/' /etc/exagear-x86_64.conf</code></pre>



<p>On Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier, you’ll want to set SMO_MODE=none, as their CPU implements sequential consistency as the memory model. This setting provides a free performance boost with no downsides on that hardware.</p>



<h4>Performance</h4>



<p>For running your Docker containers or whatever on an Apple Silicon Mac too, this is a much faster solution than qemu-user.</p>



<p>Some performance numbers on Tegra Xavier: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/4206324?baseline=4206183</a>. (Geekbench arm64 Android compared to x86_64 Linux Geekbench results on the same hardware)</p>



<p>Because ExaGear doesn’t implement the AES instructions, the scores for those is an outlier. Apart from that case, the results are pretty good.</p>

<p>
From the Snowden revelations we learned not only about NSA data collection projects, but also about many software tools that are used to analyze and search those data. These programs run on secure computer networks, isolated from the public internet. Here we will provide an overview of these networks that are used by the US military and US intelligence agencies.</p><p>

Besides computer networks, they also use a number of dedicated telephone networks, but gradually these are transferred from traditional circuit-switched networks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP" target="_blank">Voice over IP</a> (VoIP). This makes it possible to have only one IP packet-switched network for both computer and phone services. It seems that for example NSA's <a href="http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/02/nsa-director-alexanders-phones.html#nsts">NSTS</a> phone system is now fully IP-based.</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hfFQW77nKhY/VPUo9x2bk3I/AAAAAAAACOc/MvGIApP5UE0/s1600/nsa-nsoc2006.jpg" width="450"></a><br>

An old NSTS telephone and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch" target="_blank">KVM-switch</a> which enables switching between physically<br>

The main US military and intelligence computer networks are (of course) only accessible for authorized personnel from the United States. Special security measures are in place to prevent interception by foreign intelligence agencies. Most of the tools and programs used by NSA run on JWICS and NSANet, but here we only mention them when this is confirmed by  documents. </p><blockquote>

These various military and intelligence networks run on a world-wide physical infrastructure that is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Information_Systems_Network" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Network</a> (DISN), which is maintained by the <a href="http://www.disa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Information Systems Agency</a> (DISA) and consists of landline, mobile, radio and satellite communication links.</p><p>

Most of these communication links are not connected to the public internet, but because radio and satellite transmissions can easily be intercepted by foreign countries, the security of these networks is assured by encryption. This encryption can also be used to run higher classified traffic over communication links with a lower classification level through Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels.</p><p>

Classified communications have to be protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A Cryptography</a>, which contains very strong and classified encryption algorithms. On most networks this is implemented by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_product" target="_blank">Type 1</a> certified <a href="http://www.gdc4s.com/products/secure-voice-and-data-products-catergory-listing/network-encryption.html?taxonomyCat=326" target="_blank">TACLANE</a> (KG-175A/D) in-line network encryptors made by General Dynamics:</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4T0EMTWJlI/VP_kSFDBEDI/AAAAAAAACQ0/b3HG2jTkZqg/s1600/taclane_interop_2011.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

<p>

As long there's the appropriate strong link encryption, only the end points with the computer terminals (where data are processed before they are encrypted) need strict physical and digital security requirements in order to prevent any kind of eavesdropping or interception by foreign adversaries.</p><p>

Most American military bases are connected to the SIPRNET backbone, but for tactical users in the field, the SIPRNet and JWICS networks can extend to mobile sites through Satellite Communications (SATCOM) links, like for example <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/TROJAN_SPIRIT" target="_blank">TROJAN SPIRIT</a> and TROJAN SPIRIT LITE, which consist of a satellite terminal that can be on a pallet, in a shelter, on a trailer or even connected to a transit case.</p><p>

Besides the aforementioned networks that are only accessible for authorized military and intelligence personnel from the United States, there are also computer networks set up by the US for multinational coalitions, and which therefore can also be used by officials from partner countries. </p><p>

The group of countries that have access to such coalition networks is often denoted by a number of "Eyes" corresponding with the number of countries that participate.</p>

January 12, 2021 | https://nbailey.ca/post/rotary-phone-voip/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nbailey.ca/post/rotary-phone-voip/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>One of the worst parts of modern life is how <em>unsatisfying</em> it is to hang up on somebody. Tapping on the ‘End Call’ button on an iPhone or angrily clicking ‘Leave Meeting’ on Zoom just isn’t nearly as fun as slamming down the handset on a <em>real phone</em>.</p>
<p>This particular project was to breathe some life into the antique Northern Telecom phone from my grandparents’ house by attaching it to a modern VoIP system. This was surprisingly difficult, but very satisfying as the result is essentially a free ‘vintage’ landline for my home.</p>
<p><img src="https://nbailey.ca/images/nt500.jpg" alt="Northern Telecom model 500"></p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-phone">The Phone</h3>
<p>The device in question is a NT analog phone, based on the classic Western Electric model 500. The models are very similar with only minor differences, for example the printing of the numbers on the dial is slightly different for models from Canada. Based on the stamp marks on the bottom, I believe this phone was manufactured in 1969 and installed shortly after, which does match up with when my grandparents would have purchased their first phone.</p>
<p>On its own, this telephone would not work with any modern telecom system. The ‘pulse dial’ that it produces is not compatible with modern telephone equipment and VoIP adapters alike.</p>
<p>I can’t get a good source on this, but most telephone exchanges in urban areas haven’t accepted pulse dial signals for decades. Some areas may still accept pulse signalling depending on the age of their equipment, but in 2021 I doubt there are many left. Seeing as how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling">DTMF</a>) signalling has been the standard for over forty years, <em>nearly all</em> VoIP equipment was manufactured without support for old devices.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-dialling">Pulse Dialling</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/pulse-dialing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/">Photo Source: RF Wireless World</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pulse dialing is very simple as it is derived from the mechanical rotation of the dial. As it turns from the dialed digit back to the resting position it toggles the local loop voltage to transmit the data to the FXO. In the old days, these voltage ‘ticks’ were used to rotate mechanical switches in the exchange stations to connect physical circuits needed to complete a call.</p>
<h3 id="dtmf-dialling">DTMF Dialling</h3>
<p>DTMF on the other hand is an in-band signalling method using eight different frequencies transmitted in pairs. To use the example from Wikipedia, to transmit a ‘1’ on a DTMF system it will transmit two tones, 1209Hz and 695Hz together:</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/MultiTone1.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling#/media/File:MultiTone1.png">Photo Source: Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tones are the beeps we’re used to hearing when dialing. Even my cell phone creates these tones when you type on the on-screen keypad in the ‘Phone’ app, though it’s mostly for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Theoretically one could use these tones to dial on a rotary phone if you held the speaker of the cell phone up to the microphone of the telephone while dialling, though I couldn’t get it to reliably work.</p>
<h3 id="converting-signalling">Converting signalling</h3>
<p>So, the first piece of equipment I needed was a pulse-tone converter. Indeed, such a device does exist to convert the ‘ticks’ produced by the rotary dial to the ‘beeps’ produced by most keypad phones. I was a little squeamish about tearing apart a working antique, so I opted to buy an external dial tone converter box from <a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converters/">OldPhoneWorks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/images/D/small%202-212.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.oldphoneworks.com/pulse-to-tone-converter.html">Photo Source: OldPhoneWorks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very simple device which listens for the pulse tones and using tiny DSP chips converts them to DTMF tones. If your only goal was to use the old phone with a POTS landline this would be sufficient, but I want to connect this to VoIP.</p>
<h3 id="the-sip-ata-box">The SIP ATA box</h3>
<p>There are <em>heaps</em> of Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) boxes on the market, but in the interest of keeping this project low-cost I opted to purchase a new-old-stock <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/pap2t/administration/guide/pap2t_user.pdf">Linksys PAP2T-NA</a> device from eBay. I wasn’t too worried about security since the device sits in the ‘enclave’ part of my home network isolated from personal devices, and won’t have any ports forwarded to it. I was initially worried that my custom <a href="https://nbailey.ca/post/linux-firewall-ids">Linux router</a> would cause issues with the UDP traffic RTP creates, but it handled it wonderfully.</p>
<p>Setup was fairly straightforward to begin with, entering my sub-account credentials and SIP proxy server. Without too much fuss the device was registered and communicating with my provider.</p>
<p>However, I did run into some strange issues after initially setting it up. First, the ring pattern was intermittent and sounded <em>strange</em>. After a couple test calls I also found that both sides of the conversation were quiet when using the vintage phone. With some fiddling, I rectified these by increasing power limits slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed ring waveform to Sinusoid</li>
<li>Changed ring voltage to 90</li>
<li>Changed FXS port power limit -3 -&gt; 5</li>
<li>Changed FXS port input &amp; output gain -3 -&gt; 0</li>
</ul>
<p>I chalk these up to the mechanical nature of the ringer and the age of the mic/speaker. After all, there’s a lot more energy involved in moving a hammer around than powering a little beeper.</p>
<h3 id="making-calls">Making calls</h3>
<p>That night, I successfully ordered a pizza using an antique phone. Dialing was laborious, but novel for somebody my age, and honestly kind of fun.</p>
<p>Monthly costs are minimal, only $0.80 for the DID number and an additional $0.005 per minute. Calls are clear and sound great, and after nearly a month of use I can say that it’s reliable and solid as a ‘landline’ replacement. Plus, it makes a great conversation piece!</p>
<p>There are certainly improvements I would could make, for example adding SRTP to add another layer of security for my calls. It would also be nice to add additional handsets to my house to build an ‘intercom’ - that is if I can find more old phones.</p>

When I first discovered it in 2016, I really liked how it can almost be fully customized as per the likes. Well, almost, because there was no way you could add or configure any buttons on the top side of the editor. FYI, this is possible in many popular IDEs like IntelliJ, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and even Notepad++. I was more of a mouse-guy back then so the lack of GUI buttons was hindering my so called <em>developer productivity</em>.</p><p>I decided to build an extension for this. That would add handy buttons for many common commands like save file, format (beautify) file, show opened files list, etc. To build this, I followed VSCode extension development docs and learned typescript along the way. I named it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jerrygoyal.shortcut-menu-bar">Shortcut Menu Bar</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/1.png" alt="Shortcut Menu Bar"><figcaption>Shortcut Menu Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Fast-forward to 2020, and it got over 10k+ downloads and multiple 5-star ratings. I guess I wasn't the only mouse-guy out there.<br>
<!-- -->Out of Covid boredom, I decided to put a donate button to see what happens. I explored few platforms to create donation links like buymeacoffee.com (charges 5% fee), patreon.com (more geared towards recurring donations, 5% fee), PayPal (UI sucks), Ko-Fi.com (0% fee and nice clean UI).</p><p>I made a free account on ko-fi.com, linked my PayPal account, and created a donation link. I added that link to the extension description.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/2.png" alt="Buy me a coffee"><figcaption>Buy me a coffee</figcaption></figure><p>And guess what? someone donated 5$.</p><figure><img src="https://gourav.io/_next/static/media/pages/blog/first-donation-on-open-source-side-project/3.png" alt="donation via ko-fi.com"><figcaption>donation via ko-fi.com</figcaption></figure><p>I know I know, it's not that big amount, but somebody put an effort to make that transaction means he cared about it and found it useful.
I hope it inspires people who want to contribute and build stuff in the FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) community. It's so captivating that the whole tech industry relies (and thrives) on open source software made by people in their free time.<br>

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a>

  <p>There is nothing like having your application in production. You and your users will find bugs, surprising behavior, and new challenges in ways that simply don’t happen in any other environment. Consider the initial period of time after launch — hours or days depending on when demand stabilizes — as sacrosanct, an opportunity to focus on operations, system availability, and providing reliable service to your users.</p>

<p>Ad Hoc has been a part of many high-profile launches in government, starting with coming in to help rescue the early troubled launch of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a>, to subsequent, increasingly smoother open enrollment periods for that same website, to the transformation of <a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA.gov</a>, among others. We’ve seen first-hand the stakes of getting launch wrong, and the value in doing it right.</p>

<p>In order to properly prepare for launch, take the following hard-won experiential advice into account.</p>

<p>tl;dr: My ISP’s CGNAT session timeout is too short, meaning TCP keepalives gets dropped. Test if your own NAT, or your ISP’s CGN, violates <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382">RFC5382</a>‘s REQ-5 using this tool: <a href="https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test">https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test</a>.</p>



<p>I have been working from home more lately, where I have SSH sessions open to the servers that I’m working on. Often when I return to my computer, or switch to a SSH session that has been sitting idle for a while, the SSH connection is either dead or frozen. If the session is not already dead, the only way to gain control over my terminal again, is to send the ‘terminate connection’ <a href="https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/11/08/ssh-escape-sequences-aka-kill-dead-ssh-sessions/">ssh escape sequence</a> <strong>&lt;enter&gt;~.</strong> after which SSH errors like this:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d7b6a3b897babea5a5b8a5a4f9b3b8a3a4a5b4f9b8a5b0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ 
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe</pre>



<p>This happened one day while I was transferring a VM image in the hundreds of gigabytes from one server to another using netcat like so:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6f0e1b002f07001c1b5d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -l 1337 &gt; hugefile 
<a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="83e2f7ecc3ebecf0f7b2">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -q 1 host2 1337 &lt; hugefile</pre>



<p>This transfer would take multiple hours, and when I checked in after it should have finished, my SSH connections had died yet again. And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.</p>



<p>That’s when I decided to investigate this problem.</p>



<p>The OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers are known for their extreme focus on code quality. The chances that this problem is caused by a bug in OpenSSH are very slim. (In the same line as “It is (almost) never a compiler error.”)</p>



<p>This is probably a network problem.</p>



<p>I connected my laptop directly to my ISP’s “customer-provided equipment”: a coax modem in bridge mode. Then I ran tcpdump both on my laptop and on the server, and opened a SSH connection. After leaving it idle for about 2 1/2 hours, this is the result:</p>

<p>A SSH session does not generate any traffic, unless there’s new output or input. The same is true for TCP. That is why, after the TCP and SSH sessions have been established, no more packages are sent for a long time.</p>



<p>First thing to note, is that my laptop gets an IP in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598">Carrier-grade NAT address space 100.64.0.0/10</a>, which my ISP then translates to a public internet routable IP. (Because I don’t want to leak my public IP, I used the <a href="https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcprewrite">tcprewrite</a> tool to substitute that IP with one in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737">TEST-NET-3</a>).</p>



<p>Next thing to note, is that after about 2 hours, both the client and the server starts to send TCP-keepalive packages, but none of them come through to the other side.</p>



<p>Finally the client gives up on the TCP session, and sends a TCP reset package, which surprisingly goes through.</p>



<p>Lets see what we can find in the OpenSSH man pages about timeouts and keepalives (ssh_config(5)):</p>



<pre><strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong>
    Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.&nbsp; If they are sent, death of the
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.&nbsp; This option only uses TCP keepalives (as op‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.&nbsp; As such, you proba‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bly want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.&nbsp; However, this means that connections will die if the route is down
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The default is yes</strong> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the re‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mote host dies.&nbsp; This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no.&nbsp; See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepalives.
<strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong>
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a mes‐
    sage through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.&nbsp; <strong>The default is 0, indicating that these</strong>
    <strong>messages will not be sent to the server</strong>, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific). </pre>



<p>So <strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong> enables keepalives handled by the TCP stack implementation (Linux in my case), whereas <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> enables protocol level keep-alives (handled by OpenSSH).</p>



<p>This explains the behavior we’re observing, but also raises new questions:</p>



<ol><li>Can I fix my problem by enabling the ssh protocol-level-keepalives? (ServerAliveInterval)</li><li>Why are the TCP keepalives only sent after 2 hours?</li><li>Why is my ISP dropping my TCP keepalive packages?</li></ol>



<p>I verified that by setting <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> to 300 (5 min), my problems disappeared. We could stop now that I found a workaround, but let’s keep digging.</p>



<p>The TCP keepalive interval on Linux is configured by <strong>net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time</strong>, which by default is set to 2 hours (7200).</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d7b6b9b3b2a5a497a2b5a2b9a3a2fab3b2a4bca3b8a7">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 7200</pre>



<p>Why is it set to two hours? We find our answer in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC1122</a>:</p>



<pre>Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
acknowledgement packets have been received for the
connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
configurable and <strong>MUST default to no less than two hours</strong>.</pre>



<p>In the following DISCUSSION section, the RFC writers elaborate on why they (in 1989) think TCP keep-alives only should be sent infrequently:</p>



<pre>The TCP specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism because it could:
(1) cause perfectly good connections to break during transient Internet failures;
(2) consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and
(3) cost money for an Internet path that charges for packets.</pre>



<p>Today the Internet is different from what it was in 1989 when they published that RFC. Now we have NAT everywhere, which is a hack that was accepted on IPv4 because the IPv4 address space is too small. The real solution is IPv6 which has a much bigger address space (2^32 vs 2^128).</p>



<p>NAT (Network Address Translation) allows many computers on a network to share the same IP. This typically works by routing your packet to a device which translates/substitutes your private <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> IP (e.g 192.168.0.0/16) for a public one, and passes on the packet.</p>



<p>CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) is NAT run by an ISP. This allows for many customers to share a single public IP (because even with every household being assigned a single IPv4, we’re still running out). To avoid collisions with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> ranges, ISPs are told to use the 100.64.0.0/10 range. With this setup it is not uncommon to have 3 levels of NAT. Ex, CGN, CPE that also does NAT, and the customers own router.</p>



<p>A NAT device must keep track of which connections are made by the clients. This information is stored in the NAT table. Whenever a packet arrives from the Internet, it checks if the packet belongs to any connections in its NAT table, to figure determine which client to send the package to. If it doesn’t belong to any connections, it drops the packet.</p>



<p>This wouldn’t work if the NAT table only stored IP addresses – which client should the NAT device send the packet to if receiving a packet from a server two of its clients are connected to? That is why – unlike routers – NAT devices have to cross protocol boundaries, and look deeper inside the packet and find a “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3022">transport identifier</a>“. For TCP and UDP the identifiers used are the source and destination port numbers, and for ICMP the Query <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">Identifier</a> is usually used.</p>



<p>A NAT table looks something like this (we’ll ignore ICMP for now):</p>



<pre>PROTOCOL SRCIP       SRCPORT DSTIP          DSTPORT NEWSRCPORT IDLETIME
TCP      192.168.1.1 52264   130.225.254.99 22      52264      983
UDP      192.168.1.2 39252   8.8.8.8        53      39252      4</pre>



<p>This NAT hack unfortunately opened up Pandora’s box of problems that we are still dealing with today. For example, you can no longer initiate a connection to a computer behind NAT. The NAT device does not know which host to send the packet to. This is why NAT’ing is often equated with firewalling. It is not a feature as such. It is a side effect of the NAT hack.</p>



<p>Back when NAT was introduced, it was not uncommon for protocols to rely on the server establishing a second connection back to the client. In “Active FTP” for example, the server will initiate a new connection back to the client (the data channel) after the client has connected. For this to work the NAT must be even more protocol aware, and preemptively create a mapping for the requested port. This is the same for SIP (used for VoIP) and a few other protocols. This is why most NAT devices can be configured to be FTP and SIP aware. Exactly this feature was recently shown to be a huge security problem – you can trigger this functionality to create a mapping of your choosing from a visitors browser, and connect to any device behind the visitors NAT. Read more about the <a href="https://github.com/samyk/slipstream">NAT Slipstreaming attack here</a>.</p>



<p>For big data transfers, or latency sensitive connections (file sharing, VoIP, gaming etc) it is very much preferable to have a direct connection between hosts. But if both hosts are behind a NAT, this is not immediately possible. To solve this problem, a new hack was introduced: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389">NAT hole punching</a>, where you – by using a third-party – can trick your NAT devices to allow traffic directly between the hosts by creating a NAT table entry (“punching”) in both NATs simultaneously. It is only somewhat reliable, and works best with UDP in my experience.</p>



<p>NAT is also one of the reasons the new <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/?include_text=1">QUIC</a> protocol uses UDP packages instead of its own protocol. Too many devices will fail to handle the packet correctly if they introduced a new <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml">protocol number</a>. Where should the NAT device look for a transport identifier in an unknown protocol header?</p>



<p>Another problem that arises because of NAT is: when is it safe to remove an entry from the NAT table? Sometimes the answer is simple: when you see that the connection has been closed (e.g the TCP Normal Close Sequence). But when is it safe to remove an established TCP connection (were you haven’t yet seen the connection being closed) on which no packages have …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>For many Americans, the events of the past week have left emotions raw, tempers hot, and for some, social media accounts deactivated. </p><p>It’s a reasonable response by those who believe various social networks allowed disinformation to flourish, or worse: allowed seditious plots to metastasize on their platforms, which led to a mob storming the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The very social platforms that are being (rightly) targeted for their role in fanning the flames of an insurrection are the same ones that drive traffic to news sites. To exist today, newsrooms have little to no choice: social platforms are a necessary evil.</p><p>The irony is astounding: a boycott protesting the spread of disinformation could be so harmful to the viability of journalism. This is why we need so desperately to detangle the fates of newsrooms from that of social platforms. </p><p>Reliable, factual updates are a requirement for an informed citizenry, and Democracy cannot function without one. &nbsp;And for an industry operating on ever decreasing margins, the page views that come from these platforms &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nillium.com/news-was-never-meant-for-social-platforms/">are keeping them alive</a>, even as the business models associated with this set up slowly kill them. &nbsp;</p><p>News is expensive. &nbsp;Long before any article is written, before any video is shot, reporters spend time on the phone, traveling to meet with sources, often to only find that there is no story there. &nbsp;They do it usually because of a passion for keeping their fellow citizens informed, for striving to uncover the truth. &nbsp;But they also have expenses, and need to be paid.</p><p>As ad dollars and traffic coalesce around a few major players online, news websites had to adapt. &nbsp;They have written ever-more catchy headlines to grab attention. The story selection has become driven by trending topics in an effort to appear at the top of newsfeeds. &nbsp;The algorithms behind such feeds make local news even harder to find because, by definition, it doesn’t appeal to the widest audience possible. &nbsp;The sites, in turn, had to make the most of what traffic they could get; covering pages in ads and trackers. &nbsp;It’s a spiral to the bottom.</p><p>But, it’s not too late to turn things around.</p><p>For those that want to make an impact, please support journalism. Subscribe to your local newspaper.</p><p>We need to think about weaning news from platforms that have such a parasitic impact. &nbsp;If we cannot find a viable model for trustworthy news online, we will be left with the only information sources that seem to be thriving now; the least credible of them all. &nbsp;</p><p>Our solution is relatively simple. &nbsp;We’re building a platform that takes the best from social media -- the concise updates, the real time streams, and the direct line of communication from reporters, but in a news-friendly way. &nbsp;Our ads appear in between updates, not tying their value to any individual click through, and revenue is shared according to the contributions to the platform, not views. &nbsp;We’re only allowing trusted journalists to post, blocking disinformation before it has a chance to root itself in our systems.</p><p>We invite you to join us, and welcome any suggestions or improvements.</p><p><em>Nillium is building Forth, a new news platform based on concise updates from trusted journalists, sharing advertising revenue with the reporters and their newsrooms. &nbsp;To sign up for our waiting list, <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">click here</a>. &nbsp; Newsrooms and independent reporters can express their interest in joining the platform <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpLKCBdKrkOqCiaHheoOQBCvqbR3ydaCW1N1sy69RNLJGwQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.478247111=blog.nillium.com">here</a>.</em></p>

January 11, 2021 | https://www.justingarrison.com/blog/2021-01-11-getting-started-with-signal/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.justingarrison.com/blog/2021-01-11-getting-started-with-signal/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>You’ve discovered that <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> can provide you with secure communication from your phone that is cross platform and free!</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-og-banner.png" alt=""></p><p>First of all you may be asking “who makes Signal?”
Signal Messenger LLC. is the company that makes the Signal app.
They are funded by the Signal Foundation which is a non-profit organization that relies on <a href="https://signal.org/donate/">your donations</a> to make the app free and not have ulterior motives with your data.</p><p>The foundation’s mission is</p><blockquote><p>To develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.</p></blockquote><p>The Signal app is all <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">open source on GitHub</a> and their protocols are well documented and available <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">on their website</a>.</p><p>But that’s not why you’re here.
Let’s show you some tips to get the most out of your new secure messaging app.</p><h2 id="important-settings">Important settings</h2><p>Signal is great, but there are a few things you may want to change depending on how secure or private you want your communications.</p><h3 id="notifications">Notifications.</h3><p>You can disable what is shown in notifications to help with privacy.
Turn off whatever you don’t want shown.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-notification-content.png" alt=""></p><p>You may also want to disable the notification you get when one of your contacts join Signal.
Especially ad the rapid pace people are joining.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-contact-notifications.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3><p>You can set the Signal app to lock when your phone locks under privacy.
It may also be a good idea to enable incognito keyboard which will ask your keyboard to remove personalization while typing.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-privacy.png" alt=""></p><p>You can turn off read receipts, typing indicators, and automatic link previews under the communication settings.
Link previews only work on <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360022474332-Link-Previews">sites that use <code>https://</code></a></p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-communication-settings.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="chats-and-media">Chats and media</h3><p>In chats you can change when to auto-download files.
Some of these can be quite large so it may be a good idea to only automatically download on Wi-Fi.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-media-download.png" alt=""></p><p>At the very bottom of Chats and media is a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages">message backup option</a>.
The backup is encrypted and stored locally on your phone.
If you’re using a backup service for your phone they will also be backed up to the cloud which you may or may not want (even if it’s encrypted).</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-chat-backups.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="linked-devices">Linked devices</h3><p>You can use Signal from another device including tablets and laptops.
Install the Signal app on the other device and it will show a QR code.
Open the linked devices setting and click the + button at the bottom.
Scan the QR code and you’re all set.</p><p>If you tap on an existing linked device you have the option to remove it from being able to send or receive messages.
Be aware that any existing messages on the device may still be available and cached on the device.
This setting is not a “secure wipe.”</p><h2 id="chats-and-calls">Chats and calls</h2><p>Signal chats work similarly to traditional SMS messaging apps.
You can send text, emoji, and stickers, or attach pictures, gifs (searched from giphy), files, contacts, or locations.
You can record voice messages by holding the microphone.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-message-attach.png" alt=""></p><p>You can also make audio or video calls when you select a contact and click the icons in the top banner.
All calls are encrypted and can optionally go through a relay server so you do not expose your IP address to the recipient.
You can enable the relay server in settings -&gt; privacy -&gt; communication.</p><p>A relay is a server that Signal controls that your call will go through.
Similar to a VPN in the way it would expose the server IP to the recipient without exposing your IP.
If you’re interested in the Signal server architecture you can check out <a href="https://sorincocorada.ro/signal-messanger-architecture/">this post</a>.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-relay-calls.png" alt=""></p><p>A single hallow check box next to a message you sent means your message was sent.
Two check marks means the message was delivered.
Once the recipient reads the message the check marks will fill in.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-double-checks-hallow.png" alt="">
<img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-doublechecks-filled.png" alt=""></p><p>If you see a little person icon next to the person’s name in chat it means that person is in your contacts.
If you want their name to automatically be filled out you can go into your phone’s contacts and add the number to a contact.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-contact.png" alt=""></p><p>If you open a chat you can look in settings and enable disappearing messages.
This is super helpful to prevent messages persisting.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-disappearing.png" alt=""></p><p>You can—and should—verify a contact to make sure you’re really talking to them.
This verifies the encryption keys used at both ends of the conversation.
You can do that manually or automatically by scanning their QR code.</p><p>Ideally you will do this verification out-of-band from Signal either in person or through some other video/image sharing service.
Facetime, zoom, etc. are great options if you can’t meet in person.</p><p>Once you verify a contact you’ll see “Verified” text under their name.
If you manually mark the contact as verified it will show a message in the chat that you marked them verified.</p><h3 id="group-messages">Group messages</h3><p>You can create a group message from the main screen clicking the pencil and then “New group.”</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-new-group.png" alt=""></p><p>Add contacts to the group and you’re ready to go.</p><p>You have similar settings to 1:1 chats.
You can have a group video call with up to 8 people and a group chat with up to 150 people—RIP notifications!
If you want to have a group call without video you need to start a video call and disable your camera before you join.</p><p>You can change who can invite people to the group or make a group link easier for someone to share if they’re not in your contacts.</p><p>The links are public but an admin needs to approve members joining the group by default.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-group-link.png" alt=""></p><p>Group video calls work the same way as 1:1 calls but groups don’t have audio only calls—although you can disable your video in a video call.</p><h2 id="other-things-to-consider">Other things to consider</h2><p>If you want to use signal without giving out your real phone number you can use a service like twilio that will provide you a forwarding number.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://mshelton.medium.com/using-signal-without-giving-your-phone-number-3a575580f652">this great guide</a> on how to set it up.</p><h3 id="your-safety-number-has-changed">Your safety number has changed</h3><p>If you see this seemingly scary message don’t be alarmed.
It likely just means the <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed-">person on the other end of the conversation</a> got a new phone or re-installed Signal.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-safety-number.png" alt=""></p><p>You can still verify the persons safety number to make sure there is no man-in-the-middle attacks.
This is distinctly different than how iMessage and Telegram work because in both of those apps they store your private key.</p><h3 id="pins">Pins</h3><p>Pins are important because they will enable Signal to get rid of phone number requirements.</p><p>The <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059792-Signal-PIN">support page</a> says it best</p><blockquote><p>Your Signal PIN is a code used to support features like non-phone number based identifiers. This means that your PIN can recover your profile, settings, contacts, and who you’ve blocked if you ever lose or switch devices. A PIN can also serve as an optional registration lock to prevent others from registering your number on your behalf.</p></blockquote><p>It hasn’t rolled out yet but has been in the works for a while.</p><p>If you want to stay up to date on signal news I highly recommend you follow the <a href="https://signal.org/blog/">Signal blog</a>.
They have lots of great technical and non-technical information on new features and news.</p></article></div>]]>

January 11, 2021 | https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>(Day 10 of <a href="https://aduros.com/blog/30-days-of-blogging">30 Days of Blogging</a>)</p>
<p>A couple months back I switched my terminal from xfce4-terminal to the venerable xterm. For some
reason I always put xterm in the same bucket as xclock, xmessage, or any other prehistoric command
starting with X that comes pre-installed on any graphical Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It was surprising to learn that xterm is still very much <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html">actively
developed</a>. Even more surprisingly, it turns out
xterm has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">incredibly low input latency</a> compared to modern
terminals. This is easy to test at home, try typing in xterm compared to any other terminal and feel
how much snappier it is.</p>
<p>The lower latency alone is worth the price of admission in my opinion, so I went about configuring
xterm as my default terminal. The configuration goes in <code>~/.Xresources</code> and you need to run <code>xrdb ~/.Xresources</code> after every change, or <a href="https://github.com/aduros/dotfiles/blob/eab476fc62e74e46cb41bb5c094cede7a28a014f/home/.config/nvim/options.vim#L27">make vim do
it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>Here are some “modern” sensible defaults I ended up landing on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Sensible defaults
XTerm.vt100.locale: false
XTerm.vt100.utf8: true
XTerm.vt100.scrollTtyOutput: false
XTerm.vt100.scrollKey: true
XTerm.vt100.bellIsUrgent: true
XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true
</code></pre></div><p>And here are some visual styling options, not including colors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Styling
XTerm.vt100.faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
XTerm.vt100.boldMode: false
XTerm.vt100.faceSize: 11
XTerm.vt100.internalBorder: 16
XTerm.borderWidth: 0
</code></pre></div><p>XTerm supports key binding, but the syntax is non-obvious:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;N: scroll-back(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;T: scroll-forw(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
</code></pre></div><p>This allows copying and pasting to the clipboard (not just the X selection) with shift-ctrl-C and V.
It also allows scrolling up and down with shift-ctrl-N and T (you can switch this to K and J to
match vim keys in Qwerty).</p>
<h2 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h2>
<p>So now we have a pretty usable setup, but there’s one more incredibly useful feature that was hard
to figure out: opening URLs in the browser. We could of course select the URL and copy-paste, but
there’s a better way.</p>
<p>XTerm has a configuration option called <code>printerCommand</code> which is a command that is piped all the
text currently visible in the terminal. As the name suggests, it’s meant to be used to implement
printing to physical paper, but we can save the trees and hijack it to instead scan the screen for
URLs and open the browser:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>#!/bin/sh -e
</span><span></span>
grep -Eo <span>'\bhttps?://\S+\b'</span> |
    uniq |
    ifne rofi -dmenu -i -p <span>"Open URL"</span> -auto-select |
    xargs xdg-open
</code></pre></div><p>This greps for URLs, removes consecutive duplicates with <code>uniq</code>, and displays a
<a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> menu to choose between them if there were multiple URLs.
<code>ifne</code> is included in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/moreutils">moreutils</a>. Put this
script in an executable file called <code>select-url</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> and then add this to <code>.Xresources</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.printerCommand: select-url

XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;W: print(noAttrs, noNewLine)
</code></pre></div><p>Now when you press shift-ctrl-W, any URL shown in the terminal will open in the browser. You don’t
have to select anything or use your mouse at all, nice!</p>
<p>Someday it would be great to improve <code>select-url</code> to also scan for email addresses. Maybe during the
next pandemic…</p>
<h2 id="peeking-at-the-alternate-screen">Peeking at the Alternate Screen</h2>
<p>Sometimes you open a fullscreen application like vim or a man page and you need to refer back to
some text on the shell. Use this keybind to toggle back and forth:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;H: set-altscreen(toggle)
</code></pre></div><p>You can even use it view a previously opened vim or man page after you close out of it!</p>
<h2 id="opening-new-terminals-at-the-current-directory">Opening New Terminals at the Current Directory</h2>
<p>There’s a keybind action called <code>spawn-new-terminal()</code> that can be used for this, but even better is
using <a href="https://github.com/schischi/xcwd">xcwd</a> to get the working directory of any currently focused
window. Then you can put this in your i3 config for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">bindsym $mod+Return exec --no-startup-id cd "`xcwd`" &amp;&amp; xterm
</code></pre></div><h2 id="wish-list">Wish List</h2>
<p>XTerm is missing a few small features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text reflow when the terminal is resized.</li>
<li>Fallback fonts don’t seem to always work. Maybe I’m missing a config option?</li>
<li>Transparency not natively supported. I don’t care about transparency but maybe it’s important to
some people.</li>
<li>Occasionally strange flickering with <a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom">picom</a>, possibly a bug
with picom?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end this wasn’t enough to stop me from using xterm, but the lack of text reflow still irks me
from time to time. Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with xterm after taking the time to
configure it.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to ScheerPost</p>



<p>Shortly after WikiLeaks released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/irq/">the Iraq War Logs</a> in October 2010, which documented numerous US war crimes — including video images of the gunning down of two Reuters journalists and 10 other unarmed civilians in <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">the Collateral Murder video</a>, the routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, the covering up of thousands of civilian deaths and the killing of nearly 700 civilians that had approached too closely to US checkpoints — the towering civil rights attorneys Michael Ratner and Len Weinglass, who had defended Daniel Ellsberg in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.archives.gov/research/pentagon-papers" target="_blank">Pentagon Papers</a> case, met Julian Assange in a studio apartment in Central London, according to <a href="https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/moving-the-bar/">Ratner’s newly released memoir “Moving the Bar”</a>.</p>



<p>Assange had just returned to London from Sweden where he had attempted to create the legal framework to protect WikiLeaks’ servers in Sweden.&nbsp; Shortly after his arrival in Stockholm, his personal bank cards were blocked.&nbsp; He had no access to funds and was dependent on supporters.&nbsp; Two of these supporters were women with whom he had consensual sex.&nbsp; As he was preparing to leave, the Swedish media announced that he was wanted for questioning about allegations of rape. The women, who never accused Assange of rape, wanted him to take an STD test.&nbsp; They had approached the police about compelling him to comply. “I did not want to put any charges on Julian Assange,” texted one of them on August 20 while she was still at the police station, but “the police were keen on getting their hands on him.” She said she felt “railroaded by the police.” Within 24 hours the chief prosecutor of Stockholm took over the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; He dropped the rape accusation, stating “I don’t believe there is any reason to suspect that he has committed rape.” Assange, although not charged with a crime, cancelled his departure and remained in Sweden for another five weeks to cooperate with the investigation.&nbsp; A special prosecutor, Marianne Ny, was appointed to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct.&nbsp; Assange was granted permission to leave the country.&nbsp; He flew to Berlin.&nbsp; When Assange arrived in Berlin three encrypted laptops with documents detailing US war crimes had disappeared from his luggage.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We consider the Swedish allegations a distraction,” Ratner told Assange, according to his memoir. “We’ve read the police reports, and we believe the authorities don’t have a case. We’re here because in our view you are in much more jeopardy in the US Len [Weinglass] can explain why.”</p>



<p>Assange, Ratner recalled, remained silent.</p>



<p> “WikiLeaks and you personally are facing a battle that is both legal and political,” Weinglass told Assange. “As we learned in the Pentagon Papers case, the US government doesn’t like the truth coming out. And it doesn’t like to be humiliated. No matter if it’s Nixon or Bush or Obama, Republican or Democrat in the White House. The US government will try to stop you from publishing its ugly secrets. And if they have to destroy you and the First Amendment and the rights of publishers with you, they are willing to do it. We believe they are going to come after WikiLeaks and you, Julian, as the publisher.”</p>



<p>“Come after me for what?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“Espionage,” Weinglass continued, according to the memoir. “They’re going to charge Bradley Manning with treason under the Espionage Act of 1917. We don’t think it applies to him because he’s a whistleblower, not a spy. And we don’t think it applies to you either because you are a publisher. But they are going to try to force Manning into implicating you as his collaborator. That’s why it’s crucial that WikiLeaks and you personally have an American criminal lawyer to represent you.”</p>



<p>Ratner and Weinglass laid out potential scenarios.</p>



<p>“The way it could happen,” Ratner said, “is that the Justice Department could convene a secret grand jury to investigate possible charges against you. It would probably be in northern Virginia, where everyone on the jury would be a current or retired CIA employee or have worked for some other part of the military-industrial complex. They would be hostile to anyone like you who’d published US government secrets. The grand jury could come up with a sealed indictment, issue a warrant for your arrest, and request extradition.”</p>



<p>“What happens if they extradite me?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“They fly you to where the indictment is issued,” Weinglass told Assange. “Then they put you into some hellhole in solitary, and you get treated like Bradley Manning. They put you under what they call special administrative measures, which means you probably would not be allowed communication with anyone. Maybe your lawyer could go in and talk to you, but the lawyer couldn’t say anything to the press.”</p>



<p> “And it’s very, very unlikely that they would give you bail,” Ratner added.</p>



<p>“Is it easier to extradite from the UK or from Sweden?” asked Sarah Harrison, who was at the meeting.</p>



<p> “We don’t know the answer to that,” Ratner replied. “My guess is that you would probably have the most support and the best legal team in a bigger country like the UK In a smaller country like Sweden, the US can use its power to pressure the government, so it would be easier to extradite you from there. But we need to consult with a lawyer who specializes in extradition.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Assange’s British lawyer, also at the meeting, proposed that Assange return to Sweden for further questioning.</p>



<p>“I don’t think that’s wise,” Weinglass said, “unless the Swedish government guarantees that Julian will not be extradited to another country because of his publishing work.”</p>



<p>“The problem is that Sweden doesn’t have bail,” Ratner explained. “If they put you in jail in Stockholm and the US pressures the government to extradite you, Sweden might send you immediately to the US and you’d never see the light of day again. It’s far less risky to ask the Swedish prosecutor to question you in London.”</p>

<hr>



<p>The US government’s determination to extradite Assange and imprison him for life, despite the fact that Assange is not a US citizen and WikiLeaks is not a US based publication, Ratner understood from the start, will be unwavering and relentless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 132-page <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USA-v-Assange-judgment-040121.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> (pdf) issued today in London by Judge Vanessa Baraitser of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court the court refused to grant an extradition request only because of the barbarity of the conditions under which Assange would be held while imprisoned in the US.</p>



<p>“Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at [Her Majesty’s Prison] Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr. Assange from finding a way to commit suicide,” said Baraitser, “and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.”</p>



<p>Assange is charged with violating 17 counts of the Espionage Act, along with an attempt to hack into a government computer.&nbsp; Each of the 17 counts carries a potential sentence of 10 years. The additional charge that Assange conspired to hack into a government computer has a maximum sentence of five years. The judge ominously accepted all of the charges leveled by US prosecutors against Assange — that he violated the Espionage Act by releasing classified information and was complicit in assisting his source, Chelsea Manning, in the hacking of a government computer. It is a very, very dangerous ruling for the media. And if, on appeal, and the US has already said it would appeal, the higher court is assured that Assange will be held in humane conditions, it paves the way for his extradition.</p>



<p>The publication of classified documents is not yet a crime in the United States. If Assange is extradited and convicted, it will become one. The extradition of Assange would mean the end of journalistic investigations into the inner workings of power. It would cement into place a terrifying global, corporate tyranny under which borders, nationality and law mean nothing. Once such a legal precedent is set, any publication that publishes classified material, from The New York Times to an alternative website, will be prosecuted and silenced.</p>



<p>Assange has done more than any contemporary journalist or publisher to expose the inner workings of empire and the lies and crimes of the US ruling elite.&nbsp; The deep animus towards Assange, as fierce within the Democratic Party as the Republican Party, and the cowardice of the media and watchdog groups such as PEN to defend him, mean that all he has left are courageous attorneys, such as Ratner, activists, who protested outside the court, and those few voices of conscience willing to become pariahs in his defense. </p>



<p>Ratner’s memoir, which is a profile in courage of the many dissidents, including Assange, he valiantly defended, is also a profile of courage of one of the greatest civil rights attorneys of our era. There are few people I respect more than Michael Ratner, who I accompanied to visit Assange when he was trapped in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. His memoir is not only about his lifelong fight against racial injustice, a rising corporate totalitarianism, and the crimes of empire, but is a sterling example of what it means to live the moral life.</p>



<p>Assange earned the eternal enmity of the Democratic Party establishment by publishing 70,000 hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee and senior Democratic officials. The emails were copied from the accounts of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. The Podesta emails exposed the donation of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation by Saudi Arabia …</p></div></div>

</figure><h3>Decision Taken at Highest Levels of CCP</h3><p>Meanwhile, sources have said the development is a proof of China's resolve to nationalize Alibaba. Song Qing, Internet finance industry insider, said the investigation is part of CCP plans to nationalize both Ant Group and Alibaba. "There will definitely be an outcome, now that they have started the investigation ... This is probably coming from the highest levels," he told Radio Free Asia.</p><p>The suggestions are that the plan to nationalize Alibaba has come from the very top of the ruling Communist Party structure. A few days ago, the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the CCP, said the government's "anti-monopoly work" will lead to "better development." The paper said the party Politburo thought 'anti-monopoly work' should be strengthened to prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.</p><p>Song Qing agrees with the view. "Just a couple of weeks ago, they set out plans to nationalize Ant Group and Alibaba; the timing was deliberate ... Those plans all came from the central leadership," he said.</p>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>upper_bound</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>    lower_bound    │     upper_bound</span>
<span>───────────────────┼────────────────────</span>
<span>1.2511263318488451 │ 7.4155403348178215</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The range we defined is one standard deviation from the mean. Any value outside this range is considered an anomaly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WITH</span> <span>series</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span>
       <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>

January 11, 2021 | https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/decentralized-wishlist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/decentralized-wishlist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
  Social networks are usually run by single central organizations.
  When you visit <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, for example, your computer talks to servers located in giant datacenters owned by a company called “Facebook, Inc.”.
  In addition to running all the servers and networking equipment, Facebook, Inc. also does things like control who’s allowed to use the website, pick trending topics, and tweak the algorithm that decides what shows up in your feed.
</p>
<p>
  Lately, though, there’s been some interest in <em>decentralized social networks</em>.
  These systems let lots of different people and groups run parts of the service.
  (Often, they’re set up so that anyone can join in just by running a special program on their computer.)
  I’ve been seeing projects like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>,  and <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a> get released and slowly gain in popularity over the past few years. If you want to stretch the definition of “social network”, there’s also <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>, and <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These kinds of projects are exciting to me because they could solve a lot of the problems with social networks.
  It’s a lot harder for decentralized networks to go down, or make user-hostile changes, or submit to pressure from authoritarian regimes.
  They’re also kind of cool from a technical perspective.
  Despite all this, I haven’t found a project that I personally want to use or recommend to people yet—every decentralized social network I’ve looked at is missing something or other.
</p>
<p>
  I think I’ve managed to boil down the things I want to see in a decentralized network into three key features:
</p>
<h2>Network-layer anonymity (like <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> or <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">Tor Onion Services</a>)</h2>
<p>
  When your computer talks to a website, that website receives your IP address.
  There’s a very good technical reason for this: if you ask the website to send you some information, the website needs to know where to send it.
  (A bit like a return address on a letter.)
  But IP addresses can also reveal information about you.
  They usually indicate roughly where you live and who your Internet Service Provider is, and they can be used to connect multiple online accounts/posts/views back to the same person.
  Hackers can also use your IP address to send things like DDOS attacks your way.
  On centralized networks, though, this isn’t the biggest problem in the world—Facebook already has lots of information about you, and they probably aren’t going to DDOS their own users.
</p>
<p>
  But in some decentralized social networks, <em>random other users of the network</em> get your IP address and can link it to your activity.
  They can build websites like <a href="https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/">iknowwhatyoudownload.com</a>, which lets you look up anyone’s BitTorrent activity if you know their IP address.
  These random people aren’t even bound by the flimsy privacy policies and PR considerations that Facebook is—they can do whatever they want with the information.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, there are techniques that decentralized networks can use to avoid this.
  I’m not an expert on the subject, but systems like I2P or Tor seem to work by sending data through multiple other nodes in the network before it reaches its final destination.
  You can use encryption to make sure none of the intermediate nodes can see the data, and you can make sure that the destination only knows who the last intermediate node is and not who the original sender is.
</p><p>
  This doesn’t mean that the actual posts or users of the service have to be anonymous—you can definitely implement things like user profiles.
  It just means not leaking users’ IP addresses.
</p>
<h2>Grassroots content delivery (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Hosting data on the Internet isn’t free.
  You have to buy hard drives, and you have to pay for electricity and Internet access.
  Usually, whoever owns the website pays to host it; I spend a few dollars each month from my salary, and Facebook spends tens of millions of dollars that they get from <strike>secret backroom deals with the Illuminati</strike> advertising.
  But the whole point of decentralization is that no single person or company owns the website!
  So who pays for it?
</p>
<p>
  Some decentralized networks try to solve this problem with cryptocurrency schemes, but this means that anyone who wants to try out the network has to put their credit card information into a sketchy website and transfer money to a sketchy offshore bank account and do other sketchy cryptocurrency stuff.
  (Also, cryptocurrencies are usually outright scams.)
  Other decentralized networks have “instances” which one person pays for and a bunch of other people can use.
  But instances have a single point of failure: if the person who runs the instance decides to shut it down, all of the accounts and posts and stuff on that instance are gone forever.
</p>
<p>
  The solution I like the best is to let anyone host anything they want.
  If Bob really likes my posts and want to help keep them online, he can set up his own little server and copy all my posts to it.
  Then, when someone wants to view my posts, their computer will search for anyone who has them and ask for a copy.
  Could be me, could be Bob, could be the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.
  Their computer downloads the posts and uses cryptographic hashes/signatures to make sure no one tampered with them.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of “grassroots” system has some huge advantages.
  Posts that are more popular will get hosted more; if lots of people want to see something, there’ll be lots of network bandwidth available to show it to them.
  And all it takes is one person who cares to keep something alive on the network, even if the person who originally created it isn’t around anymore.
</p>
<h2>Customizable moderation (like <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists">uBlock Origin</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Social networks need some kind of moderation to make sure your feed isn’t filled with spam, or viruses, or other harmful content.
  Companies like Facebook handle this in two ways: by developing machine-learning algorithms to try and automatically detect bad stuff, and by hiring huge teams of human moderators to try and detect it manually.
  But both machine-learning algorithms and people make mistakes sometimes.
  And even if they don’t, they’re still a single point of failure—if Facebook, Inc. goes out of business, or doesn’t speak your language, or decides it’s not worth allowing memes that upset the Chinese government, you’re kind of outta luck.
</p>
<p>
  It might be tempting to try and solve these issues by going in the complete opposite direction: no moderation whatsoever.
  But then you’re stuck with the original problem of your feed being filled with harmful content!
  If a totally unmoderated platform isn’t overrun with spam yet, that just means it isn’t popular enough for spammers to notice it.
</p>
<p>
  Ad blockers are faced with a similar problem, and they’ve found a very good middle-ground solution.
  If you open uBlock Origin’s settings page, there’s a “Filter lists” tab where you can choose which people’s rules to use.
  (Each rule is the name of one specific website or advertisement to block.)
  There are some filter lists that almost everyone uses, like <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList and EasyPrivacy</a>, and there are some that are more niche or regional, like <a href="https://github.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists">Frellwit’s Swedish Filter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/olegwukr/polish-privacy-filters" lang="pl">Oficjalne polskie filtry przeciwko alertom o Adblocku</a>.
  You can also write your own rules, both to block things that EasyList missed and to <em>un</em>-block things that EasyList blocked by mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Content moderation on a social network could work in a very similar way, with different groups of moderators creating different lists of banned users and deleted posts.
  You could have lists almost everyone uses that block things like spam, and you could also have lists for more controversial stuff like adult content and criticism of the Chinese government.
  And sort of like how “shared blocklists” work on Twitter, smaller groups could create their own lists of users and posts to ban.
</p>
<p>
  But if someone really needed to see a post that had been deleted by a moderator—like if they were worried it contained their personal information or threats against them—they could manually override that block.
  (They’d be able to see it, but it wouldn’t affect anyone else.)
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Put together, I think these three features would be really powerful for a decentralized social network.
  If you know of a project that offers all three of these, or you’re working on one, please let me know by emailing <a href="mailto:carter.sande@duodecima.technology">carter<wbr>.sande@<wbr>duodecima<wbr>.technology</a>.
  I’d be really excited to hear about it and try it out for myself!
  And hopefully, lots of other people would be too.

<p>Do you feel your database is growing too big or too old? Hard to maintain? Well, I hope I might be able to help you a bit with that. The text you’re about to read is a real life experience of scaling a monolith database to be able to support a top 250-website (according to <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a>). At the moment of writing this article, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a> ranked <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a> at 215th place in the world. We’ve got over 4M unique daily users and over 7B queries hitting all our MySQL databases combined. Went from under 1M unique users a day a year ago to 1.3M in March, to over 4M at the moment, with over 8M games played each day. I know it’s no where near the biggest players on the market, but our experience could help you “fix” your monolith database, and scale it to new heights.</p>



<p>Disclosure: <em>This is my first ever article, and it’s too long as it is – but I had to cut probably as much text as you see here in order to make it actually readable. So, some things might be confusing or not well explained, and I’m sorry for that. Hit me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and we can get into a deeper discussion.</em></p>



<p>Update: after reading a lot of comments, I’d like to add/clarify a few things. We do use caching, extensively. If we didn’t we wouldn’t survive a day. We do use Redis, often pushing it to its extremes. We’ve tested MongoDB and Vitess, but they didn’t do it for us. </p>



<h2>The state in which we were just couple of years ago</h2>



<p>Somewhere mid-2019 we’ve started noticing that our main DB cluster is slowly growing a bit too big. We had three smaller and less used databases on the side, but everything was always added to the main one. Surprisingly, it was in a fairly decent state for a database that started its life over 12 years ago. Not many unused/redundant indexes, the ones that were there were mostly good. We constantly monitored and improved heavy/slow queries. A nice chunk of data was denormalized, as well. No foreign keys, many things were done in the code itself (filtering, sorting, etc, to make sure the DB only ever uses the most efficient indexes) running on the latest version of MySQL, etc, etc. It wasn’t neglected and it evolved over time into something that did a good job for us. </p>



<p>Disclaimer: I’m not recommending anyone to do these sorts of micro-optimizations. They are working for chess.com, on its scale. We benchmark almost anything we’ve never done before, and see how it turns out, before actually implementing it. We know these work <strong>for us</strong>.</p>



<div>
<p>The biggest problem we were facing at that point in time was that altering almost any table required taking half the hosts out of rotation, run the alter there, put it back in rotation, alter the other half, put them back in. We had to do it off-peak, as taking half the hosts out during the peak time would probably result in the other half crashing. As the website was growing, old features got new improvements, so we had to run alters a lot (if you’re in the business, you know how it goes). Altering would’ve been far less stressful if we could could pull just a small set of tables out of rotation, instead of the entire DB. So, we created a 5 year plan for our main cluster (and boy, were we wrong about our timeline), in which we were to split the database into many smaller ones, and that would make things easier to maintain (we were right about this, at least). The plan assumed ~25% yearly growth, which was what we were seeing in previous years.</p>

<h2>The REAL problem appears and our plan implodes</h2>



<p>You’re all familiar with COVID-19, and how all of that went. Guess what – we weren’t really ready (or we didn’t expect it to have the impact it had on or traffic). Interest in chess exploded when (most of) Europe went into a lockdown. Fun fact – we could tell which country went into a lockdown just by looking at our registrations by country – it was so clear. And numbers skyrocketed across the board. Funnily enough, all our databases were doing fine (not great, but they handled the traffic). But at the same time we noticed that our “reports” host was constantly struggling to keep up with the production hosts (i.e., it was often 30-60 seconds behind on replication), which prompted us to analyse our replication stream and its remaining capacity. And it was close to being full, at peak traffic reaching over 95% of the capacity. At that point we knew that USA (where most of our players are from) would also go into a lock down, soon, and that would mean that our replicas wouldn’t be able to keep up with all the writes going to the master (or even if we just keep growing slowly). This would mean the end of <a href="http://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a>, as the code isn’t ready to handle big replication delays when reading data from replicas, and sending all the selects to master would take it down. That made our goal clear: decrease number of writes going to the main cluster, and do it as quickly as possible! This was actually part of our aforementioned plan, but that plan stretched over 5 years. Now we had just one or two months to do that. </p>



<h2>The solution</h2>



<p>How to decrease number of writes to a single DB? Sounds simple – identify tables that are written the most and rip them away from the DB. That way the number of writes handled remains the same, but they are just split into two separate streams. These can be either tables that get a lot of inserts, or not as many inserts, but with records that are frequently updated. Store them elsewhere. How to do it with no downtime? As you’d imagine – not really that simple. </p>



<p>We first identified all the tables that had most updates (inserts, deletes or updates). Most of them were nicely grouped together based on the feature for which they were used (most of game related tables would be written at a similar pace, etc), and we managed to gather a list of 10-15 tables, for 3 different website features. As soon as we started investigating them, another problem was revealed – since we can’t “join” between databases on different hosts, we would need to move as many tables as the feature used to make the project simpler (we were already aware of this, since when “the plan” first came into place, we did something similar for 3 smaller, less used tables as a PoC, and it turned out fine). </p>



<p>The 3 features we identified as high-traffic were logs (not really a feature, and not really logs, they were just poorly named), games (like you’d expect on a chess gaming platform) and puzzles. For logs we’ve found just 3 very isolated tables, which meant not a lot query/code changes were required. Similar for games, as well. But puzzles had over 15 tables to move, and the queries on those tables had lots of joins towards tables that were to remain in the main database cluster. We’ve rallied our troops, pulled over half of our backend developers, split them into teams, and started pushing on all of these in parallel. </p>



<p>It took just one week to move logs into its dedicated database, running on two hosts, which gave us some breathing space, as those had the most writes, by far. One more month to move games (which was oh so scary, as any mistake there would be a disaster, considering that’s the whole point of the website), and puzzles took over 2 months. After these, we were well under 80% of the replication capacity in the peak, which meant we had time to regroup, and plan upcoming projects a bit better.</p>



<h2>The execution</h2>



<p>So, how did we do it? </p>



<p>As you might assume, there are two sides to a project like this – code and database, and both require a lot of work. On the code side, there are a few prerequisites for a project like this one. First of all, we need some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature flag</a> (aka feature toggle) system, either internal or 3rd party. Ours is custom built, pretty extensive, and maybe a topic for another post. The bare minimum the feature flag system needs to provide is to allow or deny access to a percent of checks from 0 to 100 percent. Another really useful thing to have is a good test coverage. Our entire codebase was rewritten from scratch a few years ago, so we were lucky enough to have that, as it saved us a couple of times.</p>



<div>
<p>Between code changes and database changes, some things can be done in parallel and some require going by numbers. The easiest thing to start with is to set up the new database. All our new databases pulled from the main one (we call them partitions, and this process partitioning) end up on a 2-host setup (master and failover-master (replica)), but it can really be anything we want. On the partition cluster, we create a new database with identical schema to the one we’re trying to split (just name it according our needs, in this case the first one was named<code> logs</code>). Then a backup of the main database is imported, after which we hook up the master of the partition cluster to be a replica of the main master (this is why we need the identical schema and backup import). This way the new cluster becomes just like any main cluster replica, only with a differently named database. Then it just sits there, looking pretty, replicating traffic, and being up-to-date with the rest of the cluster while we work on the code side of this project.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Before we started working on this project, we essentially had 2 connections open to the database from the code: read only connection hitting replicas and read/write connection pointing to the master. Both actually hitting HAProxy, to get where they need to go. First thing we did is to create a parallel set of connections, where read/write connection goes to the <code>Partition Master</code> and read-only connection to the <code>Partition Replica</code>.</p>



<p><em>Chess.com is written in PHP, so I’ll use PHP examples to illustrate the needed changes, but I’ll keep it pseudo enough so that anyone can understand what’s going on (you’d be surprised how many websites in the top 1k are written in PHP, and how easy it is to scale PHP to those heights. Maybe a topic for another post.). </em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>encryptionExponent</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; "65537"
</span><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>modulus</span><span>.</span><span>bitLength</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; 2048
</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I vacillate between two modes: sometimes I think every scientific and professional field is genuinely complex, requiring years if not decades of specialization to truly understand even a small sliver of it, and the experts<span><a href="#fn5071682221" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682221">1</sup></a></span> at the apex of these fields have deep insights about their subject matter. The evidence in favor of this view seems pretty good, a quick look at the technology, health, and wealth around us ought to convince anyone.</p><p>But sometimes one of these masters at the top of the mountain will say something so obviously incorrect, something even an amateur can see is false, that the only possible explanation is that they understand very little about their field. Sometimes vaguely smart generalists with some basic stats knowledge objectively outperform these experts. And if the masters at the top of the mountain aren't real, then that undermines the entire hierarchy of expertise.</p><p>Some hierarchies are undeniably legitimate. Chess, for example, has the top players constantly battling each other, new players trying to break in (and sometimes succeeding), and it's all tracked by a transparent rating algorithm that is constantly updated. Even at the far right tails of these rankings, there are significant and undeniable skill gaps. There is simply no way Magnus Carlsen is secretly bad at chess.</p><p>Science would seem like another such hierarchy. The people at the top have passed through a long series of tests designed to evaluate their skills and knowledge, winnow out the undeserving, and provide specialized training: undergrad, PhD, tenure track position, with an armada of publications and citations along the way.</p><p>Anyone who has survived the torments of tertiary education will have had the experience of getting a broad look at a field in a 101 class, then drilling deeper into specific subfields in more advanced classes, and then into yet more specific sub-subfields in yet more advanced classes, until eventually you're stuck at home on a Saturday night reading an article in an obscure Belgian journal titled "Iron Content in Antwerp Horseshoes, 1791-1794: Trade and Equestrian Culture Under the Habsburgs", and the list of references carries the threatening implication of an entire literature on the equestrian metallurgy of the Low Countries, with academics split into factions justifying or expostulating the irreconcilable implications of rival theories. And then you realize that there's an equally obscure literature about every single subfield-of-a-subfield-of-a-subfield. You realize that you will never be a polymath and that simply catching up with the state of the art in one tiny corner of knowledge is a daunting proposition. The idea of exiting this ridiculous sham we call life flashes in your mind, but you dismiss it and heroically persist in your quest to understand those horseshoes instead.</p><p>It is absurd to think that after such lengthy studies and deep specialization the experts could be secret frauds. As absurd as the idea that Magnus Carlsen secretly can't play Chess. Right?</p><p>Imagine if tomorrow it was revealed that Magnus Carlsen actually doesn't know how to play chess. You can't then just turn to the #2 and go "oh well, Carsen was fake but at least we have Fabiano Caruana, he's the real deal"—if Carlsen is fake that also implicates every player who has played against him, every tournament organizer, and so on. The entire hierarchy comes into question. Even worse, imagine if it was revealed that Carlsen was a fake, but he still continued to be ranked #1 afterwards. So when I observe extreme credential-competence disparities in science or government bureaucracies, I begin to suspect the entire system.<span><a href="#fn5071682222" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682222">2</sup></a></span> Let's take a look at some examples.</p><h4 id="59"><a href="#59" title="59"></a>59</h4><p>In 2015, Viechtbauer et al. published <em>A simple formula for the calculation of sample size in pilot studies</em>, in which they describe a simple method for calculating the required N for an x% chance of detecting a certain effect based on the proportion of participants who exhibit the effect. In the paper, they give an <em>example</em> of such a calculation, writing that if 5% of participants exhibit a problem, the study needs N=59 for a 95% probability of detecting the problem. The actual required N will, of course, vary depending on the prevalence of the effect being studied.</p><p>If you look at the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0%2C5&amp;cites=8563214002358604992&amp;scipsc=1&amp;q=59&amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">papers citing Viechtbauer et al.</a>, you will find dozens of them simply using N=59, regardless of the problem they're studying, and explaining that they're using that sample size because of the Viechtbauer paper! The authors of these studies are professors at real universities, working in disciplines based almost entirely on statistical analyses. The papers passed through editors and peer reviewers. In <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">my piece on the replication crisis</a>, I wrote that I find it difficult to believe that social scientists don't know what they're doing when they publish weak studies; one of the most common responses from scientists was "no, they genuinely don't understand elementary statistics". It still seems absurd (just count the years from undergrad to PhD, how do you fail to pick this stuff up just by osmosis?) but it also appears to be true. How does this happen? Can you imagine a physicist who doesn't understand basic calculus? And if this is the level of competence among tenured professors, what is going on among the people below them in the hierarchy of expertise?</p><h4 id="Masks"><a href="#Masks" title="Masks"></a>Masks</h4><p>Epidemiologists have beclowned themselves in all sorts of ways over the last year, but this is one of my favorites. Michelle Odden, professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford (to be fair she does focus on cardiovascular rather than infectious disease, but then perhaps she shouldn't appeal to her credentials):</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/experts_masks-097c3b01fdd318edec9f70415bc95d6b.jpg"></p><h4 id="Time-Diversification"><a href="#Time-Diversification" title="Time Diversification"></a>Time Diversification</h4><p>CalPERS is the largest pension fund in the United States, managing about $400 billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qFIcakrlowE?t=4743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a video of a meeting of the CalPERS investment committee, in which you will hear Chief Investment Officer Yu Meng say two incredible things:</p><ol><li>That he can pick active managers who will generate alpha, and this decreases portfolio risk.</li><li>That infrequent model-based valuation of investments makes them <em>less risky</em> compared to those traded on a market, due to "time diversification".</li></ol><p>This is utter nonsense, of course. When someone questions him, he retorts with "I might have to go back to school to get another PhD". The appeal to credentials is typical when fake expertise is questioned. Can you imagine Magnus Carlsen appealing to a piece of paper saying he has a PhD in chessology to explain why he's good?<span><a href="#fn5071682223" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682223">3</sup></a></span></p><h4 id="Feedback-Loops"><a href="#Feedback-Loops" title="Feedback Loops"></a>Feedback Loops</h4><p>It all comes down to feedback loops. The optimal environment for developing and recognizing expertise is one which allows for clear predictions and provides timely, objective feedback along with a system that promotes the use of that feedback for future improvement. Capitalism and evolution work so well because of their merciless feedback mechanisms.<span><a href="#fn5071682224" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682224">4</sup></a></span></p><p>The basic sciences have a great environment for such feedback loops: if physics was fake, CPUs wouldn't work, rockets wouldn't go to the moon, and so on. But if social priming is fake, well...? There are other factors at play, too, some of them rather nebulous: there's more to science than just running experiments and publishing stuff. Mertonian, distributed, informal community norms play a significant role in aligning prestige with real expertise, and these broader social mechanisms are the keystone that holds everything together. But such things are hard to measure and impossible to engineer. And can such an honor system persist indefinitely or will it eventually be subverted by bad actors?<span><a href="#fn5071682225" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682225">5</sup></a></span></p><p>What does feedback look like in the social sciences? The norms don't seem to be operating very well. There's a small probability that your work will be replicated at some point, but really the main feedback mechanism is "impact" (in other words, citations). Since <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t">citations in the social sciences are not related to truth</a>, this is useless at best. Can you imagine if fake crank theories in physics got as many citations as the papers from CERN? Notorious fraud Brian Wansink racked up 2500 citations in 2020, two years after he was forced to resign. There's your social science feedback loop!</p><p>The feedback loops of the academy are also predicated on the current credentialed insiders <em>actually being experts</em>. But if the N=59 crew are making such ridiculous errors in their <em>own</em> papers, they obviously don't have the ability to judge <em>other</em> people's papers either, and neither do the editors and reviewers who allow such things to be published—for the feedback loop to work properly you need both the cultural norms and genuinely competent individuals to apply them.</p><p>The candidate gene literature (of which <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-HTTLPR</a> was a subset) is an example of feedback and successful course correction: many years and thousands of papers were wasted on something that ended up being completely untrue, and while a few of these papers still trickle in, these days the approach has been essentially abandoned and replaced by genome-wide association studies. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Alexander is rather sanguine</a> about the ability of scientific feedback mechanisms to eventually reach a true consensus, but I'm more skeptical. In psychology, the methodological deficiencies of today are the more or less same ones as those of the <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the 1950s</a>, with no hope for change.</p><p>Sometimes we can't wait a decade or two for the feedback to work, the current pandemic being a good example. Being right about masks <em>eventually</em> isn't good enough. The loop there needs to be tight, feedback immediate. Blindly relying on the predictions of this or that model from this or that university is absurd. You need systems with built-in, automatic mechanisms for feedback and course correction, subsidized markets being the very best one. Tom Liptay (a superforecaster) has been <a href="https://www.maby.app/covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoring his predictions against those of experts</a>; naturally he's winning. And that's just one person, imagine hundreds of them combined, with a monetary incentive on top.</p><h4 id="Uniformity"><a href="#Uniformity" title="Uniformity"></a>Uniformity</h4><p>There's a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    
                    <p>The demand for data engineers is growing rapidly. According to <a href="http://hired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">hired.com</a> the <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="3" data-reactroot="">demand has increased by 45%</a> in 2019. The median salary for Data Engineers in SF Bay Area is around $160k. So the question is: how to become a data engineer?<!--StartFragment--></p>
<h2>What Data Engineering is</h2>
<p>Data engineering is closely related to data as you can see from its name. But if data analytics usually means extracting insights from existing data, data engineering means the process of building infrastructure to deliver, store and process the data. According to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">The AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>, the data engineering proccess is located at the very bottom: Collect, Move &amp; Store, Data Preparation. So if your organization wants to be data/AI-driven then they should hire/train data engineers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png" data-image="1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png"></figure>

<p>But what data engineers actually do? The amount of data is growing rapidly every single day. We are contemplating the new era where everybody can do a content from their mobile phone and other gadgets. Even small devices are connected to the Internet. Data engineers from the past were responsible for writing complex SQL queries, building ETL (extract, transform &amp; load) processes using big enterprise tools like Informatica ETL, Pentaho ETL, Talend etc. But now the market demands more broader skillset. If you want to work as a data engineer you need to have:</p>
<ul><li>Intermediate knowledge of SQL and Python</li><li>Experience working with cloud providers like AWS, Azure or GCP</li><li>The knowledge of Java/Scala is a big plus</li><li>Understading SQL/NoSQL databases (data modeling, data warehousing, performance optimization)</li></ul>
<p>The skillset is very similar to what Backend engineers usually know. In reality if an organization is growing in terms of data the ideal candidate to transform into data engineer is a backend engineer.</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<p>The particular technologies and tools could differ due to company size, data volumes and data velocity. If we look at the FAANG for example, they usually require:</p>
<ul><li>Knowledge of Python, Java or Scala</li><li>Experience working with Big data tools like Apache Hadoop, Kafka and Spark</li><li>Solid knowledge of algorithms and data structures</li><li>Undestanding of distributed systems</li><li>Experience with Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, QlikView, Looker or Superset</li></ul>
<h2>Data Engineer's Skillset</h2>
<p>Data engineering is an engineering area that is why the knowledge of computer science fundamentals is required, especially the understanding of most popular algorithms and data structures (Hello Mr. Cormen!).</p>
<p>Because data engineers deal with the data on a daily basis understading how databases work is a huge plus. For example, the most popular SQL databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL use B-Tree data structure under the hood.</p>
<h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
<p>If you prefer video courses I would recommend to look at the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization</a>. I took these courses and think they are quite good as a starting point.</p>
<p>Speaking about talks I would highly recommend take a look at Alex Petrov's presentation called <em>What Every Programmer has to know about Database Storage:</em></p>
<figure><iframe width="100%" height="497" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1wbQPbFZdk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></iframe></figure>
<p>Alex has a great series of posts related to databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-1-flavours-of-io-8e1ace1de017">On Disk IO, Part 1: Flavors of IO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-2-more-flavours-of-io-c945db3edb13">On Disk IO, Part 2: More Flavours of IO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-3-lsm-trees-8b2da218496f">On Disk IO, Part 3: LSM Trees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-storage-part-4-b-trees-30791060741">On Disk IO, Part 4: B-Trees and RUM Conjecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-access-patterns-in-lsm-trees-2ba8dffc05f9">On Disk IO, Part 5: Access Patterns in LSM Trees</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Courses, video presentations are good but what about books? I would recommend the only book by Thomas Cormen and friends called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=74742875db503b1a899ca35159749067">Introduction to Algorithms</a>. The most comprehensive reference on algorithms and data structures. To practice and strengthen your knowlegde go to <a href="http://leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a> and start solving problems. Practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>Databases are great, Carnegie Mellon University uploads their lessons to Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeYBdghaIjc&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi">Introduction to Database Systems (Fall 2019)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdW5RKUboKc&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjasmrEd2_Yi1deeE360zv5O">Advanced Database Systems (Spring 2020)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>SQL — the lingua franca for databases</h3>
<p>SQL was developed back in 70s and still is the most popular language to work with data. Periodically some experts claim that SQL is going to die very soon, but it is still alive despite many rumors. I think we will stick to SQL for another decade or two (or even more). If you look at the modern and popular databases you will see that almost all of them support SQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB</li>
<li>Amazon Redshift, Apache Druid, Yandex ClickHouse</li>
<li>HP Vertica, Greenplum</li>
</ul>
<p>In a big data ecosystem there are many different SQL engines: Presto (Trino), Hive, Impala etc. I would highly recommend to invest some time to master SQL.</p>
<p>If you are new to SQL, start with the Mode's SQL guide: <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/">Introduction to SQL</a>. If you feel comfortable you can continue with the <a href="https://bit.ly/2XrRH4i" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">DataCamp's interactive courses</a>. I would recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-sql?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">Intermediate SQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">Joining Data in SQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datacamp.com/courses/postgresql-summary-stats-and-window-functions?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best resources on SQL are <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">Modern SQL</a> and <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">Use The Index, Luke!</a> Practice makes perfect that is why go to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/">Leetcode Databases problemset</a> and start practicing 💪 By the way, do not forget to read my article on <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">SQL window functions</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Programming: Python, Java and Scala</h3>
<p>Python is a very popular programming language to build web apps as well as for data analytics &amp; science. It has a very rich ecosystem and huge community. According to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a> Python is in the Top 3 widely used programming languages after C &amp; Java.</p>
<p>Speaking about other 2 languages, many big data systems are written in Java or Scala:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Kafka (Scala)</li>
<li>Hadoop HDFS (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Spark (Scala)</li>
<li>Apache Cassandra (Java)</li>
<li>HBase (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Hive, Presto in Java</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to undestand how these systems work I would recommend to know the language in which they are written. The biggest concern with Python is its poor performance hence the knowledge of a more efficient language will be a big plus to your skillset.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Scala, I would recommend to take a look at <a href="https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/">Twitter's Scala School</a>. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981531687/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0981531687&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=69314619f1e546e3921eb97c72cf4850">Programming in Scala</a> by its creator is also a good starting point.</p>
<h3>The Big Data Tools</h3>
<p>There are lots of different technologies in a Big Data landscape. The most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apache Kafka</strong> is the leading message queue/event bus/event streaming</li>
<li><strong>Apache Spark</strong> is the unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing</li>
<li><strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>, the big data framework which consists of different tools, libraries and frameworks including distributed file system (HDFS), Apache Hive, HBase etc.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Druid</strong> is a real-time analytics database</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really difficult to learn everything that is why focus on the most popular and learn fundamental concepts behind them. For example, back in 2013 Jay Kreps (co-founder of Apache Kafka) wrote the paper called <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction</a>.</p>
<h3>Cloud Platforms</h3>
<p>Everything goes to the clouds. You should have experience working with at least one cloud provider. I would recommend go with the <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> which is the leading cloud provider in the world. The second place goes to the <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, the third place takes <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>.</p>
<p>All providers have certifications. For example, the most suitable certification for a data engineer in AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">AWS Certified Data Analytics – Specialty</a>. If you decide to proceed with GCP the right choice is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer">Professional Data Engineer</a>, for MSA is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-engineer">Azure Data Engineer Associate</a>.</p>
<h3>Fundamentals of Distributed Systems</h3>
<p>The amount of data generated nowadays is tremendous. You cannot fit it into one computer. The data should be distributed across different nodes. If you want to be a good data engineer you have to understand the fundamentals of distributed systems. There are lots of resources where you can start your journey into this field:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB">Distributed Systems</a> lectures from MIT by Robert Morris</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB">Distributed Systems</a> lectures by Martin Kleppmann</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPUF5QyWU8O0Wd8QDh9KaM1ggsxspJ31">Distributed Systems</a> by Lindsey Kuper</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449373321/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1449373321&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=e7e0e096aa5761066245eb90965ac849">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> by Martin Kleppmann. He has a <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/">blog</a>. Also if you prefer blogs I would recommend take a look at the <a href="https://medium.com/baseds">series of posts</a> about distributed systems by Vaidehi Joshi.</p>
<h3>Data Pipelines</h3>
<p>Building a data pipeline is one of the main responsibilities of a data engineer. Data pipeline is a process of data consolidation. Data engineer should be able to reliably deliver, load and transform data from multiple sources into a specific destination, usually it is central data warehouse or data lake. There are many tools which can help you build this process. Take a look at the <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/introduction-to-apache-airflow/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> from Spotify, <a href="https://www.prefect.io/">Prefect</a> or <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a>. If you prefer nocode solution <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">Apache NiFi</a> is a way to go.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Data engineer is a team player who is working with data analysts, scientists, infrastructure engineers and other stakeholders. So do not forget about soft skills like empathy, understanding a business domain, open-mindedness etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Back in December 2019, a few months after I started hacking on Google VRP, I was looking at YouTube. I wanted to find a way to get access to a <code>Private</code> video which I did not own.</p>

<p>When you upload a video to YouTube, you can select between 3 privacy settings. <code>Public</code>, which means that anyone can find and watch your video, <code>Unlisted</code>, which only allows users who know the video ID (the URL) to watch the video, and <code>Private</code>, where only you can watch the video, or other accounts you’ve explicitly given permission to do so.</p>

<p>First thing I did was to upload a video to my second testing account’s YouTube channel, and set the video’s privacy to <code>Private</code>, so I can use that video for testing. <em>(Remember, always only test against resources/accounts you own!)</em> If I can find a way to access that video with my first testing account, we have a bug.</p>

<p>With my first account, I started using YouTube, trying every feature, pressing every button I could find, and whenever I saw an HTTP request with a video ID in it, I changed it to the target <code>Private</code> video, hoping that I can leak some information about it, but I wasn’t really getting any success. The main YouTube site (at least the endpoints I have tested), seems to always check if the video was <code>Private</code> or not, and when trying to request info about the target <code>Private</code> video, they always returned errors such as <code>This video is private!</code>.</p>

<p>I needed to find another way.</p>

<p>A great thing to do in a situation like this, is to try to look for other products/services which are not your main target, but are somehow interacting with its resources internally. If they have access to its resources, it might be possible that they don’t have every level of protection that the main product has.</p>

<p>An interesting target which matched these requirements was Google Ads. This is the product which advertisers use to create ads across all Google services, <em>including YouTube</em>. So, the ads you get before YouTube videos are set up by advertisers here, on the Google Ads platform.</p>

<p>So I created a Google Ads account, and created a new advertisement, which would play a video of mine as a skippable ad for YouTube users. During the ad creation process, I also tried to use the target <code>Private</code> video’s ID wherever I could, but no success.</p>

<p>After creating the ad, I started looking at all of the different Google Ads features. The thing was huge, it had a bunch of different settings/tools. I was trying to find anything that could be YouTube-related.</p>

<p>There was a page called <code>Videos</code>, where I could see a list of videos used by my advertisements. Clicking on a video opened up an <code>Analytics</code> section for that specific video. It had an embedded player, some statistics, and an interesting feature called <code>Moments</code>. It allowed advertisers to “mark” specific moments of the video, to see when different things happen (such as the timestamp of when the company logo appears). To be honest I am not quite sure what advertisers use this feature for, nevertheless, it seemed interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-11-stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/ads-moments.gif" alt="The Moments feature on the Ads console"></p>

<p>Looking at the proxy logs, every time I “marked a moment”, a <code>POST</code> request was made to a <code>/GetThumbnails</code> endpoint, with a body which included a video ID:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/aw_video/_/rpc/VideoMomentService/GetThumbnails</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ads.google.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>Internet-Explorer-6</span>
<span>Cookie</span><span>:</span> <span>[redacted]</span>

__ar={"1":"kCTeqs1F4ME","2":"12240","3":"387719230"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where in the <code>__ar</code> parameter, <code>1</code> was the ID of the video and <code>2</code> was the time of the moment in milliseconds. The response was a base64 encoded image, which was the thumbnail displayed by Ads.</p>

<p>I did what I did a bunch of times already, and replaced the ID to my second account’s <code>Private</code> video in the request, and to my surprise, <strong>it returned a base64 response</strong>!</p>

<p>I quickly Googled “base64 to image”, and pasted the base64 into the first decoder I found, and it <strong>displayed a thumbnail from the target <code>Private</code> video</strong>! It worked! I have found a working IDOR <em>(Insecure Direct Object Reference)</em> bug, where I could get a frame from any private video on YouTube!</p>

<p>But I was like “hm, that is just one frame”. We can do better.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a proof of concept Python script which generates an actual, moving “video”. I searched for some calculations, and figured out that if the video is in 24 FPS, one frame stays on the screen for <code>33</code> milliseconds. So I just have to download every image starting from <code>0</code> milliseconds, incrementing by <code>33</code> milliseconds every time, and then construct some kind of video using all of the images I have acquired.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick and dirty POC which downloaded the frames for the first 3 seconds of a video, decoded them, and then generated a GIF. To test it, I have ran it against an old video of mine, which I had previously privated due to, of course, the <em>high level of cringe</em>:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="315px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3bNbYRTxZM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And there you have it, using this bug, any private YouTube video could have been downloaded by a malicious attacker, which to me feels like a pretty cool impact. But of course, it had a few limitations I couldn’t overcome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the real world you would have to know the ID of the target video. Mass-leaking those would be considered a bug on its own.</li>
  <li>Since these are just images, you can’t access audio.</li>
  <li>The resolution is very low. (but it’s high enough to see what is happening)</li>
</ul>

<p>The takeaway from this bug is that situations where two different products interact with each other under the hood are always a good area to focus on, since both product teams probably only know their own systems best, and might miss important details when working with a different product’s resources.</p>

<p>Looking for an IDOR like this can be a very repetitive and manual task, and nowadays I try to avoid just blindly changing IDs everywhere and hoping for the best. After you test a product for a while and get a feel of how it works internally, it might be more effective (and more fun) to try to think about different unexpected actions that the developers maybe didn’t think about based on what you saw already, or focus on features that just got released, or to just do any other non-mindless task. You will probably enjoy it more in the long term. In my opinion, the more you understand a system, the more ideas about how to break it will just naturally come to mind.</p>

<p>But again, even in the most robust and well tested systems, there is the chance that just swapping an ID in a request will get you a critical bug.</p>

We all know that we have a much better chance of getting what we want in life if we purposefully set goals. </p><p>The content available on the subject is downright prolific. There is so much information out there, in fact, that it can be overwhelming to pick a program, make a plan, and actually get into the business of goal setting and achievement. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg" alt="Goal Setting" srcset="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.doit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Goal Setting</figcaption></figure><p>The world is full of overwhelm. Figuring out how to go about setting and achieving your goals is <em>very</em> important, but that doesn't mean it has to be complicated. We aim to make life easier to manage. In honor of simplicity, we have researched goal setting for you and put together an easy-to-follow plan for setting and achieving your personal goals. We even included some tried-and-true tips and techniques that can be modified to fit your unique life. Let’s do it. </p><h2 id="goal-setting">Goal Setting</h2><ol><li><a href="#a-bit-of-background-what-are-personal-goals-do-we-need-them">What are personal Goals</a></li><li><a href="#setting-smart-goals">Setting SMART Goals</a></li><li><a href="#a-simple-system-for-goal-setting">A Simple System for Goal Setting</a></li><li><a href="#do-it-5-tips-and-tricks-for-goal-achievement">Do it: 5 Tips and Tricks for Goal Achievement</a></li></ol><h2 id="a-bit-of-background-what-are-personal-goals-do-we-need-them">A Bit of Background: What are Personal Goals? Do we Need Them?</h2><p>Personal goals are the things we want to accomplish in life. Plain and simple. In a sense, all goals are personal because they are created from within and attached to our greatest desires and aspirations. </p><p>Sometimes they are looked at separately from professional goals, which are specifically related to one’s professional or work life. That being said, personal goals can most certainly take into account goals related to work or career. Here we will focus on personal goal setting and achievement, with the understanding that the term is all encompassing. Make sense? </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Personal goals are unique to every individual because they are, well, personal! Seems obvious, right? Despite that characteristic, it can be helpful to see some examples of personal goals to get started. This can churn up ideas and open the mind to the endless possibilities. Here is an assortment.</p><ul><li>Work out 3-5 times each week.</li><li>Write in a journal every day.</li><li>Fully fund an emergency savings account equal to six months’ living expenses.</li><li>Walk the dog at least once per day.</li><li>Pay off the student loan in 18 months.</li><li>Take a hike 1-2 times per month.</li><li>Travel to a new destination twice each year.</li><li>Cook dinner at home 3 nights per week.</li><li>Fit into my old favorite jeans before my next birthday.</li><li>Stop working full time before 50.</li><li>Train the puppy 15 commands before his 2nd birthday. <br></li></ul><p>You get the idea. Goals can be big, small, long term, or short term. Personal goals can be about daily life, a lifetime, or anything in between. They are unique to <em>what </em>you want, <em>when</em> you want it. Personal goals do have this in common: they make life better, more meaningful, and focused. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We know what personal goals are but why do we need to set them? Isn’t it enough to have them floating around our heads? Experts say, definitely not! Setting goals sets your mind up for success. Making your goals explicit helps to focus your attention, time, and behavior towards achieving them. You will fail to achieve 100% of the goals you never set. And the very act of writing them down could make all the difference. </p><p>In fact, <a href="https://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=news-releases">a study in 2015 by psychologist Gail Matthews</a> revealed that simply writing down goals increased the chances of achieving them by 33 percent compared to having goals that stayed locked inside one’s head. Can your life be purposeful, meaningful, and good without goal setting? Of course it can! But, you have a much greater chance of designing the life you <em>really</em> want by explicitly setting personal goals. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="setting-smart-goals">Setting SMART Goals</h2><p>Not all goals are created equally. You will have a better chance of achieving goals that are carefully crafted. Many experts recommend setting something called SMART goals. SMART is a mnemonic device that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound. </p><ul><li><strong>S: Specific: </strong>Instead of setting a goal to “become wealthy” set a specific goal to “have $1 million invested in a mutual fund by the age of 50.”</li><li><strong>M: Measurable:</strong> The goal should be conducive to metrics. What would it look like to make progress and to fully achieve the goal?</li><li><strong>A: Attainable:</strong> Your goals should be big, but realistic. Aim high but be sure you can hit the target within a specified time frame.</li><li><strong>R: Relevant:</strong> Goals should reflect your values, desires, and abilities.</li><li><strong>T: Time Bound:</strong> Goals should have a deadline that will help organize your efforts and keep you motivated to move forward. <br></li></ul><h2 id="a-simple-system-for-goal-setting">A Simple System for Goal Setting</h2><ol><li>Set one big, huge, overarching goal.</li><li>Set a series of increasingly smaller goals that lead to that big goal.</li></ol><p>Jim Collins is recognized as one of the most influential business book writers of all time. His book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-to-Last-Jim-Collins-audiobook/dp/B0813QCVN9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=built+to+last&amp;qid=1601575446&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Built to Last</em></a> was a follow up to the groundbreaking, and now classic, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=good+to+great&amp;qid=1601575412&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Good to Great</em></a>. In it, he and co author Jerry I. Porras introduced a concept that is now widely applied in corporate goal setting. It’s called a <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html">BHAG</a>, pronounced bee-hag. </p><p>BHAG stands for Big Hairy Audacious Goal and it challenges corporations and organizations to set their sights on a super large, awe inspiring, borderline outlandish goal that will be the guidepost for decision making within the organization. The writer’s use President Kennedy’s moon landing proclamation as a prime example of a BHAG. </p><p>The author’s wrote, “Like the moon mission, a true BHAG is clear and compelling and serves as a unifying focal point of effort– often creating immense team spirit. &nbsp;It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for finish lines. &nbsp;A BHAG engages people– it reaches out and grabs them in the gut. &nbsp;It is tangible, energizing, highly focused. &nbsp;People "get it" right away; it takes little or no explanation.”</p><p>There is no reason why BHAG success should be limited to businesses. That’s why we recommend starting by setting a BHAG for yourself. Think of one huge “clear and compelling” star of a dream goal that you can hook all of your efforts and focus onto. Shoot for the stars! Dream big. Make it “audacious.” Above all else, make it <em>yours</em> alone. Every personal BHAG will be unique, but here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Retire debt free in Costa Rica.</li><li>Become a self-made millionaire.</li><li>Sell my business for enough to set up six-figure trusts for my children.</li><li>Finish in the top ten at the Boston Marathon.</li><li>Compete in three Olympic Games.</li><li>Publish a book that hits the New York Times bestseller list.</li><li>Own a ranch that houses a non-profit animal sanctuary for big cats. </li></ul><p>Write your BHAG down in private and highly visible places. Look at it often. Tell people about it and expect wide-eyed feedback. Your big goal should incite a riot of reactions. If it doesn’t, it may not be big, hairy, or audacious enough. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now that you have one giant goal to rule them all, you are ready to go to step two. It’s time to set a series of increasingly smaller goals that lead to the big one. Think of your BHAG as the final destination. Along the way, you have to cross a series of obstacles. These smaller goals will be the roads, stepping stones, or trails you will take and the tools and skills you will acquire that are necessary to get all the way there.</p><p>In her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Goal-Guide-Planning-Achieving-ebook/dp/B07T3GZX1S/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=your+goal+guide&amp;qid=1601577717&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFMWTdDQ1c5SjAyNDMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NTI1ODExUkxDMTAxUkJFVkRSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MzU0Njg5NjBMUTg2UTFNR00md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl"><em>Your Goal Guide</em></a>, author and goal-setting coach Debra Eckerling lays out a highly detailed plan for breaking a big ultimate goal into smaller goals that will keep you on the path to what she calls “GoalTopia.” She recommends that you first determine the long-term goals you will need to achieve in order to reach your final destination. Under each of those long term goals, you will list benchmarks or hurdles that you will need to clear to achieve those long-term goals. Under those benchmarks or hurdles, you will list tasks you need to take care of to clear the hurdles. </p><p>Let’s look at the debt-free retirement in Costa Rica for example. One long term goal might be to pay off an existing mortgage in fifteen years. Under that, you need a list of increasingly smaller goals that may look something like this:</p><p><strong>The Big Goal: Retire debt free in Costa Rica</strong></p><ol><li>Pay off the existing mortgage in fifteen years.</li><li>Make two payments per month equal to twice the required payment.</li><li>Create and stick to a monthly budget.</li><li>Eliminate credit card debt.</li><li>Pay off the car loan. </li></ol><p>Outlines, lists, diagrams, funnels, using <a href="https://doit.io/why-doit/">a digital tool like doit</a>, filling in a goal worksheet: the format you use is entirely up to you. The important thing is to go through the process of taking that one big goal and breaking it down into smaller and smaller bites that can be accomplished steadily as you make your way. </p><h2 id="do-it-5-tips-and-tricks-for-goal-achievement">Do it: 5 Tips and Tricks for Goal Achievement</h2><p>Making the effort to seriously consider and intentionally set personal goals for yourself is a massive step in the right direction.

January 11, 2021 | https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Haskell is the first programming language we reach for when we build production software systems. This likely seems unusual to anyone who only has a passing familiarity with the language. Haskell has a reputation for being an advanced language with a steep learning curve. It is also often thought of as a research language with limited practical utility.</p>
<p>While Haskell does have a very large surface area, with many concepts and a syntax that will feel unfamiliar to programmers coming from most other languages, it is unrivaled in the combination of developer productivity, code maintainability, software reliability, and performance that it offers. In this post I will cover some of the defining features of Haskell that make it an excellent, industrial-strength language that is well-suited for building commercial software, and why it is usually the first tool we consider using for new projects.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="haskell-has-a-strong-static-type-system-that-prevents-errors-and-reduces-cognitive-load">Haskell has a strong static type system that prevents errors and reduces cognitive load</h2>
<p>Haskell has a very powerful static type system which serves as a programmer aid that catches and prevents many errors before code ever even runs. Many programmers encounter statically typed languages like Java or C++ and find that the compiler feels like an annoyance. By contrast, Haskell’s static type system, in conjunction with compile-time type checking, acts as an invaluable pair-programming buddy that gives instantaneous feedback during development.</p>
<p>There’s a far smaller cognitive load that needs to be maintained when writing Haskell than when writing in languages like Python, JavaScript, or PHP. Many concerns can be completely offloaded to the compiler rather than needing to be remembered by the programmer. For example, when writing Haskell, there’s no need to preemptively ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need to check whether this field is null?</li>
<li>What if fields are missing from the request payload?</li>
<li>Has this string already been decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>What if this string can’t be decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>Will this operator implicitly convert this integer to a string?</li>
<li>Are these two values comparable?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that these are questions that never need answering in Haskell; it’s to say that the compiler will throw an error when you need to address one of these issues. For example, it’s possible that a Haskell program needs to handle values that are sometimes not present, but instead of setting any value to <code>NULL</code>, a Haskell programmer must use a <code>Maybe</code> type, which indicates that the value may not be there, and the compiler forces the programmer to explicitly handle the <code>Nothing</code> value; the case where the value is not present.</p>
<p>Haskell’s static type system also leads to other benefits. Haskell code uses type signatures that precede its functions and describe the types of each parameter and return value. For example, a signature like <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool</code> indicates that a function takes two integers and returns a boolean value. Since these type signatures are checked and enforced by the compiler, this allows a programmer reading Haskell code to look only at type signatures when getting a sense of what a certain piece of code does. For example, one would not use the type signature above when looking for a function that manipulates strings, decodes JSON, or queries a database.</p>
<p>Type signatures can even be used to search through the entire corpus of Haskell code for a relevant function. Using <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoogle</a>, Haskell’s API search, we can search for a type signature based off of functionality we know that we need. For example, if we need to convert an <code>Int</code> to a <code>Float</code>, we can search Hoogle for <code>Int -&gt; Float</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Int+-%3E+Float" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the aptly named <code>int2Float</code> function.</p>
<p>Haskell also lets us create polymorphic type signatures through the use of type variables, represented by lowercase type names. For example, a signature of <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; a</code> tells us that that the function takes two parameters of two arbitrary types, and returns a value that whose type is the same as the first parameter. Suppose we want to check whether an element is in a list. We’re looking for a function that takes an item to search for, a list of items, and returns a boolean. We don’t care about the type of the item, so long as the search item and the items in the list are of the same type. So we can search Hoogle for <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=a%20-%3E%20%5Ba%5D%20-%3E%20Bool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the <code>elem</code> function. Parametric types are an extremely powerful feature in Haskell and are what enable writing reusable code.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-enables-writing-code-that-is-composable-testable-and-has-predictable-side-effects">Haskell enables writing code that is composable, testable, and has predictable side-effects</h2>
<p>In addition to being statically typed, Haskell is a pure functional programming language. This is one of Haskell’s defining features and what the language is well known for, even amongst programmers that have only heard of Haskell but never used it. Writing in a pure functional style has many benefits, and is conducive to a well-organized code base.</p>
<p>The word “pure” in “pure functional programming” is significant. Purity in this sense means that the code we write is pure, or free of side-effects. Another term that describes this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referential transparency</a>, or the property where any expression (e.g.&nbsp;a function call with a given list of parameters) can be replaced with its return value without changing the functionality of the code. This is only possible when such pure functions do not have side effects, such as creating files on the host system, running database queries, or making HTTP requests. Haskell’s type system imposes this sort of purity.</p>
<p>So does being pure mean that Haskell programs cannot have side effects? Certainly not—but it does mean that effects are pushed to the edge of our system. Any functions that perform I/O actions (such as querying a database or receiving HTTP requests) must have a return type that captures this. This means that type signatures like the ones we saw in the previous section (e.g.&nbsp;<code>Int -&gt; Float</code> or <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code>) are indicators that the corresponding functions do not produce side effects, since <code>Float</code> and <code>Bool</code> are just primitive return types. For a contrasting example that includes a side effect, a function signature of <code>FilePath -&gt; IO String</code> indicates that the function takes a file path and performs an I/O action that returns a string (which is exactly what the <code>readFile</code> function does).</p>
<p>Another feature of a pure functional programming paradigm is higher-order functions, which are functions that take functions as parameters. One of the most commonly used higher-order functions is <code>fmap</code>, which applies a function to each value in a container (such as a list). For example, we can apply a function named <code>square</code>, which takes an integer and returns that integer multiplied by itself, to a list of integers to turn it into a list of squared integers:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>square ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">square x <span>=</span> x <span>*</span> x</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>fmap</span> square [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>] <span>-- returns [1,4,9,16,25]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Code written in this style tends to be both composable and testable. This above example is trivial, but there are many applications of higher-order functions. For example, we can write a function like <code>renderPost</code> which takes a record of post data and returns the version of the post rendered in HTML. If we have a list of posts, we can run <code>fmap renderPost postList</code> to produce a list of rendered posts. Our <code>renderPost</code> function can be used in both the single case and the multi-post case without any changes, because composing it with <code>fmap</code> changes how we can apply it. We can also write tests for the <code>renderPost</code> function and compose it with <code>fmap</code> in our tests when validating the behavior for a list of posts.</p>

<p>Through the combination of the aforementioned static types and pure functional style that Haskell has, developing software in Haskell tends to be very fast. One of the common development workflows we employ is relies on a tool called <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ghcid</code></a>, a simple command line tool that relies on the Haskell repl to automatically watch code for changes and incrementally recompile. This allows us to see any compiler errors in our code immediately after saving changes to a file. It’s not uncommon for us to open only a terminal with a text editor and <code>ghcid</code> while developing applications in Haskell.</p>
<p>While manually validating the results of our code is eventually necessary by refreshing a page in a browser or using a tool to validate a JSON endpoint, a lot of this can be deferred until the end of a programming session. Many of the would-be runtime errors a programmer would encounter when writing a web service in a language like Python or PHP are caught immediately and displayed as compiler errors by <code>ghcid</code>. This is a far cry from the need to switch to a browser window and refresh the page after making a change to some code, a development workflow that everyone who has worked on a web application is intimately familiar with.</p>
<p>Beyond the tight feedback loop during development, Haskell code is easy to refactor and modify. Like real world code written in any other language, such code written in Haskell is not write-only. It eventually will need to be maintained, updated, and extended, often by developers that are not the original authors of the code. With the aid of compile-time checking, many code refactors in Haskell become easy; a common refactoring workflow is to make a desired change in one location and then fix one compiler error at a time until the program compiles again. This is far easier than the equivalent changes in dynamically typed languages that offer no such assistance to the programmer.</p>
<p>Proponents of dynamically typed languages will often argue that automated tests supplant the need for compile-time type checking, and can help prevent errors as well. However, tests are not as powerful as type constraints. For tests to be effective, they must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Actually be written, yet many real world code bases have limited testing</li>
<li>Make correct assertions</li>
<li>Be comprehensive (test a variety of inputs) …</li></ol></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking5.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our traveling studio has operated off-the-grid since 2016.</p>

<p>For the first 3 years we tested the limits of our space, and at first, it was difficult to create new things, as we had to make time to learn how to solve the underlying problems. Our boat was not just an office, it was also our house and transport. As for us, we were artists, but also had to be plumbers, deckhands, electricians, captains, janitors and accountants.</p>

<p>Our main problems as a studio were <b>internet scarcity</b>, <b>power management</b>, <b>data storage</b> as well as <b>hardware</b> and <b>software failures</b>. Overtime we found ways to balance work, pleasure and maintenance. Here are some of the lessons we learnt.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power management</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking6.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our work schedule is tied to the weather, as we depend on solar energy to power our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough power for video-editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.</p>

<p>There are times when we must resort to secondary power sources, like our small generator or our engine's alternator, but we tend to prefer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ua_qxjbBTc">wait for the sun to return</a>. Waiting hasn’t affected our productivity, as we don't adhere to strict 8-hour workdays.</p>

<p>We tend to work only in the morning, leaving us time to pursue other interests in the afternoon. In our old life, we found that the 40-hour workweek ﻿<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/" target="_blank">kept free-time scarce</a>, resulting in us spending more for convenience, gratification and distraction.</p>

<p>Computers are generally power-sucking vampires. Choosing different softwares, operating systems, or working from machines with a lower draw (ARM) or even throttling the CPU, are some of the many things we do to lower our power requirements. The way that software is built has a substantial impact on the power consumption of a system, it is shocking how cpu-intensive modern programs can be.</p>

<p>Choosing software designed for low-end PCs is a good solution, it is also possible to throttle processes on your machine by using a ‘throttling controller’. The basic idea is like the throttle in a car, it allows to set the rate at which your system will operate and consume power. Another sure way to save battery is to limit multitasking. Disabling notifications, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/noscript/">scripts</a>, auto-playing videos or using internet browsers without opening multiple tabs at once are some of the many ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>Power consumption is also something to consider when choosing a computer. In evenings, if we need to work on light tasks, we switch to our low-power machines like the <a href="https://100r.co/site/raspberry_pi.html">Raspberry Pi</a>. To illustrate the difference in power draw, a Pi4 uses 2.85 W when idle, while a Macbook Pro uses 6-12 W. Raspberry Pis are backups to our main computers, as they are inexpensive and can run off small batteries.</p>

<h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking1.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Internet access is the woe of any working nomad. Internet is sometimes spotty, and data in some countries is slow, expensive, or limited to small blocks at a time. While circumnavigating the Pacific, we amassed sim cards, pocket WiFis, and have often used connections from businesses on land. Overtime, we found ways to lessen our dependence on internet, and to save on bandwidth.</p>

<p>With limited access, it is important to use online time wisely. Prior to connecting we make a list of tasks that we must do, such as pushing updates and making backups of our data online. It’s easy to get side-tracked on the internet, with websites designed to grab and keep our attention. When checking social media, we disable auto-playing videos and image previews to save bandwidth.</p>

<p>When we have a reliable internet connection, we gather copies of all the online material we will need. We keep offline versions of entire websites, writing guides, articles and even whole sections of Wikipedia. If we find ourselves without a connection, we can still solve our problems by using our offline mirrors. By the way, you can <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/master.zip">download our entire website</a>.</p>

<p>We research our destinations ahead of time to make sure we’ll have a reliable connection when we need it. This means we’ll be spending less time in secluded areas, and more time in city centers near a cell tower or WiFi signal. With some planning it is possible to have both paradise and connectivity, we found such a place in <a href="https://100r.co/site/internet_in_paradise.html#internet">Huahine</a> in French Polynesia, and again in Fiji. Internet access will only get better as far-flung island nations gain purchasing power.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data storage</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking2.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware failure is common on boats due to the hostile environment. Saltwater is the kryptonite of electronics. This is why it is important to backup data often to avoid losing work. There are advantages and disadvantages with all methods of data storage, but I’ll outline the most useful ones:</p>

<p><b>Cloud storage:</b> For a fee, you can back up your data online and sync files from your desktop. This method doesn’t eliminate physical storage as data can’t be synced to the cloud without a connection. Offloading data storage to a centralized service is problematic in other ways, because services have rules and owners and processes which can complicate things. For instance, country politics have made it that Google restricts access to some of its business services in certain countries or regions, such as China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Whatever data you have stored with Google Drive, if traveling to any of these countries will not be accessible. As conflicts arise, more countries can end up on that list. We keep documents we don’t need regular access to on the cloud, with copies on hard disks.</p>

<p><b>Hard copies:</b> Paper is a stable and widely accessible material, unlike digital devices which are subject to breakages and obsolescence. There’s a good reason books and other documents from centuries ago are still readable today. We like to keep printed copies of websites and other online reference materials, such as grammar guides for writing, or language manuals for coding. Keeping data like this means we always have access and aren’t limited to our computer’s battery.</p>

<p><b>External hard drives:</b> A hard drive is the best balance of practical and reliable for storage. However, hard drives are rated for a limited number of read/write cycles, and can be expected to fail eventually. To prevent data loss due to HD failure, it’s a good idea to store the same data across multiple hard drives.</p>

<p><b>Offline databases:</b> Keeping an offline collection of websites on computers or HD ensures constant access, and reduces the energy associated with re-loading them repeatedly. It’s possible to save web pages with most browser by selecting File &gt; Save Page As. To access the page offline, click on the HTML file. Another option is to mirror entire web sites using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">command-line tools</a>. We keep offline databases full of notes on a variety of subjects to refer to when there’s no internet.</p>
<p>For those who need a vast quantity of reference materials, it's possible to setup an <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_does_Internet-in-a-Box_.28IIAB.29_help.3F" target="_blank">internet in the box</a> on your boat. In short, it permits you to browse through the World’s Free Knowledge (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, OpenStreetMap, E-Books and many others) while offline. You can install an internet-in-a-box using very diverse hardware, like on a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/internet-in-a-box-raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Raspberri Pi</a> or on a terabyte HD with a built-in hotspot. This system was originally designed for students with restricted internet access and people in remote areas of the world not served by broadband. You can buy one, or better yet <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/" target="_blank">create a digital library</a> filled with content tailored to your needs. This might be especially useful for sailors who homeschool.</p>

<p>Keeping files on the cloud, on hard drives and hard copies gives our floating studio the redundancy required to ensure reliability.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Software has a big impact on productivity, they need to be reliable and fast. Those that require heavy updates, that have a high CPU usage and that need frequent connectivity to function are problematic for working sailors.</p>

<p>Much of the software on the market is designed by people living on the grid with unlimited access to internet. Tools locking up at sea, asking for a connection to continue working don’t float on a boat. Adobe products are a good example, as they require an internet connection periodically for subscription validation. If away from big cities, you may open your computer in an atoll to find that you no longer have access to the tool you need to get things done. Choosing a tool that doesn’t require a subscription is <b>essential</b> for working nomads that don’t have a reliable connection.</p>

<p>In our first year, we struggled to download the frequent and mandatory 10GB software updates from Apple to release our software on their platform, while on slow Polynesian internet. Processor-intensive software or apps is a strain on limited power and bandwidth, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The way developers write them can affect the power consumption of the resulting product. Chat rooms and bare bones text editors aren’t supposed to be process-heavy, and yet the popular communication platform Slack requires <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/" target="_blank">outrageous amounts of ram and CPU</a> to function. This is because Slack is embedding the entirety of Google Chrome in their app. Making software this way is costly to off-grid users, or those on slow connections, but luckily there are <a href="https://github.com/mayfrost/guides/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES.md" target="_blank">many alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>Our computer batteries should not need to grow ever larger only to support these bloatwares, nor should we need to add extra solar to power them. Just as you would look at the nutritional content of food products at the grocery store, find out how much energy your apps are consuming.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/working3.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Computers are subject to water intrusion and saltwater corrosion, but with some care they can survive in a normal marine environment. We solved most of the problems by cleaning external connections often, and by storing them in a sealed box with some desiccants after each use. The main issue with …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Electrostatic lifters are fascinating devices that have become popular construction projects for experimenters all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA’s recent patent on a type of lifter design has&nbsp; spurred further&nbsp; interest in these devices.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_2" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_2.jpg" alt="lifter_2" width="371" height="268"></p>
<h3><span>What is a lifter?</span></h3>

<p><span> The basic device merely consists of a lightweight (typically balsa wood) frame, to which is attached a wire and a sort of aluminum foil skirt. The photos on this page&nbsp; illustrate this. The wire is charged to approximately 30,000 volts by means of a power supply and very thin wire attached to the corona wire. The aluminum foil skirt is coneccted to ground by a thin wire as well. When the device is powered it developes downward thrust and levitates.</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_1" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_1.jpg" alt="lifter_1" width="540" height="306"><figcaption>Lifter being powered by a 50kV DC supply operated at approximately 25kV. Not visible is the thin positively charged “corona wire” which is strung above, and parallel to, the flat negatively charged aluminum “skirt”.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span>How does it work?</span></h3>
<p><span>T</span><span>he device levitates by creating an electrostatic “wind”. This is caused as the thin positively charged corona wire ionizes the air surrounding it which is then repelled from the corona wire and pulled towards the negtively charged “skirt”. The force of this ion wind combined with the impact of the moving ions on the surrounding air creates an upward thrust. This is essentially how some of the “ionic breeze” air purifiers work that you may have seen in catalogs.</span></p>
<p><span>A well known effect called dielectrophoresis may also contribute to the device’s thrust. This is an effect whereby dielectric material in an asymmetrc electric field becomes polarized and moves towards the larger electrode. In a fluid dielectric medium such as air or liquid, dielectrophoresis can cause a continuous flow of dieletric material from one electrode to another. The more intense the electric field the greater the effect. Dieletrophoresis is consitent with experiemental results shown by encapsulating the electrodes.</span></p>
