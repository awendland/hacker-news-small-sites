  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's 2020. Quarantines are everywhere – and here I'm writing about one, too.
But this quarantine is of a different kind.</p>

<p>In this article I'll describe the <strong>Linux Kernel Heap Quarantine</strong> that I developed
for mitigating kernel use-after-free exploitation. I will also summarize
the discussion about the prototype of this security feature on the Linux Kernel
Mailing List (LKML).</p>



<p>Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel are very popular for
exploitation. There are many exploit examples, some of them include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/607">CVE-2016-8655</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/26/2">CVE-2017-6074</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">CVE-2017-2636</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-kernel-af_packet-use-after-free/">CVE-2017-15649</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2020/02/15/CVE-2019-18683.html">CVE-2019-18683</a></li>
</ul>

<p>UAF exploits usually involve <strong>heap spraying</strong>.
Generally speaking, this technique aims to put attacker-controlled bytes at a defined memory
location on the heap. Heap spraying for exploiting UAF in the
Linux kernel relies on the fact that when <code>kmalloc()</code> is called, the slab
allocator returns the address of memory that was recently freed:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/no_quarantine.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/no_quarantine.png" width="60%"></a></center>


<p>So allocating a kernel object with the same size and attacker-controlled
contents allows overwriting the vulnerable freed object:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/uaf.png" width="70%"></a></center>


<p>Note: Heap spraying for out-of-bounds exploitation is a separate technique.</p>



<p>In July 2020, I got an idea of how to break this heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation. In August I found some time to try it out. I extracted the slab
freelist quarantine from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html">KASAN</a> functionality and called it <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>.</p>

<p>If this feature is enabled, freed allocations are stored in the quarantine
queue, where they wait to be actually freed. So there should be no way for them
to be instantly reallocated and overwritten by UAF exploits.
In other words, with <code>SLAB_QUARANTINE</code>, the kernel allocator behaves like so:</p>

<center><a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/with_quarantine.png"><img src="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/img/with_quarantine.png" width="60%"></a></center>


<p>On August 13, <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/08/13/7">I sent</a> the first early PoC to LKML and started deeper research of
its security properties.</p>



<p>For researching the security properties of the kernel heap quarantine, I developed
two <code>lkdtm</code> tests (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/7">code is available here</a>).</p>

<p>The first test is called <code>lkdtm_HEAP_SPRAY</code>. It allocates and frees an object
from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then allocates 400,000 similar objects.
In other words, this test attempts an original heap spraying technique for UAF
exploitation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define SPRAY_LENGTH 400000

        <span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>
        <span>...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>spray_addrs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"FAIL: attempt %lu: freed object is reallocated</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is disabled, the freed object is instantly
reallocated and overwritten:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000002b5b3ad4 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: FAIL: attempt 0: freed object is reallocated
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> is enabled, 400,000 new allocations don't overwrite
the freed object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo HEAP_SPRAY &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry HEAP_SPRAY
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000009909e777 of size 333
   lkdtm: Original heap spraying: allocate 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: OK: original heap spraying hasn't succeeded
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That happens because pushing an object through the quarantine requires <strong>both
allocating and freeing memory</strong>. Objects are released from the quarantine as
new memory is allocated, but only when the quarantine size is over the limit.
And the quarantine size grows when more memory is freed up.</p>

<p>That's why I created the second test, called <code>lkdtm_PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE</code>.
It allocates and frees an object from a separate <code>kmem_cache</code> and then performs
<code>kmem_cache_alloc()+kmem_cache_free()</code> for that cache 400,000 times.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>kmem_cache_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>GFP_KERNEL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Push through quarantine: allocate and free %d objects of size %d...</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>

        <span>kmem_cache_free</span><span>(</span><span>spray_cache</span><span>,</span> <span>push_addr</span><span>);</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>push_addr</span> <span>==</span> <span>addr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is reallocated at attempt %lu</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
            <span>break</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>pr_info</span><span>(</span><span>"Target object is NOT reallocated in %d attempts</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
                    <span>SPRAY_LENGTH</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This test effectively pushes the object through the heap quarantine and
reallocates it after it returns back to the allocator freelist:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000008fdb15c3 of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 182994
  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000004e223cbe of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 186830
  # echo PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/
   lkdtm: Performing direct entry PUSH_THROUGH_QUARANTINE
   lkdtm: Allocated and freed spray_cache object 000000007663a058 of size 333
   lkdtm: Push through quarantine: allocate and free 400000 objects of size 333...
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 182010
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the number of the allocations needed for overwriting
the vulnerable object is almost the same. That would be good for stable
UAF exploitation and should not be allowed.
That's why I developed <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6"><strong>quarantine randomization</strong></a>. This randomization
required very small hackish changes to the heap quarantine mechanism.</p>

<p>The heap quarantine stores objects in batches. On startup, all
quarantine batches are filled by objects. When the quarantine shrinks,
I randomly choose and free half of objects from a randomly chosen batch.
The randomized quarantine then releases the freed object at an unpredictable moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 107884
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 265641
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 100030
   lkdtm: Target object is NOT reallocated in 400000 attempts
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 204731
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 359333
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 289349
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 119893
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 225202
   lkdtm: Target object is reallocated at attempt 87343
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, this randomization alone would not stop the attacker:
the quarantine stores the attacker's data (the payload) in the sprayed objects!
This means the reallocated and overwritten vulnerable object contains the payload
until the next reallocation (very bad!).</p>

<p>This makes it important to <strong>erase heap objects before placing them in the heap quarantine</strong>.
Moreover, filling them with zeros gives a chance to detect UAF
accesses to non-zero data for as long as an object stays in the quarantine (nice!).
That functionality already exists in the kernel, it's called <code>init_on_free</code>.
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/5">I integrated it</a> with <code>CONFIG_SLAB_QUARANTINE</code> as well.</p>

<p>During that work I found a bug: in <code>CONFIG_SLAB</code>, <code>init_on_free</code> happens too
late. Heap objects go to the KASAN quarantine while still "dirty." I provided the fix
in a <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/4">separate patch</a>.</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding of the heap quarantine's inner workings, I provided an <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/8">additional
patch</a>, which contains verbose debugging (not for merge).
It's very helpful, see the output example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 123, whole sz 65118872, batch sz 508854
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 494552, REDUCE head batch 0 by 415392, leave 396304
   quarantine: data level in batches:
     0 - 77%
     1 - 108%
     2 - 83%
     3 - 21%
   ...
     125 - 75%
     126 - 12%
     127 - 108%
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 79160, REDUCE head batch 12 by 14160, leave 17608
   quarantine: whole sz exceed max by 65000, REDUCE head batch 75 by 218328, leave 195232
   quarantine: PUT 508992 to tail batch 124, whole sz 64979984, batch sz 508854
   ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The heap quarantine <code>PUT</code> operation you see in this output happens during kernel memory freeing.
The heap quarantine <code>REDUCE</code> operation happens during kernel memory allocation, if the quarantine
size limit is exceeded. The kernel objects released from the heap quarantine return to the allocator
freelist – they are actually freed.
In this output, you can also see that on <code>REDUCE</code>, the quarantine releases some part of
a randomly chosen object batch (see the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/09/29/6">randomization patch</a> for more details).</p>



<p>I made <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2020/10/01/7">brief performance tests</a> of the quarantine PoC on real hardware and in virtual machines:</p>

Combined with its 148 minutes of average active daily usage (compare to Slack at 90 minutes) Front effectively has the engagement of a high-grade consumer app.</li><li><strong>Front's 137% net dollar retention demonstrates they are landing and expanding with an extremely efficient bottom-up model.</strong> Compare to 143% for Slack at IPO and 140% for Zoom at IPO.</li><li><strong>Zendesk and Intercom pose a threat because they have much deeper access to customer data. </strong>Intercom embeds itself in their customers' websites, giving them direct insight into the behavior of their customers, while Zendesk serves as a centralized hub for all things sales, support, and/or knowledge management for hundreds of thousands of companies.</li><li><strong>However, Front's high engagement platform makes them attractive to third-party developers. </strong>The more activity Front can promote on its platform, and the larger the variety of integrations their customers are using, the more adoption they'll have inside organizations and the wider their moat—based on the cost of switching away to another email product—will become.</li><li><strong>Expanding across organization opens up the opportunity to "back into" $66B worth of adjacent vertical markets </strong>. While today Front is focused on facilitating third-party integrations to tools like Hubspot, Marketo, and Salesforce, building their own versions of these products would allow them to (at minimum, and per product) 2-3x their average revenue per user—today, Zendesk's Enterprise plan costs $199 a seat, while Front's most expensive plan is just $79 per seat.</li><li><strong>Building their own vertical solutions also puts Front on a converging course with Salesforce ($226B), Microsoft ($1.63T), and Google ($1.19T).</strong> Front's endgame is essentially to recreate the Google or Office 365 suite. But Microsoft was able to overtake Slack's active user count within just two years—a company that had similar ambitions. The threat Microsoft/Google pose and their ability to freely push copycat products to a user base of millions could make it extremely challenging for Front to move upmarket and reach enterprise scale.</li><li><strong>Front's product also makes them an attractive acquisition target. </strong>Rather than attempt to build their own team email product, Microsoft and/or Google could buy Front. That said, Salesforce is the company most likely to acquire Front—both because they don't have any email tool of their own yet and because there's no risk of cannibalization or customer confusion as there would be with a Microsoft/Google acquisition.</li><li><strong>Ultimately, Front’s consumer-grade engagement and ability to achieve org-wide adoption position them well to compete on their own in the cloud productivity space</strong>. Most deep workflow products serve specific functional units (Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce) while products that serve whole teams (Outlook, Gmail) have only superficial access to customer data. Front, on the other hand, is a workflow product and an org-wide tool all in one: a combination that could make them a formidable competitor even to the 800 lb. gorillas of B2B SaaS.

At the time, Front was at $26M ARR growing 5% CMGR6 for a 35x multiple.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we project Front is at about $38M ARR or $3.1M MRR, growing 3% CMGR6.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/731caebc-6ce9-4c26-8451-56f39d4618df_image13.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Applying the 35x multiple from Front’s last round to their current $38M revenue run rate gives us a valuation of $1.3B and an implicit per share price of $11. <a href="https://sacra.com/research/front-initiating-coverage-research-report/access" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full data set.</em></p><p>Slack, for reference, was growing at 12% CMGR6 at the same ARR. According to our model, Front hasn’t grown at more than 10% CMGR6 since the summer of 2017, with growth hanging steady around 5% CMGR between April 2019 and early 2020, then declining slightly with the onset of COVID-19 in March.&nbsp;</p>

Sometimes  that bias  is  greatly  to  our  advantage.  Sometimes  it  is  not.  The  printing  press  annihilated  the  oral  tradition; telegraphy  annihilated  space;  television  has  humiliated  the  word;  the  computer,  perhaps,  will  degrade community life.  And so on. <b>Fourth</b>, technological change  is not additive;  it is ecological,  which  means, it changes everything and is, therefore, too important to be left entirely in the hands of Bill Gates. And <b>fifth</b>, technology tends to become  mythic; that is, perceived as  part of the  natural  order of things, and therefore tends to control more of our lives than is good for us.&nbsp;</p><p>I will close  with this thought. <b>In the past,  we experienced technological change  in  the  manner  of  sleep-walkers</b>.  <b>Our  unspoken  slogan  has  been “technology  über  alles,” and  we have been willing to shape our lives to fit the requirements of technology, not the requirements of culture. This is a form of stupidity, especially in an age of vast technological change. We need to proceed with our eyes wide open so that we many use technology rather than be used by it."</b></p></blockquote><p><b>Presentation: <a href="https://prezi.com/p/egoxlf6-bln8/neil-postmans-five-ideas-to-technological-change/">Neil Postman's Five Ideas to Technological Change</a></b></p><p><b>"The Surrender of Culture to Technology" - talk by Neil Postman </b></p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>I Love It! (I Hate It.)</h2><p>There's a sound of rustling paper. You crack the wrap at the seam. You look inside, unveiling the item within. It's...</p><p>Crap. It’s crap. It’s a crap present that you don’t want.</p><p>You lift your head and, with a beaming grin, you <em>somehow</em> manage to let out a torrent of thanks and praise for what you have just received. This is wonderful! It's just what I wanted! How did you know? I love it! I'll treasure it forever!</p><p>Within a day, it's stuffed in a drawer. Within a week, it's forgotten. Within a month, it's on eBay or off to the charity shop. Worse, it just ends up in a landfill somewhere.</p><p>If you had to guess, how many times would you say this has happened to you when you've received gifts at Christmas or on birthdays?</p><p>Here comes the even worse part: now think about how many times this might have happened with gifts<em> that you have given to others.</em></p><p><strong>Think you've got a perfect record?</strong> Think again, because you really, honestly, probably don't.</p><h2>A Lot of Gifts Aren't Actually That Good</h2><p>In 1993 - to cries of 'Grinch!' - economist Joel Waldfogel published a now-infamous paper (among certain economist circles, anyway) titled '<a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/WaldfogelDeadweightLossXmas.pdf">The Deadweight Loss of Christmas</a>'.</p><p>In it, Waldfogel argues that huge sums of money are wasted every year on gifts that nobody really wants. More accurately, he reported that many gift recipients valued their gifts at a dollar amount much lower than was actually paid for the item.</p><p>For example, if I bought you a gift for $100 and you thought that it was actually worth about $70 it would mean that, somewhere along the line, <em>you’ve destroyed $30</em>. Pop! It's gone. You might as well have just taken your cash and burnt it.</p><p>Waldfogel found that anywhere between 10% and 33% of all Christmas gifts cause this kind of loss every year. This is stunning, especially when we extrapolate out to the entire population.</p><p>He concludes by saying that many people could do worse than simply giving cash as a gift because it would carry more value than the actual gifts they might otherwise have bought.</p><p>Unless you are absolutely convinced that you are god's gift to... well, gift-giving, then you're probably seeing the same loss of value with your own gifts. Or, to put it another way, <strong>a lot of your gifts probably suck whether you realise it or not</strong>.</p><p>You won't see this, though, because nobody is going to turn around and tell you that your gifts were 'only 70% good'. If anything, the reactions that we get with a good gift and a bad gift are remarkably similar. Nobody wants to make you feel like a bastard at Christmas, even if you did hand out some absolute clangers.</p><p>But is it so bad, really, losing a few dollars every year? In short, yes. And then some. But not just because of the money you're wasting.</p><h2>Good Gift Giving Is Incredibly Important</h2><p>Outside of bland analysis by economists that ordinary people haven’t heard of, gift-giving helps us maintain and preserve social ties at all of life’s most important occasions; birthdays, Christmas, Valentine's day, anniversaries, graduations... you name it.</p><p>In between these occasions there is usually some kind of imbalance between the gifts that we have given to one another. That is, you might knock it out of the park one year and I might give you something that’s nowhere near as good. Next time, I'm going to want to do much better. This imbalance leads, in part, to the continuation of the tradition.</p><p>Giving good gifts help to form and strengthen social bonds. It helps us show people how much we care, how much we love them. It helps us say sorry. It helps us convey meaning. It helps us have fun and take delight in generosity. A life without giving and receiving gifts would be a dull life indeed.</p><p>On the other hand, giving bad gifts can degrade the quality of those same bonds. <strong>At best, it can be annoying to be given a bad gift. At worst, it can drive people apart.</strong> If Waldfogel's research is correct, an awful lot of us are unwittingly dropping the ball every year, without really realising it.</p><p>Luckily, it's not just economists giving their miserable analysis of the situation; a handful of psychologists have waded in and they're here to tell you that you're just <em>thinking</em> <em>about it all wrong</em>.</p><h2>Why Our Gifts Don't Work</h2><p>There's a surprising amount of research literature out there that all points in a similar direction as to why gifts don't work and what we can do about it. To find a way through this gift-giving minefield, I've gone through some of the most widely-cited papers to get to the bottom of it all. (Citations can be found at the end of this article.)</p><h3>Gift-Givers and Gift-Receivers Think Differently</h3><p>Gifts don't always hit the spot because the psychology of <em>giving</em> gifts is totally different to the psychology of <em>getting</em> gifts. Although it all happens during the same event, we unwittingly think about these two things in totally different ways.</p><p>When people <em>give</em> gifts, they typically want to nail one or more of these four different things:</p><ul role="list"><li>Surprise (the wow factor)</li><li>Desirability (the clout factor)</li><li>Materiality (the price tag)</li><li>Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)</li></ul><p>Gift <em>receivers</em>, though? <strong>Their priorities are completely different</strong>. They want:</p><ul role="list"><li>Usefulness (can I do something with it?)</li><li>Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)</li><li>Quality (is it well made/going to last?)</li><li>Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)</li></ul><p>Given the difference between these two lists, is it any wonder that some gifts simply don't hit the mark?</p><h3>We Focus too Much on The Moment of Exchange</h3><p>When we give gifts we are mostly thinking about 'the moment' in which we hand it over, seeing the reaction of our recipients. We narcissistically want the chorus of 'oohs' and 'aahs' that come with nailing a really good gift that somebody loves. Whether or not those reactions last any longer than the moment of exchange, though, is not something that gift givers really care about.</p><p>Research shows that we make greater errors with gift giving when those gifts are being opened in public - perhaps at a party - than when we give them in private - such as wedding presents.</p><p>This is because<strong> we end up optimising for the maximum showboat potential of the gifts we give</strong> because it feels good to do so well in public. Once the event is over, though, we basically forget about it all. Onto the next thing.</p><p>Not so for the gift recipient. After the party is over and everyone's gone home... they've still got the gift. It matters much more to them what comes <em>after</em> the moment of exchange.</p><p>This means that it's better to buy a gift that has greater long term appeal than just the momentary 'wow' factor, even if it doesn't feel as good to us in the moment.</p><h3>We Like to Be Given Experiences... But We Don't Like to Gift Them</h3><p>Research shows that an 'experience' gift - like a night out at the theatre or a wine tasting course - is often preferred instead of the usual variety of material gifts that get doled out every year.&nbsp;</p><p>The only problem is that gift-givers don't really like to give experiences as gifts because the moment of exchange is relatively dull. This is usually because there's some stand-in that gets handed over - a voucher or a certificate - and the response is likely to be bland at best.</p><p>The <em>real</em> excitement comes much later when they cash that voucher in. But, of course, the gift-giver can’t actually be there to see that happen. No good.</p><h3>We Care too Much About the Price</h3><p>Gift-givers tend to believe that the more generous or pricey a gift is, the better it must be. This rarely works. For recipients, the absolute quality of the gift matters much more. This is equally true for something that the giver thinks is really thoughtful, too.</p><p>This happens when we put an enormous amount of thought and money into a gift for a friend or relative, <strong>only to find that they have no interest in it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A good example of this might be picking up on someone's love for music and then buying them a beautiful acoustic guitar. There's little guarantee that they have any interest in playing an instrument at all, no matter how expensive it is or how much thought you put into it.</p><p>If they're not regularly playing that thing a year later, you’ve probably goofed.</p><h3>We're Too Distant</h3><p>If you're genuinely quite distant from the gift recipient, it's almost impossible to get a good gift for them that they will genuinely want. This means one of two things:</p><ol role="list"><li>You probably shouldn't bother, or</li><li>You can give them cash (or a cash equivalent)</li></ol><p>Whether or not you <em>should</em> give them cash is another question. If they're your grandchildren this is absolutely fine. If they're your grandparents, perhaps not.</p><p>In the latter instance, a good 'consumable' like a decent bottle of wine or a box of chocolates will do. But don't worry about it much more than that.</p><h3>Be Careful With Charity Gifts</h3><p>Sadly, recipients are less grateful about virtuous charitable gifts than we would hope for. While they're good for the cause, they don't score well against the ways in which we normally value gifts. They make the gift giver look good and they feel good in the moment, but they are not valued as much. </p><p>Of course, if someone tells you that they would value a charitable gift then go for it. But don't assume that anybody will actually like it as a gift unless you have discussed it in advance.</p><h2>How to Buy Gifts People Actually Want</h2><p>All hope is not lost. You <em>shall</em> buy gifts that people will actually want! Here's how.</p><h3>Be Realistic About Your Relationship With The Recipient</h3><p>In Waldfogel's 1993 study, there's a chart of gift effectiveness that more or less screams at aunts, uncles and grandparents to simply not bother with material gifts and to give cash instead:</p><figure id="w-node-9f5a4418121f-c39ae183"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8b192239b9b4843e9ae18f/5fbfe9af234e056f30021f18_GTfsGCvFwKV3s1qidXi6Ls7EIYGoOQBVRr8o_3XvvwZ6IHt4QwNvAaje0p8Il8hWv-Yz1jcRU9A98nTmQMijJOrXU6E6gZC5FSi4_f_WOLuJY2XXZtR2CCIEYZsyAMvYo1P60Hr3.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Are you soulmates, together as a couple for many years? You obviously stand a much higher chance of getting the recipient something they will actually want.</p><p>If you’re anyone else, you will have a harder time and should maybe not worry so much about making sure your gift is as ‘thoughtful’ as possible and just focus on making their gift useful or buying them an experience.</p><h3>...Ask Them What They Want</h3><p>It seems obvious, …</p></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48853"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48853"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront" width="1112" height="242" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1112w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x87.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x174.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x151.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x232.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48853">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48852"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-3-year-partial-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48852"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront" width="1117" height="247" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront.jpg 1117w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-400x88.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-800x177.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-696x154.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-3-Year-Partial-Upfront-1068x236.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1117px) 100vw, 1117px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48852">2020 AWS Calculator 3 Year Partial Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>

<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/11/26/an-update-on-promql-compatibility-across-vendors">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Prometheus's query language <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/">PromQL</a> is one of the cornerstones of the Prometheus ecosystem. Back in our August blog post, <a href="https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/08/06/comparing-promql-correctness-across-vendors">Comparing PromQL Correctness Across Vendors</a>, we looked at several external projects and monitoring vendors that claimed to offer PromQL-compatible APIs. Using an <a href="https://github.com/promlabs/promql-compliance-tester">open-source compliance checker tool</a>, we evaluated each implementation by running a set of test queries against both the native Prometheus server and the vendor implementation. As a result, we found multiple bugs in the tested projects, and mapped out in detail how each deviated from the upstream implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more vendors have entered the PromQL space, while existing projects have worked on improving their PromQL support as a result of our last blog post. Today, we are presenting an updated set of PromQL test results both for existing projects and a couple of new ones. We tested each of these implementations against the latest Prometheus version, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.23.0">v2.23.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores"><a href="#before-we-start-a-note-on-interpreting-test-scores" aria-label="before we start a note on interpreting test scores permalink"></a>Before we start: a note on interpreting test scores</h3>
<p>When looking at individual test results, please note that the numeric scores alone paint a limited picture. They don't necessarily tell you how impactful implementation errors are, nor how many distinct behavioral differences there are. Since PromQL expressions naturally compose and build on top of each other, it is infeasible to isolate all possible query errors into fully independent test cases. Many of the test queries will contain the same constructs as other queries, in a nested way. For example: If an implementation selects data incorrectly, then this breaks not only a simple data selection test query, but also all other test query cases that try to run a function, operator, or other transformation based on selected data. The test cases also include a lot of variations of the same type of query, but with different ranges, quantile values, or other parameters. So if e.g. a function is broken in a general way, it may cause multiple test case variants to fail at the same time.</p>
<p>Another matter of more subtle interpretation are vendor extensions and extreme edge-case behavior. For example, a vendor may choose to not raise an error when executing a function with a parameter value that is illegal in native PromQL, but legal and sensical in the extended language. Or a vendor may return a different value for an unusual edge-case behavior, such as running <code>histogram_quantile()</code> with a quantile value larger than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>We still provide the numeric test scores as a quick way to map out the vendor landscape and to motivate the ecosystem towards achieving a 100% score. But if you need to understand behavioral differences in more depth, please <a href="https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests">take a look at the full test results</a> and read on for the details.</p>
<h3 id="criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests"><a href="#criteria-for-including-a-vendor-in-tests" aria-label="criteria for including a vendor in tests permalink"></a>Criteria for including a vendor in tests</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new PromQL implementations to include in these tests. To include a project or vendor, we look for two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is either advertising full or partial PromQL compatibility of their system, and/or otherwise positioning their solution as a drop-in replacement for an existing PromQL implementation.</li>
<li>For practical purposes, we need to be able to ingest test data into the system and query it back via a PromQL-style HTTP API. Otherwise, we can't run any tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, some vendors failed the second criterium for now, so we couldn't include them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> <a href="https://docs.sysdig.com/en/using-promql.html">advertises PromQL support</a>, but has no <code>remote_write</code> protocol support to ingest arbitrary test data. According to contacts at Sysdig, <code>remote_write</code> may be supported at some point in the future, but we couldn't get a recent update on its availability timeline.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vmware.com/de/company/acquisitions/wavefront.html">Wavefront</a> <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_prometheus.html">advertises partial PromQL support</a>, but they lack an HTTP endpoint against which to run test queries. Their PromQL support is only available within their own user interface so far, which makes it difficult to test against. However, judging by the various compatibility caveats listed in their documentation, we do not expect that they would reach a high test score if we could test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to be able to test even more vendors in the future.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> After publishing, we received questions about PromQL support in two more vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> once <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/promql">started implementing PromQL support</a> (coincidentally with the help of the author of this blog post), but as far as we are aware, this effort has been paused and PromQL support in InfluxDB is neither currently available nor is it being advertised.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-metrics-7-7-0-released">advertised PromQL support in Elastic Metrics</a>. However, the announced feature is only about Elastic Metrics being able to run queries against an <em>existing</em> external PromQL endpoint (such as Prometheus) to then ingest the query result as metrics into Elasticsearch. There is no way to run PromQL on the resulting data stored in Elasticsearch itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set"><a href="#minor-updates-to-the-test-query-set" aria-label="minor updates to the test query set permalink"></a>Minor updates to the test query set</h3>
<p>Since the last testing round in August, we made minor changes to the test query set:</p>
<ul>
<li>For queries that looked at the absolute values of counter metrics (e.g. with no <code>rate()</code> or similar counter-related function applied), we changed the selected metrics to be gauges instead. This helps keep test cases somewhat more independent for a vendor like New Relic, which does not support storing or retrieving absolute values for counters.</li>
<li>We added a query selecting an intermittently present series to test whether <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness">staleness handling</a> works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lets-get-started-updated-comparisons"><a href="#lets-get-started-updated-comparisons" aria-label="lets get started updated comparisons permalink"></a>Let's get started: Updated comparisons</h3>
<p>In this round of tests, we tested the following projects and vendors, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/">Cortex</a> - An open-source, horizontally scalable reimplementation of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/">Grafana Cloud</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://m3db.io/">M3</a> - An open-source metrics engine and time series database.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.metricfire.com/">MetricFire</a> - A hosted monitoing and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> - A hosted monitoring and observability service.</li>
<li><a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> - An open-source project to provide query aggregation for long-term storage and HA on top of Prometheus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timescale/promscale">Promscale</a> (<a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>) - An open-source project to store Prometheus data in TimescaleDB.</li>
<li><a href="https://victoriametrics.com/">VictoriaMetrics</a> - An open-source time-series database and monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at the test results for each of these systems:</p>
<h4 id="chronosphere"><a href="#chronosphere" aria-label="chronosphere permalink"></a>Chronosphere</h4>
<p>Chronosphere does not have a self-service account creation system yet, but they helpfully provided us with a test account with <code>remote_write</code> and PromQL HTTP API support. Chronosphere is built on top of M3 (tested below), so we expected similar test results for the two. After an initial test run against an outdated test environment using an older M3 version, Chronosphere updated our test account and we achieved a test score of <strong>100%</strong> against it.</p>
<h4 id="cortex"><a href="#cortex" aria-label="cortex permalink"></a>Cortex</h4>
<p>Last time we tested Cortex we encountered two minor issues: floating-point input timestamps were <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/2932">not rounded in the same way</a> as in Prometheus, and the system did not <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/issues/416">support executing queries without a metric name</a>. The first issue has been resolved entirely, while the second one is being addressed by a new storage mode in Cortex - the new <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/blocks-storage/">blocks storage mode</a> vs. the older <a href="https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/chunks-storage/">chunks storage mode</a>.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/releases/tag/v1.5.0">version 1.5.0 of Cortex</a> and see what scores each of these modes received:</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-chunks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-chunks-storage" aria-label="cortex with chunks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with chunks storage</h6>
<p>When testing Cortex with the old chunks storage, we can now remove the query tweak to align input timestamps, since that bug has been fixed. Other than that, we still get the same test score of <strong>99.62%</strong> due to the chunks mode not supporting queries without metric names.</p>
<h6 id="cortex-with-blocks-storage"><a href="#cortex-with-blocks-storage" aria-label="cortex with blocks storage permalink"></a>Cortex with blocks storage</h6>
<p>Cortex with blocks storage mode now also does not require any query tweaks anymore and passes with a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="grafana-cloud"><a href="#grafana-cloud" aria-label="grafana cloud permalink"></a>Grafana Cloud</h4>
<p>Grafana Cloud is a new test candidate that <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/metrics/prometheus/">advertises full hosted Prometheus functionality</a>. Under the hood, Grafana Cloud uses Cortex to offer this service. According to representatives from Grafana Labs, they are in the process of phasing out the last (shared) chunks-based Cortex cluster, while all new Cortex clusters are already using blocks as their storage mode.</p>
<p>To be able to cache PromQL queries, Grafana Cloud aligns incoming query start and end timestamps to the query resolution step width (10 seconds in our case). This is currently not configurable on the Grafana Cloud side, so we had to apply a cross-cutting query tweak to align input timestamps to our reference Prometheus server in the same way, to get comparable results.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we tested a Grafana Cloud account via <code>remote_write</code> and their Prometheus-style HTTP query API on both the remaining legacy cluster and a new dedicated blocks-storage cluster, and we got the same <strong>99.62%</strong> and <strong>100%</strong> test scores as for Cortex itself. Since the chunks-mode cluster is being retired this month, we count that as an overall <strong>100%</strong> score for Grafana Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="m3"><a href="#m3" aria-label="m3 permalink"></a>M3</h4>
<p>M3 is also a new candidate in this group that states, "M3 can be used as Prometheus Remote Storage and has 100% PromQL compatibility", <a href="https://m3db.io/">on its homepage</a>. Its documentation also mentions <a href="https://m3db.github.io/m3/integrations/prometheus/">Prometheus and PromQL integrations</a> that include <code>remote_write</code> support and a PromQL HTTP API endpoint. Using these with M3 version v1.0.0, we ran our test suite and received a test score of <strong>100%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For PromQL to work 100% the same as in Prometheus, we had to ensure that our test query was only hitting raw, non-aggregated data in M3 (vs. data that has been downsampled into a lower resolution). We did this by not configuring any aggregation in our test M3 database.</p>
<h4 id="metricfire"><a href="#metricfire" aria-label="metricfire permalink"></a>MetricFire</h4>
<p>MetricFire, a hosted service by the people behind <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com/">hostedgraphite.com</a>, is still pretty new in the Prometheus space. While MetricFire documents how to write data into the system using the <code>remote_write</code> protocol, there is no officially supported way to run external PromQL queries against the collected data using an HTTP API yet. However, MetricFire representatives kindly explained a way to do this. We won't detail it here, but we expect that there will be a documented public HTTP API soon. In our talks with MetricFire we learned that they also use Cortex to back their service, and we also …</p></div></div>

<p>
No Starch Press is publishing a book based on this website in early 2021. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This book will <em>not</em> teach you how to use OpenGL or DirectX; instead, it can teach you how OpenGL and DirectX <em>work</em>. In practice you won’t write a software renderer for production use, but understanding how and why a renderer works will let you use OpenGL and DirectX more effectively.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is a fascinating topic - how do you make <em>Toy Story</em> out of algorithms and some geometric data? Interestingly enough, it’s a mysterious topic not only for the average cinema fan, but also for world-class engineers who just haven’t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Computer Graphics is also a frighteningly broad topic. From 3D rendering to photographic image filters, from fonts to particle systems, there’s a multitude of disciplines that can be categorized under CG. This work focuses exclusively on 3D rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Graphics from scratch</strong> is my humble attempt to demystify that slice of Computer Graphics in an accessible way. It can be easily understood by high-school students, while covering the same topics of an university course. It is, in fact, based on my years of teaching the subject at my university.</p>
<p>There’s little pre-requisite knowledge, nor hardware or software dependencies. The only primitive used in the book is a method that lets us set the color of a pixel - hence <strong>“from scratch”</strong>. The algorithms are conceptually simple, and the math is straightforward. There is some high-school level trigonometry. There’s some basic Linear Algebra as well, but I’m including an appendix that can be consulted as necessary.</p>
<p>This work is divided in two main parts, <strong>Raytracing</strong> and <strong>Rasterization</strong>, which focus on the two main ways to make pretty pictures out of data. The <strong>Common concepts</strong> chapter introduces some basic knowledge necessary to understand these two parts.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is not on performance, but on clear conceptual exposition. The sample code is, well, <em>sample code</em>, written in the most <em>clear</em> way possible, which may not be the most <em>efficient</em> way to implement the algorithms. Where there are different ways to do something, I’ve chosen the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>The “end result” of this work is two complete, fully functional renderers: a raytracer and a rasterizer. Although they follow very different approaches, they produce similar results when used to render a simple scene:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-1.png">
</figure>
<p>While their sets of features have considerable overlap, they aren’t identical, so this book covers their specific strengths:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/comparison-2.png">
</figure>
<p>The book provides sample code throughout the text, as somewhat informal pseudocode; it also provides fully working implementations written in JavaScript that can run directly on your browser, rendering to a <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="why-read-this">Why read this?</h2>
<p>This work should give you all the knowledge necessary to write software renderers. Although in the age of GPUs few people have good reasons to write a pure software renderer, the experience of writing one is valuable for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Shaders</strong>. The first GPUs had their algorithms hardcoded in hardware, but in modern ones you’re expected to write your own shaders. In other words, you’re still implementing big chunks of rendering software, except it now runs on the GPU.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding</strong>. Whether you’re using a fixed pipeline or writing your own shaders, <em>understanding</em> what’s going on behind the scenes lets you use the fixed pipeline better and write better shaders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fun</strong>. Few areas of Computer Science have the kind of immediately visible results offered by Computer Graphics. The sense of accomplishment you get when your SQL query runs just right is <em>nothing</em> compared to what you feel the first time you get ray traced reflections right. I taught Computer Graphics at my university for 5 years. I often wondered why I enjoyed teaching the same thing semester after semester for so long; in the end, what made it worth it was seeing the faces of my students light up and use their first renders as desktop backgrounds.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>
<p>This is a work in progress. Here’s a non-exhaustive to do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texture filtering</li>
<li>Normal mapping</li>
<li>Textures in the raytracer</li>
<li>Shadows in the rasterizer (stencil and shadow maps)</li>
<li>Reflection in the rasterizer</li>
<li>Expand the CSG and Refraction sections into chapters</li>
<li>Linear algebra appendix</li>
<li>Make demos interactive</li>
<li>Clean up demo code</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contribute or to correct mistakes - all the text, diagrams and demos are in <a href="https://github.com/ggambetta/computer-graphics-from-scratch">Github</a>. PRs welcome!</p>

<p>I’m a senior software engineer at Google. In the past I’ve worked at <a href="http://improbable.io/">Improbable</a>, who have a good shot at building the Matrix, for real (or at the very least revolutionizing multiplayer game development), and at <a href="http://mysterystudio.com/">Mystery Studio</a>, a game development company I founded and ran for about a decade, and which released almost 20 games you probably never heard of.</p>
<p>I taught Computer Graphics for five years at university, where it was a semester-long third-year subject. I am grateful to all of my students, who served as unwitting guinea pigs for the materials that inspired this book.</p>

<p>This is not a technical documentation for how I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD. This is a high-level for <em>why</em> I migrated from macOS to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, I was using macOS as my daily driver. The main reason why I got a macbook was the underlying BSD Unix and the nice graphics it provides. Also, I have an iPhone. But they were also the same reasons for why I <strong>left</strong> macOS.</p>
<p>I did not want to write this post right after the migration, I wanted to take my time, use FreeBSD daily, see if I will ever miss macOS.</p>
<p>Here’s a tweet of mine from 8 months ago</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Every 4 months I look at my systems (servers, laptops, desktops, embedded) to see if there's anything suspicious, if anything got hacked, etc.</p><p>man, I did not realize that macOS is that complicated. Why is there a "studentd" running? I don't even use Classrooms :/</p></div>— Antranig Vartanian (@antranigv) <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1234753346600394752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Let’s look at it this way. macOS is becoming less Unix-y every year, <code>date(1)</code> is outdated, there are 100+ Unix processes running by the time the system is booted, most of them are useless for the general user, it has no native package manager (at least MacPorts/homebrew/pkgsrc is out there) and for a power user, there is no proper documentation. Have you ever checked the FreeBSD handbook? Everything is right there!</p>
<p>Okay, the nice graphics part. Have you seen the latest and greatest Big Sur? It feels like eye-candy, it’s not made for power users at all, everything seems to be a distraction now, even the icons. I’m no UI guru, but bringing iOS to the desktop is not for everyone.</p>
<p>So I decided to move to FreeBSD. This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</p>
<p>Every time Apple pushed an updated, my <code>pf.conf</code> and <code>automount</code> configs got broken on macOS. They either got deleted or they moved somewhere. Well, the last 2 times it just got deleted.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD, I upgraded from <code>12.1-RELEASE</code> to <code>12.2-RELEASE</code> and nothing broke, and in case there were any changes, FreeBSD just asked me what to do about them.</p>
<p>Let’s come back for a second. Unix is outdated and Apple does not care about it, fancy graphics are too fancy now. Doing forensics is almost impossible. And the hardware is, well, not the best out there (have you ever disassembled a MacBook Pro? it’s takes 2 hours to change a battery while I can reassemble my Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>So there was no reason to stay here anymore. I had to migrate. The question is: where?</p>
<p>Linux has systemd, not my favorite thing out there, Windows is privacy nightmare. That left me with 2 major options: Linuxes without systemd (Gentoo, in my case) or BSDs.</p>
<p>Since I run FreeBSD servers anyway, I just migrated to FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Here’s a short review about running FreeBSD on ThinkPad T480s.</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi: works. not the fastest, but fast enough.</li>
<li>Graphics: works.</li>
<li>Touchpad: works with multiple fingers AND very configurable via <code>sysctl</code>.</li>
<li>BT does discovery and pairs, I still have to try it with non-Apple headphones.</li>
<li>COVID-19 era: Zoom, Google Hangouts, Jitsi and all other WebRTC-based video conferencing software works via web as well.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/linuxulator-how-to-run-google-chrome-linux-binary-on-freebsd.77559/">Linuxulator</a>, I can watch Netflix as well: <a href="https://twitter.com/antranigv/status/1327422687107555329">here’s a screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, it’s Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>It’s been 1 month and 1 day since I last touched my MacBook Pro, so, what do I miss?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better BT support</li>
<li>Faster WiFi</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it, that’s all missing on a FreeBSD laptop these days. WiFi can do 48Mbps according to <code>ifconfig</code> but I usually get 10-20Mbps. BT pairs with my Apple AirPods but I wish it worked till the end.</p>
<p>Having a nice workstation/laptop is not an easy thing, using macOS means living by Apple rules, Windows is the same for Microsoft. The BSDs gave me the power to be as free as possible :)</p>
<p>During the next weeks I’ll try to blog about the actual setup.</p>
<p>P.S. dear Apple employee, in case you’re reading this, please tell your management to update their BSD Unix layer. Some of us still care, some of us are not just Docker people, some of us are not just “modern” web developers. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p><em>Part 1: How your user experience changes for the worse as the open web gives way to walled gardens</em></p><p>I hang out in two circles. Open web enthusiasts that are lamenting its demise, and regular users who are happy with their fast snappy apps and couldn't care less. </p><p>These groups have a hard time talking because the "open web" too often comes across as an idealistic abstract notion and most end users just don't tangibly feel the bad consequences. In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

              <p><i><span color="#00CCFF"> <img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro200.jpg" width="286" height="208">H.G. 
                Wells wrote a review of the German film "Metropolis" 
                for the </span></i><span color="#00CCFF">New York Times</span><i><span color="#00CCFF"> 
                which was published on April 17, 1927. <p>
                
                Most people find the film (even in its surviving truncated versions) 
                rather brilliant, but Wells didn't like it much, perhaps because 
                he believes it was 'plagiarized' from his "When The Sleeper 
                Wakes."</p></span></i></p>
<p>I have recently seen the silliest film.  </p>
<p>I do not believe it
would be possible to make one sillier.  </p>
<p>And as this film sets out to display the
way the world is going,  </p>
<p>I think [my book] The Way the World is Going may very
well concern itself with this film.  </p>
<p>It is called Metropolis, it comes from the
great Ufa studios in Germany, and the public is given to understand that it has
been produced at enormous cost.  </p>
<p>It gives in one eddying concentration almost
every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical
progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that
is all its own.</p>
<p><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro163.jpg" width="485" height="745"></p>
<p>It is a
German film and there have been some amazingly good German films, before they
began to cultivate bad work under cover of a protective quota. And this film has
been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon taste, and quite possibly it has suffered in the
process, but even when every allowance has been made for that, there remains
enough to convince the intelligent observer that most of its silliness must be
fundamental.  </p>
<p>Possibly I dislike this soupy whirlpool none the less because I
find decaying fragments of my own juvenile work of thirty years ago, The Sleeper
Awakes, floating about in it. </p>
<p>Capek's Robots have been lifted without apology,
and that soulless mechanical monster of Mary Shelley's, who has fathered so many
German inventions, breeds once more in this confusion.  </p>
<p>Originality there is
none. Independent thought, none.  </p>
<p>Where nobody has imagined for them the authors
have simply fallen back on contemporary things.  </p>
<p>The aeroplanes that wander about above the great city show no 
advance on contemporary types, though all that stuff could have been livened up 
immensely with a few helicopters and vertical or unexpected movements. </p>
<p>The motor cars are 1926 models or earlier. I do not think there 
is a single new idea, a single instance of artistic creation or even intelligent 
anticipation, from first to last in the whole pretentious stew; I may have 
missed some point of novelty, but I doubt it; and this, though it must bore the 
intelligent man in the audience, makes the film all the more convenient as a 
gauge of the circle of ideas, the mentality, from which it has proceeded.</p>
<p>The word Metropolis, says the advertisement in English, 'is
in itself symbolic of greatness'- which only shows us how wise it is to consult
a dictionary before making assertions about the meaning of words.  </p>
<p>Probably it
was the adapter who made that shot. The German 'Neubabelsburg' was better, and
could have been rendered 'New Babel'. It is a city, we are told, of 'about one
hundred years hence.' It is represented as being enormously high; and all the
air and happiness are above and the workers live, as the servile toilers in the
blue uniform in The Sleeper Awakes lived, down, down, down below.</p>
<p>Now far away in the dear old 1897 it may have been excusable
to symbolize social relations in this way, but that was thirty years ago, and a
lot of thinking and some experience intervene.  </p>
<p>That vertical city of the future
we know now is, to put it mildly, highly improbable. Even in New York and
Chicago, where the pressure on the central sites is exceptionally great, it is
only the central office and entertainment region that soars and excavates. And
the same centripetal pressure that leads to the utmost exploitation of site
values at the centre leads also to the driving out of industrialism and labour
from the population center to cheaper areas, and of residential life to more
open and airy surroundings. That was all discussed and written about before
1900. Somewhere about 1930 the geniuses of Ufa studios will come up to a book of
Anticipations which was written more than a quarter of a century ago. The
British census returns of 1901 proved clearly that city populations were
becoming centrifugal, and that every increase in horizontal traffic facilities
produced a further distribution. This vertical social stratification is stale
old stuff. So far from being 'a hundred years hence,' Metropolis, in its forms
and shapes, is already, as a possibility, a third of a century out of date.</p>
<p>But its form is the least part of its staleness. This great
city is supposed to be evoked by a single dominating personality. The English
version calls him John Masterman, so that there may be no mistake about his
quality. Very unwisely he has called his son Eric, instead of sticking to good
hard John, and so relaxed the strain. He works with an inventor, one Rotwang,
and they make machines. There are a certain number of other people, and the
'sons of the rich' are seen disporting themselves, with underclad ladies in a
sort of joy conservatory, rather like the 'winter garden' of an enterprising
1890 hotel during an orgy. The rest of the population is in a state of abject
slavery, working in 'shifts' of ten hours in some mysteriously divided
twenty-four hours, and with no money to spend or property or freedom. The
machines make wealth. How, is not stated. We are shown rows of motor cars all
exactly alike; but the workers cannot own these, and no 'sons of the rich'
would. Even the middle classes nowadays want a car with personality. Probably
Masterman makes these cars in endless series to amuse himself.</p>
              <p><span face="Times New Roman"><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro50.jpg" width="254" height="430"></span>One 
                is asked to believe that these machines are engaged quite furiously 
                in the mass production of nothing that is ever used, and that 
                Masterman grows richer and richer in the process. This is the 
                essential nonsense of it all. Unless the mass of the population 
                has the spending power there is no possibility of wealth in a 
                mechanical civilization. A vast, penniless slave population may 
                be necessary for wealth where there are no mass production machines, 
                but it is preposterous with mass production machines. You find 
                such a real proletariat in China still; it existed in the great 
                cities of the ancient world; but you do not find it in America, 
                which has gone furtherest in the direction of mechanical industry, 
                and there is no grain of reason in supposing it will exist in 
                the future. Masterman's watchword is 'Efficiency,' and you are 
                given to understand it is a very dreadful word, and the contrivers 
                of this idiotic spectacle are so hopelessly ignorant of all the 
                work that has been done upon industrial efficiency that they represent 
                him as working his machine-minders to the point of exhaustion, 
                so that they faint and machines explode and people are scalded 
                to death. You get machine-minders in torment turning levers in 
                response to signals - work that could be done far more effectively 
                by automata. Much stress is laid on the fact that the workers 
                are spiritless, hopeless drudges, working reluctantly and mechanically. 
                But a mechanical civilization has no use for mere drudges; the 
                more efficient its machinery the less need there is for the quasi-mechanical 
                minder. It is the inefficient factory that needs slaves; the ill-organized 
                mine that kills men. The hopeless drudge stage of human labour 
                lies behind us. With a sort of malignant stupidity this film contradicts 
                these facts.</p>
<p>The current tendency of economic life is to oust the mere
drudge altogether, to replace much highly skilled manual work by exquisite
machinery in skilled hands, and to increase the relative proportion of
semi-skilled, moderately versatile and fairly comfortable workers. It may indeed
create temporary masses of unemployed, and in The Sleeper Awakes there was a
mass of unemployed people under the hatches. That was written in 1897, when the
possibility of restraining the growth of large masses of population had scarcely
dawned on the world. It was reasonable then to anticipate an embarrassing
underworld of under-productive people. We did not know what to do with the
abyss. But there is no excuse for that today. And what this film anticipates is
not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing
away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.</p>
<p>'Efficiency' means large-scale productions, machinery as
fully developed as possible, and <i>high</i> <i>wages</i>. The British
Government delegation sent to study success in America has reported unanimously
to that effect. The increasingly efficient industrialism of America has so
little need of drudges that it has set up the severest barriers against the
flooding of the United States by drudge immigration. 'Ufa' knows nothing of such
facts.</p>
<p>A young woman appears from nowhere in particular to 'help'
these drudges; she impinges upon Masterman's son Eric, and they go to the
'Catacombs,' which, in spite of the gas mains, steam mains, cables, and
drainage, have somehow contrived to get over from Rome, skeletons and all, and
burrow under this city of Metropolis. She conducts a sort of Christian worship
in these unaccountable caverns, and the drudges love and trust her. With a nice
sense of fitness she lights herself about the Catacombs with a torch instead of
the electric lamps that are now so common.</p>
<p>That reversion to torches is quite typical …</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></div>

<p>In the intensive care unit, patients receive treatment and therapies to prevent them from immediately dying. It’s not pleasant, but it’s true. You don’t want to come see us. </p>



<p>We see the signs and messages. “Thank you, Frontline Workers!” Honestly, it’s confusing. We aren’t your frontline. We are your last resort. And, after eight months, we are tired. Nurses are <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201804-269PS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnt out</a>. Some organizations <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2516043520957565" target="_blank">did not take care of their employees</a> well when COVID hit. Many nurses are leaving their jobs. Most units are experiencing staffing crises. There just simply aren’t enough nurses to take care of all of you. You don’t want to visit the ICU during normal circumstances. You certainly don’t want to be a patient in one now.</p>



<p>ICU beds usually run at about 70-80% capacity. It’s a sweet spot where the unit can function from an operational standpoint while still having bed availability for emergencies or cyclical unit flow. With the first wave of COVID, some ICUs were operating at 200-300% capacity. The bed crisis in itself wasn’t a huge one. A bed is a bed is a bed. Organizations simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19" target="_blank">opened more ICUs</a> in other areas of the hospital. It wasn’t pretty or comfortable, but it worked.</p>



<p>The real crisis came with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/" target="_blank">staff</a>. Who was going to take care of all of these extra patients? Organizations employed many strategies. Nurses managed ICU patients <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aacnjournals.org/ccnonline/article/40/4/25/31008/Answering-the-Call-Impact-of-Tele-ICU-Nurses" target="_blank">remotely,</a> sometimes from other states. Hospitals sought help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://khn.org/news/highly-paid-traveling-nurses-fill-staffing-shortages-during-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank">staffing agencies</a> and per diem staff. Non-ICU nurses were quickly “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rcni.com/nursing-standard/careers/career-advice/covid-19-what-to-expect-if-you-are-deployed-to-a-critical-care-setting-159646" target="_blank">upskilled</a>” to the critical care setting. In short, an already precarious situation just became even more dangerous.</p>



<p>Nurses new to the ICU setting usually go through an intense training program which includes classroom and clinical experience and ranges from three to six months in length. Upon completion of this program, they are still novice nurses and rely on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://healthresearchfunding.org/patricia-benner-novice-to-expert-nursing-theory-explained/" target="_blank">expert</a> colleagues for mentoring and guidance. As crucial as upskilled nurses are, they are still short on education, knowledge, and experience. In our current climate, nurses are working in unfamiliar environments, with a team they don’t know, with fewer resources, fewer experienced staff, and with higher staffing ratios. All of this can and will lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/nursing-and-patient-safety" target="_blank">unfavorable outcomes</a>.</p>



<p>COVID has now been around long enough that we are somewhat in a clinical routine. The patient H&amp;P’s (history and physical) are eerily similar. “Patient attended a family birthday party.” “Patient attended weekly bowling league.” “Masks were not worn.” “Attendees did not appropriately socially distance.” By the time the patient gets to us, they are in bad shape. </p>



<p>They can not breathe without the help of a ventilator. Breathing on a ventilator is very uncomfortable and unnatural. Lung injury in COVID is so profound that patients usually require the most extreme settings, which require heavy sedation and paralytics. If the patient still isn’t ventilating adequately, we will <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKpvGr4KntAhUo2FkKHR_-DwoQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2769872&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mk45rzzxRWxBCOd7Thav5" target="_blank">prone</a> them.

If they spike an uncontrollable fever, we will put them on an ice blanket. We will bring iPads into the room and update families on the phone. The patient will be alone.</p>



<p>All of this will either work, or it won’t. The average ICU length of stay is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/healthcaremanagerjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/Reduction_of_Intensive_Care_Unit_Length_of_Stay_.5.aspx#:~:text=The%20average%20ICU%20length%20of%20stay%20%28LOS%29%20is,an%20additional%201.5%20days%20in%20a%20non-ICU%20bed" target="_blank">3.3 days</a>. The average ICU length of stay with COVID is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01726-3" target="_blank">19 days</a>. Prior to COVID, over half of ICU patients experienced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.posticu.org/" target="_blank">post intensive care syndrome (PICS)</a> after their discharge. This syndrome includes depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits, sometimes limiting their ability to work or care for themselves. The after-effects of an ICU admission with COVID have not yet been studied. Those who don’t get better, will die. In high-surge states, their body will be moved to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201104/el-paso-gets-4th-mobile-morgue-as-deaths-surge" target="_blank">mobile morgue</a> because the hospital morgue has reached capacity. Families will be urged not to gather for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-rites-insight-idUSKBN2161ZM" target="_blank">funeral</a>. </p>



<p>This grim reality is not your frontline. Your frontline is:</p>



<p>Staying home<br>Social distancing<br>Mask wearing<br>Hand washing</p>



<p>If not for you, for your neighbor.</p>



<p>Stop calling us frontline. We are your last resort.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/objects-in-functional-languages | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/objects-in-functional-languages">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's talk about objects in functional languages.</p>

<p>This could be a sticking point, so I'll get this out of the way up-front: I find arguments over whether such-and-such a thing is “really” functional or “really” imperative or “really” object-oriented to be for the most part frustrating and useless. A lot of these arguments boil down to value judgments in disguise (a thing I've touched on in the past when <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/proofs-and-programs-and-rhetoric" rel="nofollow">talking about the rhetorical emphasis placed on math in programming</a>) and many of the rest turn out to be based on informal definitions where 'functional' means 'like my favorite or first functional language'.<sup id="fnref:samp"><a href="#fn:samp" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> I prefer to think about these concept less in terms of necessary criteria and hard lines, and more in terms of influence and approach and focus.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited</em> by William Cook</a> (itself a paper that revisits <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On understanding data types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</em> by Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner</a>) lays out simple definitions of the often-used concepts of “abstract data type” and “object”. His definition of “object” is, of course, not the only one, but I think it's a useful one. Importantly, Cook's definition is based on abstract criteria that can apply even when the language itself does not have an explicit concept of an “object”. To emphasize this, I'm going to use Haskell in this blog post to demonstrate a pure functional variation on “object-oriented programming”<sup id="fnref:lang"><a href="#fn:lang" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being a useful definition, Cook's formulation is also a valuable design pattern, one which has both advantages and disadvantages when designing programs. Consequently, the goal of this blog post is twofold: first, to show how “objects” can (under some definition) exist in a language like Haskell which has no built-in notion of “object-oriented programming”, and secondly, to show the advantages and disadvantages of code written in this style.</p>



<p>Cook's definition of an <em>abstract data type</em> is a type that</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] has a public name, a hidden representation, and operations to create, combine, and observe values of the abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>To use a simplified version of his example, here's a (not terribly efficient) way of defining a “set of integers” in Haskell as an abstract data type. In this case, we've got an <code>IntSet</code> type whose representation can be easily hidden, because the operations that a consumer of this library cares about about have been defined in terms of that abstract representation.</p>

<pre><code>-- we'll export `IntSet` but not the constructors
data IntSet
  = SetEmpty
  | SetInsert Int IntSet

empty :: IntSet
empty = SetEmpty

isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
isEmpty SetEmpty = True
isEmpty _ = False

insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
insert x set
  | contains set x = set
  | otherwise = SetInsert x set

contains :: IntSet -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
contains SetEmpty x = False
contains (SetInsert y rest) x
  | x == y = True
  | otherwise = contains rest x
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably not a terribly controversial definition or design: it's a pretty typical one for most functional languages! …well, it might be controversial to <em>use</em> since it's got awful algorithmic performance, but it's fairly unobjectionable as a teaching tool, at least.</p>

<p>What would a user see when looking at the documentation for this module? Since we're not exporting the constructors for <code>IntSet</code>, it'll look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data IntSet
empty :: IntSet
isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
contains :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to hide the definition of <code>IntSet</code> is the thing that makes this an abstract data type. A user of the library doesn't care—and ideally doesn't <em>need</em> to care—what constructors hide behind that <code>IntSet</code>.</p>



<p>Cook then goes on to describe “objects”. Here's another (equally inefficient) implementation of <code>IntSet</code>, which I'll define as <code>OIntSet</code> so I can easily refer to both:</p>

<pre><code>data OIntSet = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty :: Bool
  , oContains :: Int -&gt; Bool
  }

oEmpty :: OIntSet
oEmpty = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = True
  , oContains = \_ -&gt; False
  }

oInsert :: Int -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oInsert x set
  | oContains set x = set
  | otherwise = OIntSet
      { oIsEmpty = False
      , oContains = \i -&gt; i == x || oContains set i
      }
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible that we can choose our export list carefully so that this implementation of <code>OIntSet</code> reveals the exact same set of operations as the previous one. However, there's a major difference here: <code>OIntSet</code> is not actually hiding a specific type. Instead, it just bundles the relevant set of operations inside of a record of functions, which acts like an interface type. In both the ADT-based approach and the “object”-based approach, a user does not know about the internal representation of <code>OIntSet</code>, but in the ADT approach, this is because there exists a single representation which is non-public, while in the “object”-based approach, there may be multiple separate implementations that are indistinguishable.</p>



<p>An “object”-like representation allows for a vast amount of flexibility. Because a consumer of an <code>OIntSet</code> can use any value as long as the value has provided implementations of the relevant “methods”, we can easily and conveniently define new instances of <code>OIntSet</code> that have radically different internal representations. For example, we can define infinite sets that use simple numerical computations to define their <code>oContains</code> method, like this set of all even numbers:</p>

<pre><code>oEvenNumbers :: OIntSet
oEvenNumbers = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = False
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `mod` 2 == 0
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could construct <code>OIntSet</code> values that use a different data representation, such as a list, to store the members of the set:</p>

<pre><code>oFromList :: [Int] -&gt; OIntSet
oFromList list = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = null list
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `elem` list
  }
</code></pre>

<p>But even though these <code>OIntSet</code> definitions use different underlying data representations, they expose the same interface, so we can use the same operations to manipulate them. For example, we can define an <code>oUnion</code> operation which computes the union of two <code>OIntSet</code> objects, since that operation is easily expressible in terms of <code>oIsEmpty</code> and <code>oContains</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oUnion :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oUnion set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = oIsEmpty set &amp;&amp; oIsEmpty set'
  , oContains = \i -&gt; oContains set i || oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>oUnion</code> operation—indeed, any operation we define—can work on any two <code>OIntSet</code>s even if they have wildly different internal representations. We can even use this to combine all of our previously-defined <code>OIntSet</code> constructors into one expression, to create a set that uses a combination of Haskell lists, numeric predicates, and closures to represent a set:</p>

<pre><code>sample :: OIntSet
sample = oInsert 1 oEvenNumbers `oUnion` oFromList [10..20]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very convenient way of building certain abstractions. By building around external interfaces, you can include varying data representations that easily work together.</p>

<p>This example is clearly a little bit contrived, so it's probably worth giving some other “real-world” examples where this design approach is useful. Object-oriented programming is generally cited as a good fit for a particular style of user interface programming, because it allows you to define classes of “widgets” that expose a common interface but have different internal representations. You could build a Haskell GUI library in this style by defining <code>Widgets</code> as “objects” with a common interface, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data Widget = Widget
  { drawWidget :: Ctx -&gt; Position -&gt; IO ()
  , handleEvent :: Event -&gt; IO ()
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/" rel="nofollow">Brick TUI library</a>, which has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.54/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:Widget" rel="nofollow">its own <code>Widget</code> record</a>.</p>



<p>One major concern with this style of data representation is performance and optimization. Consider our original ADT representation for <code>IntSet</code>: it's inefficient, yes, but we can make it more efficient in a number of ways. For example, we could modify it so that, instead of always inserting new elements “at the front”, we can instead insert them in such a way that the internal representation of the set is always sorted lowest-to-highest. This means that we may no longer have to traverse the entire list to check for element membership. Even better, we might swap out the list-like representation for a binary tree representation, maybe doing some rebalancing in certain cases.</p>

<p>There is no way <em>in general</em> to apply these optimizations to the <code>OIntSet</code>-style program. You could define an <code>OIntSet</code> that sits in front of a balanced tree and therefore has faster lookup and insertion, but once it's sitting behind the interface, you no longer have access to those internals. You cannot, for example, write an <code>oUnion</code> operation that rebalances the binary trees behind the two sets it's operating on: it doesn't even know if both sets <em>are</em> backed by trees!</p>

<p>In effect, the major selling point of the “object”-style design here is also a major downside: you don't have guarantees about the specific representation of data, which means your programs can easily mix-and-match different representations, but it also means that your program can't make use of representation-specific knowledge in ways that are advantageous.</p>

<p>There's another major concern as well, and that's that the specific choice of “object” representation can make a big difference in terms of what operations you can and cannot support. Look back at <code>OIntSet</code>—I was able to define <code>oUnion</code>, but what about <code>oIntersection</code>? It turns out that it's not actually possible using the specific representation I've chosen<sup id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>oIntersection :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oIntersection set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = {- ??? -}
  , oIntersection = \i -&gt; oContains set i &amp;&amp; oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement <code>oIsEmpty</code>? I might naïvely try to write the inverse of <code>oUnion</code> and define it as <code>oIsEmpty set || oIsEmpty set'</code>, but that's not at all what I want: the intersection of the set of even numbers and the set of odd numbers is an empty set, but neither the even nor the odd numbers are empty, so this would incorrectly compute their …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://nns.ee/blog/2019/03/21/chroot-shenanigans.html">In my previous post</a>, I described running Arch on an OpenWRT router. Today, I’ll be taking it a step further and running Arch and a full LXDE installation natively on an Amazon Kindle, which can be interacted with directly using the touch screen. This is possible thanks to the Kindle’s operating system being Linux!
<!--description--></p>

<p>You can see the end result in action <a href="https://youtu.be/Bx386xpDqCY">here</a>. Apologies for the shaky video - it was shot using my phone and no tripod.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to follow along, make sure you’ve <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/5_x_Jailbreak">rooted your Kindle</a> beforehand. This is essential – without it, it’s impossible to run custom scripts or binaries.</p>

<p>I’m testing this on an 8th generation Kindle (KT3) – it should, however, work for all recent Kindles given you’ve enough storage and are rooted. You also need to set up <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">USBnetwork</a> for SSH access and optionally <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326">KUAL</a> if you want a simple way of launching the chroot.</p>

<p>First things first: We need to set up a filesystem and extract an Arch installation into it, which we can later chroot into. The filesystem will be a file which will be mounted as a loop device. The reason why we’re not extracting the Arch installation directly into a directory on the Kindle is because the Kindle’s storage filesystem is FAT32. FAT32 doesn’t support required features such as symbolic links, which would break the Arch installation. Please note that this also means that your chroot filesystem can be 4 gigabytes large, at maximum. This can be worked around by mounting the real root inside the chroot filesystem, which it’s still a hacky way to go about it. But I digress.</p>

<p>First, figure out how large your filesystem actually can be. SSH into your Kindle and see how much free space you have:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>df</span> <span>-k</span> /mnt/base-us
<span>Filesystem   1K-blocks  Used    Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/loop/0  3188640    361856  2826784    11%   /mnt/base-us
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems like we have around 2800000K (around 2.8G) of space available. Let’s make our filesystem 2.6G – it’s enough to host our root filesystem and some extra applications, such as LXDE. Note that I’ll be running the following commands on my PC and transferring the filesystem over later. You can also do all of this on the Kindle, but it’s simply easier and faster this way.</p>

<p>Let’s create a blank file of the wanted size. I’m using <code>dd</code>, but you can also use <code>fallocate</code> for this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>arch.img <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1024 <span>count</span><span>=</span>2600000
<span>2600000+0 records in
2600000+0 records out
2662400000 bytes (2.7 GB, 2.5 GiB) copied, 6.92058 s, 385 MB/s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create our filesystem on it. Since we’re doing this on the PC, we need make it 32bit and disable the <code>metadata_csum</code> and <code>huge_file</code> options on the filesystem, as the Kindle’s ext4 kernel doesn’t support them.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>mkfs.ext4 <span>-O</span> ^64bit,^metadata_csum,^huge_file arch.img
<span>mke2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 650000 4k blocks and 162560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a4e72620-368a-44b4-81bb-9e66b2903523
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is optional, but I’ll also disable periodic filesystem checks on it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>tune2fs <span>-c</span> 0 <span>-i</span> 0 arch.img                               
<span>tune2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)         
Setting maximal mount count to -1
Setting interval between checks to 0 seconds
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next it’s time to mount the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>mount <span>-o</span> loop arch.img rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kindle I’m using has a Cortex-A9-based processor, so let’s download the ARMv7 version of Arch Linux ARM from <a href="http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz">here</a>. You can download it and extract then, or simply download and extract at the same time:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>curl <span>-L</span> http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz | <span>sudo tar </span>xz <span>-C</span> rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>sudo</code> is required to extract as it sets up a lot of files with root permissions. You can ignore the errors about <code>SCHILY.fflags</code>. Verify that the files extracted successfully with <code>ls -l rootfs/</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s prepare our Kindle for the filesystem. I opted for hosting the filesystem in <code>extensions/karch</code> as I want to use KUAL for easy launching:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, it’s also a good idea to stop the power daemon to prevent the Kindle from going into sleep mode while transferring the filesystem and interrupting our transfer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>stop powerd
<span>powerd stop/waiting
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s transfer our filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>Connection to 192.168.15.244 closed.

</span><span>$</span><span> </span>scp arch.img root@192.168.15.244:/mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might take quite a bit of time, depending on your connection.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, let’s SSH in once again and set up our mountpoint:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cd</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>system
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to set up my own loop device, so I can have it named, but you can ignore this and opt to use <code>/dev/loop/12</code> or similar instead. Just make sure it’s already not in use with <code>mount</code>.</p>

<p>Setting up a loop point and mounting the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mknod</span> <span>-m0660</span> /dev/loop/karch b 7 250
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span>/dev/loop/karch <span>-t</span> ext4 arch.img system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should also mount some system directories into it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev system/dev
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev/pts system/dev/pts
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /proc system/proc
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /sys system/sys
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /tmp system/tmp
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cp</span> /etc/hosts system/etc/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s time to chroot into our new system and set it up for LXDE. You can also use this opportunity to set up whatever applications you need, such as an onscreen keyboard:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/locale.gen 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>locale-gen
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>rm</span> /etc/resolv.conf 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 8.8.8.8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--init</span> <span># this will take a while</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--populate</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-Syu</span> <span>--noconfirm</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-S</span> lxde xorg-server-xephyr <span>--noconfirm</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Xephyr because it’s the easiest way to get our LXDE session up and running. Since the Kindle uses X11 natively, we can try using that. It’s possible to stop the native window manager using <code>stop lab126_gui</code> outside the chroot, but then the Kindle will stop updating the screen with new data, leaving it blank – forcing you to use something like <code>eips</code> to refresh the screen. The X server still works, however, and you can confirm this by using something like <code>x11vnc</code> after running your own WM in it. Xephyr spawns a new X server inside the preexisting X server, which is not as efficient but a lot easier.</p>

<p>We can however stop everything else related to the native GUI, as we need the extra memory and we can’t use it while LXDE is running anyways:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>SERVICES</span><span>=</span><span>"framework pillow webreader kb contentpackd"</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>stop <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, we need to get the screen size for later:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>eips <span>-i</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>'xres:'</span> | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2"x"$4}'</span>
<span>600x800
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s chroot back into the system and see if we can get LXDE to run. Be sure to replace the screen size parameter if needed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>Xephyr :1 <span>-title</span> <span>"L:A_N:application_ID:xephyr"</span> <span>-screen</span> 600x800 <span>-cc</span> 4 <span>-nocursor</span> &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:1
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>lxsession &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>xrandr <span>-o</span> right
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should have LXDE visible on your Kindle’s screen. Ta-da! Feel free to play around with it. I’ve found that the touch screen is suprisingly accurate, even though it is using an IR LED system to detect touches instead of a normal digitizer.</p>

<p>Once done in the chroot, Ctrl-C + Ctrl-D can be issued to exit the chroot. We can then restore the Kindle UI by doing:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>start <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might take a while for anything to display again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned setting up a KUAL extension to automate the entering and exiting of the chroot. You can find that <a href="https://github.com/neonsea/karch">here</a>. If you’re interested in using this, make sure you’ve set up your filesystem first and copied it over to the same directory as the extension, and that it’s named <code>arch.img</code>. Everything else is not mandatory - the extension will do it for you.</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/"><img alt="VisiCalc" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/visicalc.jpg"></a></p>
</div>
<p>
Spreadsheets attract people with a hacker mindset, since they reward a
little technical curiosity with a big jump in capability. Despite
that, while there are some open source spreadsheet projects, most of
the action is closed source (Excel, Airtable, Honeycode, etc). Grist is a solid,
modern, powerful spreadsheet that fits well into the open-source
ecology, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as it is to
hacker-users. Here are some reasons why.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="Linked sections" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/links.webp"></p>
<p>
Grist borrows visually from classic spreadsheets and modern
dashboards, with every view backed by relational data, filtered and
linked with other views as needed. Grist takes care of the data, and keeping
it live, so custom views are easy to add if you need something new,
using <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#minimal-example">standard HTML/JS/CSS</a>. For example, live-updating
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-08-invoices/">invoices</a>,
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-10-print-labels/">mailing labels</a>,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/iqhzhQM66qg7/Pedigree-Example/m/fork/p/2#a1.s3.r11.c2">goat pedigrees</a>,
 <a href="https://public.getgrist.com/doc/exoplanets/m/fork">exoplanet birthday card</a>,
 or <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/qctFijX9HUZu/Morse-Code/m/fork/p/2">morse code quizzer</a> that look just how you want them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="datasette" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/datasette.png"></p>
<p>
Grist is a <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document">self-contained format</a>, based on SQLite. Grist tables
are literally SQLite tables, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
For example, I can take a Grist
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/investment-research">example investment spreadsheet</a>
and publish it using Simon Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>
as a <a href="https://candy-tourmaline-efraasia.glitch.me/data/Investments">Glitch remix</a>
without any conversion steps needed. This is a step up from exporting CSV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="python formulas" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/spots-left.png"></p>
<p>
Grist uses <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">python as its formula language</a>. Python has a good standard
library, nice syntax for working with lists, and is a favorite of data
scientists. Grist itself is written in TypeScript, with formula
evaluation isolated in a sandbox.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="data diff" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/diff.png"></p>

<p>
The Grist format makes it easy to find the most recent common ancestor
of two versions of a document, facilitating three-way comparisons and
git-style revision control. When working on a Grist spreadsheet with someone,
you can use real-time collaborative editing -
or you may sometimes prefer to
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/copying-docs/#trying-out-changes">“fork” your spreadsheet</a>,
make a set of changes,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/syx4YUwXdDyP/NYC-Bridges?compare=syx4YUwXdDyPELJUEqShA9~o4CKdSVuVQfGbyHCXctpqV~4">compare them with the original</a>
and then land them back.  We’re excited to flesh this workflow
out, and I think any programmer can see where we’re going with it.

<p>
Grist code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">github.com/gristlabs/grist-core</a>
under a standard free and open source licence (Apache 2.0).
Grist software is developed by Grist Labs, which offers <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/pricing">free and paid
hosting plans</a>. Whether you choose us to host your spreadsheets,
or to run Grist yourself, you have the comfort of knowing the developers have revenue
(so they won’t one day vanish in the morning sun like an elusive gleam of dew on a flower),
and you have the code and your data (ditto).
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/"><img alt="spreadsheet jsfiddle" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/fiddle.png"></a></p>
<p>
“Fiddle” sites are very handy for communicating and learning about a
technology. I know I learned a lot about javascript by playing
with this 30-line implemention of a spreadsheet:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/">https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/</a>. Grist supports fiddles almost by
accident, because you can <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/">use Grist without logging in</a>,
and you can quickly edit a “fork” of a spreadsheet without changing your original.
Here, try <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program/m/fork">fiddling with one of our examples</a>. You won’t break it.
</p>
</div>

<p>Grist supports <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns">attachments</a>, and those attachments can be downloaded as part of a
single Grist file format.
Grist has solid undo/redo support.
Hosted Grist makes <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/automatic-backups/">automatic backups</a> at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals.
Grist has <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/rest-api/">an API</a> and a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations">Zapier integration</a>.
Grist supports real time collaboration.
Grist supports many <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">Excel functions</a>.
We publish a Grist docker image (see the <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist">README</a>),
and have an unreleased standalone app for Windows/Mac/Linux that we’ll be bringing
up to date.
</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322"><img alt="Plimpton 322 tablet" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/Plimpton322.jpg"></a></p>
</div>

<p>
Spreadsheets have evolved a lot since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Babylonian times</a>.
In open-source, <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> are venerable standalone
Excel replacements.
<a href="https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet">LuckySheet</a> is a shot at a clone of that standalone experience in the browser.
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/">Ethercalc</a> is a real-time collaborative spreadsheet, developed by
Audrey Tang, now Taiwan’s Digital Minister, extending work they did with Dan Bricklin on SocialCalc.
Evolving further, hybrid spreadsheet-database models are growing in usefulness and
popularity. That's what Grist is, and we are pleased to bring it now
to the open-source community.
</p>
</div>

<p>Spreadsheets have a long tail of features that are “must haves” for someone out there.
We think a quality, open code base is a big help for realizing those features, and having
peace of mind in relying on them.
Just as Babylonian clay tablets were, we hope that Grist will prove a
sturdy data storage and presentation infrastructure that
can survive for years (if not centuries!) to come.
</p>

<p>Come play with <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/">hosted Grist</a>, or
explore and build <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">Grist
source code</a>. In either case, we'd be grateful for your feedback at

that provides a unique view of your files by removing the
hierarchy constraints typically imposed on files and folders. In other words, it allows you to think about your
files not as objects <em>stored</em> in folders, but as objects that can be <em>filtered</em> by folders.</p>
<p>Below, the file path <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/glossary.html#term-intersection"><span>intersection</span></a> of all of the files that have been tagged with the
tags <code><span>A</span></code>, <code><span>B</span></code>, and <code><span>C</span></code>. Notice that the resulting files do not live <em>inside</em> of the full path,
they simply appear there because they’ve been tagged with each part of the file path.
Supertag takes care of rendering a dynamic directory
structure through which you can filter and navigate these files.</p>
<p><img alt="Supertag file intersection" src="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/_images/intersection-opt.gif"></p><div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the same file intersection as <code><span>/C/B/A</span></code>, <code><span>/B/C/A</span></code>, etc. It doesn’t matter what
order that the path tags are in, because we’re simply dealing with the intersection of the tags.</p>

<p>Cool, right? See <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/usage/quickstart.html#quickstart"><span>Quickstart</span></a> for the crash course.</p>

But before that, let me explain a few Ruby features that you may not know.</p>  <h2 id="editing-a-file-in-place"> Editing a file in place <a href="#editing-a-file-in-place"></a> </h2> <p>Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>gets</span>

<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we run:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span> script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As you can see, with the <code>-i</code> flag we can read the text file line-by-line through <code>gets</code>, and replace that line with whatever is in the standard output (the <code>puts</code>).</p> <h2 id="backup-files"> Backup files <a href="#backup-files"></a> </h2> <p>Let’s run the script above again, but instead of the <code>-i</code> we pass to Ruby, let’s pass <code>-i.bak</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>All this does is create a backup file (with the extension <code>.bak</code> in our case) with the original contents before modifying it.</p> <h2 id="run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"> Run the Ruby script line-by-line <a href="#run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"></a> </h2> <p>Did you know we can do the above, but with a single line of Ruby code? Consider the following Ruby script:</p>  <p>And then we run it as the following (notice we are running the script with an extra <code>-p</code> flag):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>-p</code> flag conviniently wraps your code around an implicit <code>while gets(); ...; puts $_; end</code>.</p> <h2 id="begin-blocks"> <code>BEGIN</code> blocks <a href="#begin-blocks"></a> </h2> <p>One question you might ask yourself is, if I use the <code>-p</code> flag, how do I do global setup? Ruby’s got a feature for that! Enter <code>BEGIN</code> blocks.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: Ruby’s keywords are case sensitive, so <code>BEGIN</code> is not the same as <code>begin</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So now, if we do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Notice we get the <code>It is starting!</code> output in the terminal, and not in the file.</p> <h2 id="shebang"> Shebang <a href="#shebang"></a> </h2> <p>We want to minimize the number of characters we have to type. So we can omit the flags from the terminal and instead include it in the file using a shebang line.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In fact, Ruby doesn’t actually check that the binary in the shebang is valid, just that it ends in <code>ruby</code>. So the following shebang would have worked too:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/some/invalid/dir/ruby -pi.bak</span>
</code></pre></div></div>  <p>Ok, we finally have everything we need to reproduce the bug. Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>full_mark: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
  <span>1000000</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span>
    <span>arr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"fooo</span><span>#{</span><span>x</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>So what do we expect it to do? Well, this is pretty much the same script as the one in example #5 (while doing some seemingly useless work in the <code>BEGIN</code> block).</p> <p>So let’s run this script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
<span>cat</span>: temp.txt.bak: No such file or directory

<span>$ </span><span>ls
</span>script.rb
temp.txt
temp.txto106
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Wait what!?!? Where is our backup file <code>temp.txt.bak</code>? And what is <code>temp.txto106</code>? Let’s inspect these files.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txto106
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It seems like <code>temp.txto106</code> contains the original file (the one that should have been the backup file). So what’s going on? You might have guessed it, because the wrong C function was used to create Ruby strings!</p> <h2 id="so-whats-wrong"> So, what’s wrong? <a href="#so-whats-wrong"></a> </h2> <p>When you pass the flag <code>-i.bak</code> to Ruby, it parses the arguments in your shebang from a Ruby string read from the contents of the Ruby script<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. We then set the extension of the backup file by calling <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66efe373116d510c05d57964b5ffa47f1c6e565c/io.c#L12989"><code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code></a>. This function is really simple, it’s defined like this.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span>
<span>ruby_set_inplace_mode</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>suffix</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ARGF</span><span>.</span><span>inplace</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qfalse</span> <span>:</span> <span>!*</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qnil</span> <span>:</span> <span>rb_fstring_cstr</span><span>(</span><span>suffix</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The problem here is the usage of <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code>, which (similar to <code>rb_str_new_static</code>) expects a pointer to a region of memory that is not <code>free</code>‘d before this Ruby string is swept (because it sets the pointer of the Ruby string directly to the string passed in).</p> <p>To explain using diagrams (don’t we all love diagrams?), we have a Ruby string of the flags in the shebang stored in <code>argv</code>. We then call <code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code> and set <code>ARGF.inplace</code> to a Ruby string that points to <code>.bak</code>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug1.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>But then when we no longer need <code>argv</code>, but <code>ARGF.inplace</code> is still pointing to the string that <code>argv</code> was referencing.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug2.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>So then we call <code>GC.start</code> which guarantees that <code>argv</code> is swept, and then we create a large amount of <code>fooo#{x}</code> strings. This helps us make sure the string <code>-pi.bak</code> is overwritten and so we get <code>ARGF.inplace</code> pointing to some other value. So then once the script terminates, the backup extension we use is <code>o106</code> (or some other gibberish).</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug3.png" height="300"> </figure> <h2 id="the-fix"> The fix <a href="#the-fix"></a> </h2> <p>The fix only changes one line and a few characters!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The solution is instead of calling <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code> to create the string, we use <code>rb_str_new</code>, which allocates memory for the string and copies over the contents of the string. Once we do that, we no longer need to ensure that the original string is not <code>free</code>‘d.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgements"> Acknowledgements <a href="#acknowledgements"></a> </h2> <p>I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www.eightbitraptor.com/">Matt Valentine-House</a> as the co-discoverer of the bug and the co-author of the fix.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/tags#x86">x86</a>
    
  
  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conventional">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ignore">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:normal-ish">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mynames">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sdm">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>MM0</code> through <code>MM7</code>, MMX also defines a new status register (<code>MXCSR</code>) as well as
a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 9</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 101</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sse-and-avx">SSE and AVX</h3>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to wrap SSE and AVX into a single section: they use the same
sub-register pattern as the GPRs and x87/MMX do, so they fit well into a single table:</p>

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDSTATUS</code>: Bound status, after a <code>#BR</code> is raised.</li>

<h2 id="debug-registers">Debug registers</h2>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:guess">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

<article>
<p>I have no real interests or hobbies. If I was shopping for myself I’d probably just buy another book on “growing your side hustle” or one of the many “building a startup” books.</p>
<p>Revenue, monetization, and profit are always the primary driver for my activities. Whether or not I actually care about a particular topic is sorta irrelevant. And my frustration is that depending on who I talk to, I get entirely different perspectives on whether this going to facilitate my success in life or not. For example, people who are like my business/money focused family applaud my efforts. They don’t understand how this is bad.</p>
<p>“Dave, how is spending your free time trying to make more money a bad thing? You can use that money to pursue your hobbies or interests.”</p>
<p>“Yeah uncle, but I honestly don’t know what my hobbies and interests are besides things that make more money.”</p>
<p>“Great Dave, so your passion is making money!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t want that to be my passion!”</p>
<p>But if I talk to my more passion focused friends, I’m sorta self-judging in my head.</p>
<p>“Dave, I’m working on a youth charity. It’s soo many hours of long work and stressful, but really rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Oh umm…that’s great Pam. But that’s a lot of work, and no money? Like…is it really worth it? Imagine if you turned it into some type of education business. What’s the market like for that? You could charge at least $300 per student.”</p>
<p>Ugh, this is what gives me migraines. My 25 year old anxiety is telling me that if I pick the wrong strategy then my future is forever doomed. I also have no idea where this obsession began. I didn’t grow up poor, so I can’t use that as an excuse for my obsession. I think it might have to do with imposter syndrome and feeling like I have to prove myself. Basically, if I have lots of money rolling in then I can say “fuck the system” and not be criticized. I falsely feel like people can’t judge me if I have my own business that’s making Elon Musk level income.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s simply because I live in the United States, and that’s just our culture here. Plus with all the uncertainty, you never know when debt can hit you. Poverty, streets, homeless shelter, etc.</p>
<p>But this just all feels wrong to me. It feels like I’m digging myself into a bad hole. What if my time was used toward genuine activities and interests? I could also have a chance at financial success with those. I just don’t know what those genuine interests are. All I know is that when I chase after these money quests, I always feel cheated in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s walk inside my mind for a second.</p>
<p>So I work on coding side projects outside of work. Do I love coding and problem solving? Eh, I’m not really sure. But, I do love the idea of one day rolling in cash from some tool or app I built. Therefore, I’m going to spend my time trying to find a niche market that I can penetrate with some basic app/program that I can at least charge $100 a month for. Then I just need to spend a couple of hours everyday scouring through Google trends, Reddit, or Exploding Topics to find something people are currently into. Then maybe set up a landing page, and see if people enter in their credit card info. Or how about I search the Apple App Store and find some shitty app that people pay big bucks for and copy it? Oh wait, hold up, snack boxes are trending! Okay, so I can just set up a service for $20 a month to send people almonds, right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it gets worst.</p>
<p>I make videos on YouTube. I have a little over 200k subscribers currently. Do I like making videos? Eh…I’m not really sure. Truthfully, most days I would rather not engage in the activity. But influencer sponsorships pay a lot! Also, adsense is a really nice passive income source. So what I need to do is spend my time studying the YouTube algorithm so I can produce videos that get more views. More views equals more money!! Oh and remember when I made videos on Android? Yeah nobody cares about that niche anymore. So I’m going to use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to see trending topics that people are watching. Okay people are all talking about <em>Among Us</em> right now. So if I make a video that’s at least 10 minutes long I can stick a mid-roll ad into it too! Don’t forget all the long-tail keywords. Wait, my website hardly has any ads on it right now. I’m missing out on extra income! I need at least a sidebar ad and also a footer ad.</p>
<p>Guess what? After two days I lost motivation in the Snackbox idea. As for YouTube, I made videos on the “well researched SEO friendly topics” and they performed horribly. It was like another slap in the face saying “Dave, this is what happens when you chase money without regard for interests.” But….but…all the entrepreneurs say just having interest in building a business is enough!</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don’t know what to say or how to end this. I’m just hoping that by sharing my obstacles and fears I get some helpful incite; or at least connect people who also share this struggle. I feel like it’s one of the many problems that’s not addressed adequately and leaves us just desperate for answers.</p>

<p>I write and prefer code that fits within 80 columns in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and other projects – and there are reasons for it. I’m a little bored by the people who respond and say that they have 400 inch monitors already and they can use them.</p>



<p>I too have multiple large high resolution screens – but writing wide code is still a bad idea! So I decided I’ll write down my reasoning once and for all!</p>



<h2>Narrower is easier to read</h2>



<p>There’s a reason newspapers and magazines have used narrow texts for centuries and in fact even books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length">aren’t using long lines</a>. For most humans, it is simply easier on the eyes and brain to read texts that aren’t using really long lines. This has been known for a very long time.</p>



<p>Easy-to-read code is easier to follow and understand which leads to fewer bugs and faster debugging.</p>



<h2>Side-by-side works better</h2>



<p>I <em>never</em> run windows full sized on my screens for anything except watching movies. I frequently have two or more editor windows next to each other, sometimes also with one or two extra terminal/debugger windows next to those. To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.</p>



<p>Sometimes reading a code diff is easier side-by-side and then too it is important that the two can fit next to each other nicely.</p>



<h2>Better diffs</h2>



<p>Having code grow vertically rather than horizontally is beneficial for diff, git and other tools that work on changes to files. It reduces the risk of merge conflicts and it makes the merge conflicts that still happen easier to deal with.</p>



<h2>It encourages shorter names</h2>



<p>A side effect by strictly not allowing anything beyond column 80 is that it becomes really hard to use those terribly annoying 30+ letters java-style names on functions and identifiers. A function name, and especially local ones, should be short. Having long names make them really hard to read and makes it really hard to spot the difference between the other functions with similarly long names where just a sub-word within is changed.</p>



<p>I know especially Java people object to this as they’re trained in a different culture and say that a method name should rather include a lot of details of the functionality “to help the user”, but to me that’s a weak argument as all non-trivial functions will have more functionality than what can be expressed in the name and thus the user needs to know how the function works <em>anyway.</em></p>



<p>I don’t mean 2-letter names. I mean long enough to make sense but not be ridiculous lengths. Usually within 15 letters or so.</p>



<h2>Just a few spaces per indent level</h2>



<p>To make this work, and yet allow a few indent levels, the code basically have to have small indent-levels, so I prefer to have it set to two spaces per level.</p>



<h2>Many indent levels is wrong anyway</h2>



<p>If you do a lot of indent levels it gets really hard to write code that still fits within the 80 column limit. That’s a subtle way to suggest that you should not write functions that needs or uses that many indent levels. It should then rather be split out into multiple smaller functions, where then each function won’t need that many levels!</p>



<h2>Why exactly 80?</h2>



<p>Once upon the time it was of course because terminals had that limit and these days the exact number 80 is not a must. I just happen to think that the limit has worked fine in the past and I haven’t found any compelling reason to change it since.</p>



<p>It also has to be a hard and fixed limit as if we allow a few places to go beyond the limit we end up on a slippery slope and code slowly grow wider over time – I’ve seen it happen in many projects with “soft enforcement” on code column limits.</p>



<h2>Enforced by a tool</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, we have ‘checksrc’ which will yell errors at any user trying to build code with a too long line present. This is good because then we don’t have to “waste” human efforts to point this out to contributors who offer pull requests. The tool will point out such mistakes with ruthless accuracy.</p>



<h2>Credits</h2>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 11/28/2020</p>

      <p>I’m not fat. There I said it, I should feel better about myself, right? Size is just a number. Right? Come on you know it’s true, size, weight and all that jazz is just a BS figure on the scale. That’s what we tell ourselves to make us feel better.</p>

<p>I’m obese, my medical BMI is 42.0. I’m 335 pounds. As Penn Jillette would say, I’m a “fat fuck”. I’m tired of being a “fat fuck” or as my wife prefers a “big guy”.</p>



<p>I’m an audiobook guy. I’m in love with Audible, she is very wonderful service to have, she reads to me every day, all day. About two weeks ago, I was bored, and she suggested Presto, a book by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. I was bored, lazy and waiting for someone so I bought the book. Oh my gosh, the language is obscene, but the author is hilarious and entertaining. I could not put the book down. It made me want to toss the skinny white peppermint mocha and bananas in the trash…</p>

<p>Basically, Penn is a obese guy like me, well he was, he was 330 pounds at his highest. He went to the hospital for heart issues and nearly died. On a fist full of pills to keep his blood pressure less than the voltage of an outlet in Europe he embarked on a crazy, all in diet consisting of potatoes for two weeks. I like his style, he’s an all or nothing guy like me. Either give me the steak, the ice cream and the sides or give me nothing. I want to eat big; I want to live big. Moderation is bullshit as Penn would say, I would agree! I don’t do anything in moderation. If I’m going to do something, it’s all-in baby. When in Vegas last summer, I was the dipshit who went all in with a pair of kings in my hand and straight on the table; that’s me baby, not the smartest guy but hey I like to live it big.</p>

<p>I don’t do keto, I don’t do paleo, but when I do diet, I go really big, I go to Costco and literally buy everything I need to be successful on that plan, I research, I plan. It’s just like thanksgiving this year; I researched, I planned, I went to Costco and planned out each and every ingredient. I was diligent. Every doctor, health coach and fitness instructor has told me that my relationship with food is fucked up. Well, not fucked up, but bad; unhealthy. As Penn would say your life sucks if you’re taking diet advice from a Las Vegas Magician, well, Penn, my life does suck. I can’t breathe outside very well, hell, I get windy walking to the park. I’m an obese guy, I have a CPAP machine, I’m 335 pounds, I can barely do the things I want to do, basic stuff; sleep and wake rested, eat and not feel sick, go for a walk and not get winded. I’m half Penn’s age and his same weight… It’s time for a change.</p>



<p>The plan according to Penn’s buddy, Cray Ray, aka “Ray Cronise” is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eat nothing but potatoes for two weeks. Boiled, baked, steamed, roasted; does not matter, just no salt, oil, or sugar. Plain, nothing added, no salt, no butter, no pepper, no olive oil, just a plain, boring potato. Sweet, red, yellow, gold, purple, do not be a racist pig about potatoes, eat the potato rainbow, but just potatoes. Feel free to pig out on potatoes; just no fries or chips, that’s the beautiful potato ruined by Americans</li>
  <li>Contrast showers: Humans have conquered winter &amp; cold. Therefore, in order to get back to the biologically true lifestyle we’ve grown as a species as, we need to bring back the cold. Turn down the thermostat and cycle 10 seconds hot; 30 seconds cold showers for 5 minutes. It’s brutal but the time goes by shockingly fast</li>
  <li>After two weeks on potatoes, you go to a plant based, vegan lifestyle until you hit your target weight</li>
</ol>



<p>One big thing with CrayRay and Penn is the need for a scale, the smartass of scales. On an impluse I plopped down $100 for the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body + scale</a>. It’s been 10 days! 10 DAYS!!! I’m 326.4, on day 2 of the plan. In 10 days, 1 of which involving nothing but potatoes, I’ve lost 9 pounds. This is AMAZING.</p>

<p>On day 1, it’s black Friday, or sucker day of the year. Everyone piles in their car after a Thanksgiving Day hang over consisting of pie and turkey, to go buy more stuff to stuff into their garage in six months. It’s all American in style and glory. What am I do? Well, shopping for TVs on Amazon like every other fat guy scared out of his mind of COVID-19. I’m sitting on my couch waiting for the oven, 350 degrees for 45 minutes, to produce 9 potatoes. That’s right 9 potatoes, or about 1000 ish calories. Once done cooking, I scarf down one single sweet potato. It’s sweet (no shit sherlock), delicious and surprisingly moist. I like it, I chase it with 4 tiny petite potatoes and some black coffee. This diet is sure boring.</p>

<p>Lunch time rolls around and I make some food for the kiddo and thanksgiving dinner for lunch for the wife. What do I have? If you guessed potatoes, you’d win the prize! I had 2 potatoes, a red and white. It was bland, boring and good.</p>

<p>A car ride nap, so more black coffee and about 2 liters of water later, we’re sitting down to dinner. I made peanut noodles for the wife, mac and cheese with some TG leftovers for the baby. I have 3 more potatoes, a gold, a red and a sweet potato. 2 potatoes into the meal, I’m stuffed. STUFFED ON TWO POTATOES?!?!??! Yeah, I save the sweet potato for dessert and decide to count my potatoes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while prepping for thanksgiving, I bought 10 pounds of potatoes. I thought that was a LOT of potatoes, but when I counted it out I had around 20 potatoes left. That’s enough to feed a family a four a potato a night for a week, but for a guy living on potatoes? It’s more like two days if I’m lucky, so I head to Costco.</p>

<p>I love Costco. Everything there is a deal, no matter what the idiots on Life Hacker tell you. I love their steak, their fruit and yes, I love their clothes and bedding. But potatoes, that’s where you really make off like bandits. The potatoes were on sale today too.</p>

<p>I knew to continue the diet I needed to account for 14 days of potatoes, less today and the 1.5 I had in revere; thus, I knew I need about 12 (rounding up) days of potatoes. I’m supposed to be on a calorie restricted diet of 1800 or less per day, which is helping, but to get 1800 calories a day eating just potatoes, I’d need to consume 5 POUNDS of potatoes. That’s right, every day on this thing to hit target calorie intake I’d need 5 POUNDS!?!?!? So, with 12 days needed to be shopped, a total of 60 pounds of potatoes, I headed to Costco.</p>

<p>68 pounds of potatoes for a whopping $49!</p>

<p>Here’s what my shopping chart looked like:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.adambourg.com/assets/img/potato-diet-posts/costco-potatoes.png" alt="Costco cart"></p>

<p>That’s a lot of potatoes! The berries are for my son, Luke, for him to eat with yogurt and breakfast for the next two weeks. Not pictured is the bottles of the sparkling water I got to enhance my diet this week.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to see me shirtless, it’s time to close the page. My starting stats on 11/20/2020 are: 335 LBS, but the offical, diet starting stats are: 333.4 lbs, BMI of 41.7. I’ll be updating this blog with progress, but here’s to my weightloss and success.</p>

<p>I’m off to eat more potatoes!</p>

<p>They told me, “You have to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhThso-PE_o">this interview where Mike Tyson talks about medieval history</a>,” and so I did, and there he was at the New York Public Library in 2013 being interviewed by curator Paul Holdengräber, whose German accent strikes the American ear as both effortlessly intellectual and lightly amusing, and who would seem to have nothing in common with the face-tattooed boxer.</p>



<p><img data-attachment-id="12067" data-permalink="https://quidplura.com/2020/11/29/and-this-worlds-a-fickle-measure/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11-57-11-pm-copy/" data-orig-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" data-orig-size="1816,934" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-11-28 at 11.57.11 PM copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=863" src="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>The two men do, in fact, find much to talk about. Their discussion is mesmerizing, because to most of us Mike Tyson is nothing but a face and fists, not a man who reflects aloud and at length about his inner life. Holdengräber prompts a reticent Tyson to narrate clips of his greatest moments in the ring, and newcomers to boxing will easily see why Tyson was such a sensation, but Iron Mike grows more animated when other matters arise.</p>



<p>Half an hour into the interview, Holdengräber says that their mutual friend, eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog, urged him to ask Tyson why he’s so fascinated by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingian Frankish dynasty, and Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks. Tyson’s answer, however halting, makes him come alive: </p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know—it all comes from my insecurity from being poor, and not having enough—to be insecure, and being—yeah, that’s what it is: obscure. I never wanted to be obscure. I was born in obscurity and I never wanted to deal with that again, never wanted to be that. And they came from obscurity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tyson then narrates a capsule history of the Frankish kings. He rambles, he doesn’t get all the details right, and his mispronunciation of names marks him as an autodidact, but it’s a shame to hear the audience laugh when Holdengräber asks, “Mike, how do you know all this shit?” Whether Tyson is mapping his own experiences onto medieval history or hearing echoes of the Franks in his troubled life, the credentialed, status-conscious audience is uncomfortable with his sincere interest in a past they find trivial.</p>



<p>Yet Tyson is the real deal, a book lover not because his peer group yaks about whichever author the <em>New York Times</em> has dubbed fame’s latest love child, but because he’s hungry for ideas, for meaning, for connections across time. He speaks with undisguised emotion about Cus D’Amato, the trainer and manager who turned him into a lethal boxer. Obsessed with Nietzsche and Clausewitz, D’Amato taught Tyson to see boxing as war and war as the key to decoding the world. “That is just what I do,” Tyson explains, an attentive pupil and dutiful son. “I love war. I love the act of war. I love the players in war, the philosophy of war.”</p>



<p>Tyson is searching for more than war on the pages of the past. Having grown up amid crime and chaos and founded his life on violence, he now relies on books to make moral and ethical sense of the world:</p>



<blockquote><p>Yeah—they’re our most priceless possessions, because if you think about it, you know, a room without a book is like a body without a soul. It’s the only way that we can connect the future with the past. Without that, there’s no way that we can know about the future, and know about particularly the past, or the present, you know, that when you think about history, the value of history is not necessarily scientific but moral. By liberating our minds and deepening our sympathies and fortifying our will, we can control—pretty much history allows us to control not society but ourselves, which is a much more important thing to do, you know what I mean? And it would allow us to pretty much meet the future more so than foretell it, and for that reason alone, in order to predict the future we always have to look through the past, because very rarely does time not repeat itself, and it always will repeat itself. </p><p>I’ve heard a quote before in a book that we would be fools to think historically that the past is us in funny clothes, but the past <em><span>is</span></em> us in funny clothes, and that’s truly what it is. That’s from somebody who really said a really profound statement but he misquoted what he was saying, he must have been saying it backwards, because that’s really what the past was, it’s just us in funny clothes, in different times, that’s really what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, to hear Tyson cite <a href="http://thecampvs.com/2011/08/03/cicero-on-books-and-the-soul/">a quip inaccurately attributed to Cicero</a>, “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” is to wonder if he’s putting us on. Late in the interview, he jokes that if you quote books, you fool people into thinking you’re smart—but Tyson, for all his malapropisms and mispronunciations and odd mannerisms, <em>is</em> intelligent. He’s going round after round with big questions that  many of the ostensibly educated attendees at his book-talk don’t bother to ask.</p>



<p>When Holdengräber suggests that Tyson’s knowledge of history didn’t improve his behavior, Tyson calmly disagrees. He compares himself to the fictional Ben-Hur, a fellow athlete and celebrity who achieved glory but was doomed to be unfree until he set his priorities in order: “He may not have been famous again,” Tyson points out, “but he got his family, and that was his success.” </p>



<p>After listening to Mike Tyson—childhood criminal, devastating fighter, struggling alcoholic and recovering drug addict, convicted rapist, pop-culture eidolon—speak for an hour and a half, I still don’t quite know who he is. He may be the closest thing 21st-century America has to <a href="https://quidplura.com/2011/11/03/but-the-answers-you-seek-will-never-be-found-at-home/">a Robert E. Howard character</a>, a born barbarian who’s ignorant of social niceties but possesses earned wisdom that the civilization around him disdains. I don’t know whether he’s all in on his bookish pursuits or one slight away from again gnawing off someone’s ear. Whether he’s a good man or a bad man feels foolish to ask about a professional punch-thrower who reads Nietzsche, but Tyson looks like a <em>better</em> man, one who has perhaps searched harder for his humanity than the onlookers snickering from the safety of their library seats. What has their pride gained them? Tyson’s, by contrast, has brought him perspective, and with it the humility to admit that his story is still being written—and has been before.</p>

<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=">Employment Security Act</a> requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.</p>

<h2 id="japans-first-employment-agency">Japan’s first employment agency</h2>

<p>The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. <a href="http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html">Keian Yamato</a> was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.</p>

<p>Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.</p>

<h2 id="the-labour-market-in-the-edo-period">The labour market in the Edo Period</h2>

<p>The Edo period started in 1603 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a> officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.</p>

<p>Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai">Sankin-kōtai</a>, which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.</p>

<p>Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.</p>

<p>As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="employment-in-the-edo-period">Employment in the Edo period</h2>

<p>Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC">Hōkō</a>, roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.</p>

<p>The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.</p>

<p>Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.</p>

<p>Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.</p>

<p>While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).</p>

<h2 id="recruiter-or-human-trafficker">Recruiter or human trafficker?</h2>

<p>In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.</p>

<p>For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.</p>

<p>During this period, the government also established special regions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku">Yukaku</a>, which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-towards-regulation-of-recruitment">First steps towards regulation of recruitment</h2>

<p>In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)">the Meiji period</a>. Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.</p>

<p>As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.</p>

<p>With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.</p>

<h2 id="international-attempts-to-ban-private-employment-agencies">International attempts to ban private employment agencies</h2>

<p>As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm">the International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.</p>

<p>At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.</p>

<p>The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.</p>

<p>In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in …</p></article></div>

                    <p>Pay up -- or we’re pulling the plug. </p><p>That’s the approach the news industry should take when it comes to Google and Facebook: Pay for our journalism or we’re banning it from your platforms. </p><p>For too long, journalists have given away their stories for free in exchange for distribution by the duopoly. At best, a story may go viral (rare) or hit the SEO lottery and experience a one-off traffic surge (unsustainable). </p><p>And for that, newsrooms have willingly handed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/google-news-industry-antitrust.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">billions of dollars</a> in ad revenue to the tech giants that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/">threaten</a> their very existence. (Google and Facebook are No. 1 and No. 2 <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-ad-revenue-2019-2020">ad platforms</a> in the U.S., respectively).</p><p>The news industry as a whole needs to come together and demand to be fairly compensated for their contributions. Until Facebook and Google agree to pay up, they are simply exploiting journalism under the pretext of democratizing information. </p><p>News drives habit. Habit drives frequency. And frequency drives time spent. In the attention economy (read: ad-driven), news content entices people to come back and stay in platforms’ carefully crafted ecosystems. </p><p>In short, platforms need news. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said it himself when Facebook launched its news tab in 2019 (its most recent olive branch to publishers). In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/sunday/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-news.html">piece for the<em> New York Times</em></a>, the Facebook founder pledged to “support the news industry” and said that journalism today is “more important than ever.” But only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/23/facebook-offer-news-tab-users-pay-some-publishers-their-work/">some of the 200+ publishers</a> involved in the news tab were actually paid for their contributions. &nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are simply using their high-minded mission statements (e.g. Facebook: To “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and Google: To “organize the world’s information”) as a thuggish pretext for exploiting journalism. </p><p>Instead, they should pay a licencing fee or provide a sizable cut of ad revenue to newsrooms that are populating the platforms (Murdoch analogized this to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/22/rupert-murdoch-facebook-should-pay-news-publishers">carriage fee</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not enough for them to attempt damage control by <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">spinning up funds</a> claiming to help journalism or offering some – but not all – publishers fees for their contributions. (If you want to know how Google really feels about paying for news, see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/google-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSL1N0TV0S520141211">how they treated publishers</a> in Spain).</p><p>That’s why we’re building <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/?utm_source=nillium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=frontpage">Forth</a>, a news-first platform that pays journalists for their work and offers the audience concise updates with context -- from the reporters they trust.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the middle of an actual, like, actual workplace coup with secret meetings, purges, puppetmasters, frame-ups, leak investigations, and (rumored) slack DM surveillance, I was listening to the bombshell podcast and heard about this book about coup-proofing, and how it ruins teams.
I picked up a copy, and this year I read it.</p>

<p>The book (Caitlin Talmadge / <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501700293/the-dictators-army">The Dictator’s Army</a>) is about how coup fears hamstrung management in two wars:
Saddam Hussein’s 8-year failed invasion of Iran, and South Vietnam’s final defense against the North.
This article is about private sector leadership lessons I took from the book.</p>

<p>Writing about private sector leadership on the eve of a plausible military coup seems like peeing into the ocean, but it’s this or doomscrolling and holding in your pee can kill you.</p>

<p>Most management books are aspirational and map out success.
This one is about repeated failure, despite great funding, first-mover advantage and better equipment, through repeated mistakes, and in the public eye.
Nothing that I would know anything about cough.</p>

<p>Startups sub 30 people have a hard time accessing experienced hires who combine domain skill and the ability to work on a team.
There are real reasons for this, and some boil down to something like Saddam’s coup fears.
But if our society plans to continue airlifting cash into small companies, onboarding good middle managers earlier can make more of these bets pay off.</p>

<p>If you prefer a soundtrack, play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbICk05yPk">masterclass on management</a> (from GI Joe’s Cobra Commander) in the background.
It sometimes gets me through the week.</p>

<h2 id="despots-meddle">Despots meddle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
– JS Mill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By inference, if you’re not hiring barbarians and / or they don’t need improvement, or your team is capable of discussion, consider a lighter-weight leadership style.</p>

<p>‘Despot’ also means bronze age feudal landowners or the heir apparent of Byzantium, but we haven’t had those for a while.
Adaptive reuse of the term in revolutionary France gave the term its modern meaning:
an absolute ruler who governs without restraint by the law.
See also ‘frondeur’.</p>

<p>When growing teams take on more complex goals but don’t update their management, they encounter pathologies of delegation –
senior leadership who isn’t sure how to solve problems using middle managers, who give them the wrong length leash.
This is the 10 person to 30 person growth spurt.
Good companies outgrow it this <em>if</em> they survive.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looked like in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decision-making at the senior levels of the Iraqi military revolved more around the fear of what Saddam might do than what the Iranians might do.<sup id="fnref:senior-fear" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:senior-fear">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker,<sup id="fnref:educate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:educate">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technocratic middle managers were spending most of their energy undoing their leader’s bad decisions, rather than fighting and winning.
There’s a spectrum between ‘own worst enemy’ and ‘annoying bandwidth bottleneck’, but new managers generally are on it somewhere.</p>

<p>Over-centralization of authority sends a message that people shouldn’t act on their own, which paralyzes your org.
Note that I’m not arguing against hierarchical authority or a clear chain of command, but rather against authority all concentrating at the top, making it impossible for middle managers to do their jobs.
In Vietnam:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>few officers who had come up in the Diem system were willing to do anything “in the absence of detailed orders.”<sup id="fnref:detailed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:detailed">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization also hamstrings the flexibility of a large team to adapt to new information.
Top leaders, often lacking domain skill or up-to-date information, are best at ‘do nothing without asking me’ orders that trap middle managers in bad positions.
In one case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Saddam had decreed that units were not allowed to cede any ground, the Iraqi defense was poorly coordinated and ineffective, eventually inducing panic.<sup id="fnref:panic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:panic">4</a></sup> …
Iraqi officers in the field lacked the authority to redeploy forward troops or to call on reserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because the dictators aren’t an expert in any part of the organization, lack the attention to focus on everything at once, and aren’t accountable to anyone, they have zero memory.
In one case in Vietnam, President Thieu’s personal intervention not only disrupted the existing strategy, but he had forgotten by the next day that he’d given the order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudden change in orders from an uninformed Thieu was a disaster, resulting in neither a robust defense of the city nor a clean withdrawal.<sup id="fnref:sudden-change" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sudden-change">6</a></sup> … Amazingly … Hue’s abandonment apparently came as a surprise to President Thieu<sup id="fnref:abandonment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abandonment">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unaccountable, illogical plans from inexpert leaders create hills to die on, in some cases literally.
They also come through unusual channels (because hands-on leaders prioritize fast action).
Unusual channels = coordination and preparation impossible for middle managers.
In one case in South Vietnam, a general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personally interceded at all levels, sometimes going so far as to personally issue orders by radio to individual brigade commanders without notifying the division operations center. Both Giai and his division advisers often learned of new orders only as they were being carried out.<sup id="fnref:all-levels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-levels">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By comparison, the North Vietnamese had good delegation and sane command structures in place.
From an internal document, they valued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“unanimity of thought from the top to the bottom regarding the opportunity we faced and the tactics to be employed” but significant room for commanders to execute their plans<sup id="fnref:unanimity" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unanimity">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the American revolution, George III was having a conversation with his American portraitist Benjamin West; he heard Washington was going to resign his commission and ‘return to his farm’.
The King was like ‘ha pull the other one’, recognizing that giving up power is very hard, and said something like ‘<em>if</em> he does it I take back everything I said about the guy.’
The point is that accepting the limits to authority is hard, but also critical for good leaders.</p>

<h2 id="managing-up">Managing up</h2>

<p>One of the lessons of 2020 is probably that sometimes the only person in the room who can stop a bad outcome is a middle manager,
and often they can only do it by managing up, not through direct action.</p>

<p>Middle managers are frequently in situations where their domain skills are better than senior leadership –
either because they’re technocrats with domain skills,
or because they’re dealing with the problem day-to-day and have better information, or both.</p>

<p>We still get shouted down a lot, resulting in waste:
of money, of time, of resources, of opportunities, of morale.
In a war it can be lives.</p>

<p>We speak out a few times but eventually converge to inaction as your <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">wtfs trail off</a>.
We give up because we’re tired, but that’s not all of it:
We stop arguing because when a leader experiences argument as dissent, their reactions are unpredictable and poison the team.</p>

<p>The way around this way of thinking is to
(1) make very sure that you’re very right when you pick a fight with your boss,
(2) fight for better delegation, not just a correct decision this one time.
And (3) remember that if you succeed, things get permanently better; these are hard fights but companies need them to grow.</p>

<p>Middle managers are the only people who have the authority and connections to fight these fights.
That’s why they leak, that’s why they manage up.
The organization will fail if we don’t.
Employees depend on companies to put food on the table; you do have a moral obligation to help your employer not fail (if you can) (barring circumstances like if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU">you’ve looked at these caps recently</a>).</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/938173926953443328">JAMA article</a> about ‘professional silence’ by doctors.
Silence is not golden when an important argument is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Senior technocrats have a surprising amount of power when they align their story and band together. For Saddam, years into the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iraqi generals blamed Saddam’s military organizational practices for both sets of losses, raising a serious danger of overthrow from within<sup id="fnref:blame" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blame">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his leadership style was in conflict with their technical skills.
He punished losses in ways that deterred ground commanders from requesting backup, creating a losing cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saddam put great pressure on Iraqi commanders on the ground to avoid losses, which led them not to report failures. Withholding losses from reports and thus not receiving reinforcements or other support left commanders in impossible combat conditions. However, this was better than reporting their failures and suffering execution.<sup id="fnref:pressure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pressure">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The command-and-control system was incapable of transmitting the true tactical situation. Senior Iraqi officers later noted that they often got more timely information from the media than they did from their own commanders at the front.<sup id="fnref:media" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:media">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Vietnam, General Phu, a technocrat middle manager who had been brought in to fix the South Vietnamese army’s problems, tried to use his authority to salvage a bad campaign and was talked down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phu, who previously had enjoyed an excellent reputation as commander of the 1st Division, expressed grave reservations about the operation to those around him, complaining that he had done it only because of Thieu’s order<sup id="fnref:reservations" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reservations">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Thieu’s realtime intervention, leading to a bad loss, demoralized him and he was never able to lead again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thieu’s absurd order to withdraw immediately from the Central Highlands essentially caused another corps commander, General Phu, …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>
