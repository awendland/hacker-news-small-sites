			<p>At least a significant portion of their supporters, according to U of Aarhus researchers.</p>
<p>When two competing political parties in Denmark reversed their policy stance on an issue — suddenly they both supported reducing unemployment benefits — their voters immediately moved their opinions by around 15% into line with their party.</p>
<p>The same thing happened when one of these parties shifted from opposing to supporting ending Denmark’s early retirement.</p>
<p>The researchers were studying how public opinion is formed. Their recent paper sheds light on how much influence political parties have over their supporters, according to the researchers, who surveyed their panel of subjects in five successive waves between 2010 and 2011. They studied the same group of party supporters before, during and after a policy reversal.</p>
<p>“We can see that [the] welfare programs were actually quite popular … and many of the voters of the center-right party were in favor of these welfare programs,” commented one of the researchers, Rune Slothuus. “Nevertheless, we can see that they reversed their opinion from supporting these welfare programs to opposing these welfare programs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was surprised to see the parties appeared this powerful in shaping opinions,” Slothuus said. “Our findings suggest that partisan leaders can indeed lead citizens’ opinions in the real world, even in situations where the stakes are real and the economic consequences tangible.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers pondered Western democracy in light of their findings: “If citizens just blindly follow their party without thinking much about it, that should lead to some concern about the mechanisms in our democracy. Because how can partisan elites represent citizens’ views if the views of citizens are shaped by the very same elites who are supposed to represent them?”</p>

    <h3>The brain listens for things it is trying to predict</h3>
    <div><p>The brain interprets sounds as they contrast with its expectations; it recognizes patterns of sounds faster when they’re in line with what it is predicting it will hear, but it only encodes sounds when they contrast with expectations, according to <span>Technische U researchers. </span></p>
<p>The researchers showed this by monitoring the two principal nuclei of the subcortical pathway responsible for auditory processing: the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, as their subjects listened to patterns of sounds which the researches modified so that sometimes they would hear an expected sound pattern, and other times something unexpected.</p>

    <h3>We have a particular way of understanding a room</h3>
    <div><p>When several research subjects were instructed to explore an empty room, and when they were instead seated in a chair and watched someone else explore the room, their brain waves followed a certain pattern, as recorded by a backpack hooked up to record their brain waves, eye movements, and paths. It didn’t matter if they were walking or watching someone else, according to UC researchers led by Dr Matthias Stangl.</p>
<p>The researchers also tested what happened when subjects searched for a hidden spot, or watched someone else do so, and found that brain waves flowed more strongly when they had a goal and hunted for something.</p>

    <h3>Extroverts and introverts use different vocabularies</h3>
    <div><p>Extroverts use ‘positive emotion’ and ‘social process’ words more often than introverts, according to new research conducted at <span>Nanyang Technological U</span>.</p>
<p>‘Love,’ ‘happy,’ and ‘blessed’ indicate pleasant emotions, and ‘beautiful’ and ‘nice’ indicate positivity or optimism, and are among the words found to be used more often by extroverts. So too are ‘meet,’ ‘share,’ and ‘talk,’ which are about socializing. Extroverts use personal pronouns — except ‘I’ — more too, another indication of sociability.</p>
<p>The correlation, however, was small, and the researchers think that stronger linguistic indicators need to be found to achieve their general goal, which is improving machine learning approaches to targeting consumer marketing.</p>

    <h3>WhatsApp is changing today - Users must give the app permission to send their private data to Facebook or lose account</h3>
    <div><p>WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014, but has thrived while promoting itself as a privacy-respecting messaging app that now has 1.5b monthly active users. This week, though, WhatApp sent out an update to users’ phones that they must ‘consent’ to a new policy or lose access.</p>
<p>Whatsapp will now share more of your data, including your IP address (your location) and phone number, your account registration information, your transaction data, and service-related data, interactions on WhatsApp, and other data collected based on your consent, with Facebook’s other companies. Facebook has been working towards more closely integrating Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.</p>
<p>Users who do not agree to ‘consent’ to the new policy will see their WhatsApp account become inaccessible until they do ‘consent.’ These accounts will remain dormant for 120 days after which they will be ‘deleted.’</p>
<p>The biggest change to the user policy, which many people ignored and clicked ‘agree’ to, thinking it was just another unimportant app update message, now reads,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, “about” information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your “last seen”); and when you last updated your “about” information.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, Elon Musk tweeted on the news, saying that WhatsApp users should switch to Signal, one of several popular privacy-focused messaging apps similar to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The data sharing policy change doesn’t affect people in Europe due to GDPR data protection regulations.</p>

    <h3>President Trump silenced on top social media platforms after mob storms Capitol</h3>
    <div><p>The US president was locked out from posting new messages on his Facebook and Twitter accounts after an unruly group of supporters assembled outside the capitol building where Biden’s election win was being confirmed.</p>
<p>The lockdown on Twitter lasted 12 hours until the president removed tweets Twitter said violated its ‘civic integrity policy,’ but Zuckerburg said that Trump would be silenced on Facebook and Instagram for at least two more weeks until his presidential term was over. Facebook and Twitter are two of the main ways the president communicates with citizens and the world.</p>
<p>It is the first time social media platforms have chosen to limit the free speech of such an important figure.</p>
<h6><em>Trump’s tweets from Jan 6, 2020, as recorded by thetrumparchive.com</em></h6>


<p>Many news organizations covered the story using language such as <a href="https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trump-Incites-Rioters.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1324866489" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="15093_15041">‘Trump Incites Rioters.’</a></p>
<p>Following Trumps ‘ban,’ there was renewed talk about treating social media platforms, where people share informative content, as publishers themselves, in part because their algorithms amplify things shared when those things are engaging. There was also talk about how the social media platforms that censored the president’s content did so as a response to content or events but without first drawing their ‘red line’ and saying which content is and isn’t allowed on their platforms.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s staff resigned following the incident at the Capitol building, and there were also a lot of questions why the national guard wasn’t capable of handling the incident properly.</p>
<p>UPDATE January 8: Twitter permanently banned Trump’s account. Google removed Parler, an app like Twitter used by Trump supporters, from the Android app store to make it harder for people to download it, saying Google requires social media apps to have content moderation policies to remove posts that incite violence.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>the below does not explain what Gemini is, but <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">this does</a></strong></p>

<p>Reading people’s gemlogs, I get a sense of a smaller internet. I stumble across an article about Pacific Northwest seaweed, a list of types. Someone else writes her thoughts: “Really, prepare to question groupthink”. A history of adoptable cyberpets. It is addicting to read people’s neat summaries of interests, ascii art embellishments.</p>

<p>But something about it makes me sad.</p>

<p>There’s something called the Eternal September, about how – well, should I be pretending to tell you from the position of someone who’d know? It happened the month after I was born.</p>

<p>Every September before, college students with new network access would stream onto Usenet fora without ever having accustomed themselves to the etiquette. Things would get rowdy and stupid for a while. Then they would learn or get bored and things would quiet down again.</p>

<p>That September, though, was more than just college students – America Online offered Usenet access to all its members. Ever after, the numbers would be dominated by those who had no manners, who didn’t know there was culture to learn. September continued forever.</p>

<p>The design of Gemini isn’t the community. I’m sure there are a few people who use the bridged NPR website available served via Gemini who are really in it because they’re Just That Mad About JavaScript, but those aren’t the people who make the place. It’s a bunch of people who learned a new markup language and installed some new fiddly tools and wrote their journals in plain text and taught me what seaweed is edible… why?</p>

<p>Something about Gemini strikes me as a grail quest for the Eternal August, before webscale crushed the things we love.</p>

<p>While everything I have seen served via Gemini is friendly and sociable, the technical barriers of what-is-a-command-line and how-do-I-use-one are a fence put up that keep out the riffraff. Certainly, you can walk around the corner and go through the gate, but ultimately the geminiverse is lovely because it is underpopulated, slower-paced, and literate. It is difficult enough to access that those who can use it can be welcoming without worrying its smallness will be compromised.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that I don’t think many of its denizens would claim that they <em>only</em> want to hear from technical, educated people, but in order to use a <em>small</em> internet, an August internet, they have let the fence keep out anyone else.</p>

<p>This is the part of the piece where I pivot to My Proposal to Fix Everything, right? Where I tell you about my new community or my idea for what people should be doing or if we only started using tags <em>right</em>…</p>

<p>I don’t know that I think that it’s that neat.</p>

<p>I will probably keep reading things on Gemini, keep querying its search engine for terms and being delighted by neatly crafted plain-text.</p>

<p>But I will probably keep finding it sad.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p><strong>The social media platform Minds had to remove ‘major functionality’ from its Android app after getting a chilling warning from Google. Its co-founder said plans for a censorship-resistant infrastructure are in the works.</strong></p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1196949029506060288" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">post</a>&nbsp;on Friday evening, Bill Ottman said that Minds had received a&nbsp;<em>“24 hour warning”</em>&nbsp;from the Google Play store. This forced them to submit an updated version of the app, based on&nbsp;<em>“interim solution and ninja developers,”</em> which removed the search, discovery and comments functionality.</p>
<p><em>“I know. We aren’t happy and will be working towards something better,”</em>&nbsp;Ottman said.&nbsp;<em>“What is happening on the internet with major providers is fueling the cultural divide as much as anything,”</em>&nbsp;he added.</p>
<p>Operating since 2015, Minds was conceived as a blockchain-based community-owned social media platform that would not monetize user data but enable free speech instead.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minds-anti-facebook/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wired</a>&nbsp;magazine once described it as the&nbsp;<em>“anti-Facebook.”</em></p>
<p><em>Owen is joined by James O’Keefe of Project Veritas, after the explosive video released of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who revealed his true intentions on social media.</em></p>
<p>Ottman advised users to download the app from Minds directly if possible.&nbsp;<em>“If you are on Apple, leave if you’re smart,”</em>&nbsp;he said.</p>


<p>As for going forward, he said a plan for&nbsp;<em>“fully censorship-resistant infrastructure”</em>&nbsp;is coming soon, and that Minds has&nbsp;<em>“multiple escape pods ready to go”</em>&nbsp;if Amazon moves against them.</p>
<p>Ottman’s comments were a clear reference to what happened to Parler. The free-speech social media platform attracted tens of thousands of users purged from Twitter in the wake of the January 6 unrest at the US Capitol – only to be banned from Google and Apple stores, and then taken down from the internet entirely after Amazon Web Services (AWS) denied them access to the cloud. Parler’s executives later revealed that other vendors rushed to jump ship as well, leaving them unable to operate entirely.</p>
<p>Those who complained about the rising tide of censorship have typically been told that the First Amendment to the US Constitution did not apply to private companies and that people should&nbsp;<em>“build their own”</em>&nbsp;platforms if they disagreed. Parler’s shutdown has shown that this is near-impossible when the major players control the internet infrastructure itself, however.</p>
<p>Mainstream media and tech platforms have gone after Parler, Gab, Minds, and Telegram for allegedly having&nbsp;<em>“far-right”</em>users and allowing&nbsp;<em>“hate speech”</em>&nbsp;as content. In Parler’s case, Amazon’s ultimatum demanded moderation policies they would approve of in order to avoid removal from AWS.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit accusing Amazon of breach of contract, antitrust violations and defamation, Parler argued that this was pretextual and revealed that Amazon staff sought to find out if US President Donald Trump – freshly banned from Twitter and locked out of Facebook – had set up an account on the platform.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently started learning the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a> by going through <em>"<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>"</em>, which does a phenomenal job of explaining the language basics.</p>
<p>After working through the book’s main content I got started with my first non-trivial, real-world application.
But I soon found myself faced with a question I didn’t yet feel well-equipped to handle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How should you structure error handling in a mature rust application?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article describes my journey of discovering the answer to this question.
I will try to explain the pattern I’ve settled on together with example code showing its implementation, in the hope that other newcomers may have an easier time getting started.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>While the book goes through the basics of error handling, including use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> type and error propagation with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator"><code>?</code></a> operator, it largely glosses over the different patterns for using these tools in real-world applications or the trade-offs involved with different approaches. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When I began looking into best practices, I came across quite a bit of outdated advice to use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/"><em>failure</em> crate</a>.
<em>Failure</em> had a semi-official feel to it as a result of being in the <code>rust-lang-nursery</code> namespace, but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/pull/347">it has recently been deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a number of improvements to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> trait in the past two years. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
These have made <em>failure</em> less needed in general and have sparked a number of more modern libraries taking advantage of these improvements to offer better ergonomics.</p>
<p>After reading through quite a lot of historical context and evaluating a number of libraries, I’ve now settled on a (largely library-agnostic) pattern for structuring errors, which I implement using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> crates. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The rest of this article will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce a relatively trivial word-counting application to explore and explain the problem space.</li>
<li>Explain why applications and libraries should use different error-handling patterns.</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to apply these patterns using <code>anyhow</code> and <code>thiserror</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="counting-words">Counting words</h2>
<p>Let’s introduce some example code for use throughout the rest of this article.
We’ll build a program to count the number of words in a text file, much like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html">wc -w</a> would do.</p>
<p>A naive implementation with basic error handling using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> might look like this:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s generate an input file for our new word counter and try to run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ fortune &gt; words.txt
$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
50 words.txt
</code></pre><p>If you don’t have a <code>words.txt</code> however, you’ll encounter the following error:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
</code></pre><p>This error is the result of <code>File::open()</code> returning an error in <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>To make the example complete, let’s also <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36f4545f2b994f054a17ac31df07e2f762c6ac24/src/wordcounter.rs#L124-L125">simulate an error</a> in the <code>read()</code> call happening under the hood inside <code>count_words()</code> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> so we can see what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Custom { kind: BrokenPipe, error: "read: broken pipe" }
</code></pre><h3 id="missing-context">Missing context</h3>
<p>So what’s wrong with the above error?
While the underlying error cause (<em>“broken pipe”</em>) is made clear, we’re missing a lot of context.
We can’t tell which file could not be opened and there is no information about the sequence of events leading up to this error.</p>
<p>When you think about it, there’s a chain of errors here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main()</code> returns an error because <code>count_words()</code> returns an error.</li>
<li><code>count_words()</code> returns an error because we run into an error iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> (lines 14-15).</li>
<li>Iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> errors because we injected an implementation of <code>std::io::Read</code> that fails on the first call to <code>read()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we don’t really see this reflected in the error messages above.</p>
<p>In this example the file name is an input argument for the program itself.
This makes it easy to correlate the error to the file it was trying to open.</p>
<p>Now imagine an error happening 5 calls deep inside a library within a much larger piece of software.
Without any information on the chain of events in such a case, it quickly gets very difficult to understand what might be causing the error.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-versus-applications">Libraries versus applications</h2>
<p>Earlier on I mentioned <strong>two</strong> different libraries, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> (though both are by the same author, <a href="https://rustaceans.org/search/dtolnay">dtolnay</a>).
You might be wondering why we need two separate libraries to do something as basic as dealing with errors.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to appreciate this distinction, but there’s value in approaching error handling differently between libraries and applications as they tend to have different concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries should focus on <em>producing</em> meaningful, structured error types/variants.
This allows applications to easily differentiate various error cases.</li>
<li>Applications mainly <em>consume</em> errors.</li>
<li>Libraries may want to cast errors from one type to another.
An IO error should likely be wrapped by a high-level error type provided by the library.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise an IO error in library <code>foo</code> cannot be distinguished from a similar IO error in library <code>bar</code>.</li>
<li>Not doing so also requires the consumer to know library internals.
For example, is it just IO errors that might be returned? What about HTTP errors that might originate from an HTTP client internal to the library?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libraries must be careful when changing errors or creating new errors, as these can easily introduce breaking changes for consumers.
They may produce new errors internally, but these are unlikely to require special structure and can be more easily changed at will.</li>
<li>Where libraries return errors, applications decide if and how those errors are formatted and displayed to users.</li>
<li>Applications may also want to parse and inspect errors, for example to forward them to exception tracking services or to retry operations when doing so is deemed to be safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, and I think this is quite important, <strong>libraries should always use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> together with an error type implementing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> in their public APIs</strong>.
Custom result types like <a href="https://docs.rs/failure/0.1.8/failure/trait.Fail.html">failure::Fail</a> may not compose well with other parts of your user’s code and force them to learn yet another library.</p>
<h3 id="api-boundaries">API boundaries</h3>
<p>Coming back to our word counting example, imagine we want to make <code>count_words</code> available as a public library.
You wouldn’t normally do this for such a small and simple piece of code, but there can be value in making functionality available through public crates within larger projects.</p>
<p>As a demonstration, we can define boundaries in our word counter to separate this code into a library and an application part.</p>
<p>We’ll extract <code>count_words</code> into a <em>library crate</em> named <em>wordcounter</em>.
I’ll highlight relevant parts below, but if you want to skip ahead, you can find the complete <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/wordcounter.rs">src/wordcounter.rs</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Everything outside of <code>count_words</code> is our application code.
This is going to live in a <em>binary crate</em> which we’ll call <em>rwc</em> (for <em>Rust Word Count</em> — very original, I know).
The relevant files for this are <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/main.rs">src/main.rs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/lib.rs">src/lib.rs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-library-error-type">The library error type</h3>
<p>For our <em>wordcounter</em> library, we’ll define a top-level error type called <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36db340c9beaf14032c93f63afcb413f99ec3291/src/wordcounter.rs#L23-L38">WordCountError</a>.
This enum has error variants for every possible error that our library might encounter.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> comes into play.
While we could implement this by hand, <em>thiserror</em> allows us to avoid writing lots of boilerplate code:</p>

</div><p>(Quoting the official documentation: <em>“Thiserror deliberately does not appear in your public API.

<p>With this error type, we can now change the signature of <code>count_words</code> as follows:</p>

		<p>Google’s <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> program protects a lot of people from <strong>phishing</strong>, <strong>malware</strong>, and other harmful sites. In fact, it’s so pervasive that it’s not just used by Chrome. Google has managed to get competing browsers,&nbsp;<strong>Safari and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Firefox,</strong>&nbsp;to use it as well. The list of websites blacklisted though is all maintained by Google, giving Google&nbsp;a&nbsp;disproportionate amount of power over what sites are seen versus blocked.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what happened during our harrowing week in a moment; but first, let me share an <strong>update about Google’s Safe Browsing API</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective September 11, 2019, the <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing">Safe Browsing API</a></strong> is limited to non-commercial use only. It is a free service.</li>
<li>If you’re a <strong>non-commercial user</strong>, you can continue to use the Safe Browsing API, and you don’t need to take any action. Also, a<span data-preserver-spaces="true">cademic researchers and NGOs will continue to be eligible to use the Safe Browsing API at no cost.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Commercial users</strong>, like GMass, are required to switch to the <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/web-risk/">Web Risk API</a></strong> by November 11, 2019. This version is a paid service, and if you’re a commercial user, as we are, then you’ll need to switch. Also, you’ll need to apply and be approved to use the API, so don’t wait.</li>
<li>Both APIs are directed at protecting users from malware and phishing, but the new Web Risk API is designed specifically for larger users.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, back to our story …</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last week, my team&nbsp;suddenly had a deluge of complaints from <strong>users reporting that their links had stopped working</strong>, their <strong>sending limits had been reduced</strong>, and they’d <strong>received phishing notifications from Google</strong>. Ouch! Upon investigating, we found that the tracking domains they use in their email campaigns&nbsp;had ended up on the Google’s Safe Browsing blacklist, and when people clicked links in their campaigns, they ended up on this scary bright red Google warning page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gmail-Dangerous-Warning-Link-Wordzen-Com-web.png" alt="" width="1685" height="613">There’s the rub. <em>Not only does Google list actual phishing sites, but any sites that re-direct to them as well.</em> That makes it so that any providing click-tracking services, including <strong>URL shorteners</strong> and <strong>email marketing service providers</strong>, have to be extra cautious.</p>
<p>In slogging through our logs we found that a Netflix phisher had managed to send 200 emails through GMass on Sunday, February 17. Here’s the email he sent. Notice that the URL behind the link is highlighted at the bottom. In this case, the URL https://www.gregsimages.com/cgi-bin led to the red screen of death, as did our click-tracked links that redirected to this URL.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-Netflix-Email-web.png" alt="" width="1333" height="574"></p>
<h3>The effect of being listed goes beyond just the web</h3>
<p>What happens to your email campaigns when you send a URL that’s on this list? Gmail makes you&nbsp;feel like the devil reincarnate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Gmail account&nbsp;becomes <strong>severely limited</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>unable able to send any substantial volume</strong> of emails.</li>
<li>If you do manage to&nbsp;send an email with a blacklisted link,&nbsp;and that link is clicked, you’ll <strong>scare the&nbsp;bejesus out of them</strong> with&nbsp;the red screen of death.</li>
<li>Your <strong>past campaigns are affected</strong> too, if someone pulls up one of those old emails and clicks a link.</li>
<li>If people <strong>reply</strong> to you, the reply will still have the original email at the bottom, with the link that you sent, and Google <strong>will flag the <em>reply to you</em> as a potential scam</strong> too.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gmail-Dangerous-Warning-web.png" alt="" width="2509" height="1618"></li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously not a good look for an email marketer.</p>
<h3>What was actually affected?</h3>
<p>In our case, when we got the notice that <strong>link.wordzen.com was listed</strong>, I wanted to <strong>isolate which link.wordzen.com URLs were affected</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the public <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en">Safe Browsing lookup tool</a>, which is different from the private tool everyone has in their <strong>Search Console</strong>, I found that plugging in just link.wordzen.com gave this result, indicating that some URLs were affected and others weren’t:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4078"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Safe-Browsing-Lookup-Some-Unsafe-web.png" alt="" width="3168" height="1874"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4078">Just “link.wordzen.com” indicates that SOME pages are unsafe.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But if I plugged in our original click tracking structure, link.wordzen.com/x/c, then the issue was clear that all /x/c links were blacklisted</p>
<figure id="attachment_4079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4079"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Safe-Browsing-Lookup-Unsafe-web.png" alt="" width="3180" height="1798"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4079">Using our old click-tracking link structure shows that all URL redirects using link.wordzen.com are unsafe.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Curious, though, I wondered what would happen if I changed the URL slightly, so I tried link.wordzen.com/x/d and found that those URLs came back clean</p>
<figure id="attachment_4082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4082"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Link-Wordzen-Com-Safe-web-1.png" alt="" width="3180" height="1204"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4082">Slightly altering the link structure makes the link safe again.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll see below that this discovery led me to change the structure of a click-tracked link.</p>
<h3>Some&nbsp;nonsense associated with the Safe Browsing Program</h3>
<h5><span>1. Despite claims of transparency, it’s anything but.</span></h5>
<p>As soon as your domain has been listed, you will probably want to know the URL that caused the issue. Unfortunately for you, <strong>Google won’t tell you</strong>. In the <strong>Search Console</strong> you might see this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Google-Search-Console-Blacklisted-web-1.png" alt="" width="1240" height="942"></p>
<p>If you received an email notification about the blacklisting, that will have a portion of the URL.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4039" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4039"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Social-Engineering-Email-Notification-web-1.png" alt="" width="1132" height="1241"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4039">The email notification you receive provides some clue as to the offending URL, while the notice in the Search Console gives you NO worthwhile info.</figcaption></figure>
<p>For my purposes, this did not help at all, because every click-tracked link in the history of GMass starts with /x/c. The important stuff is all <em>after</em> that part, and that’s the part that Google eliminates from its reports. <strong>How this qualifies as transparency is beyond me.</strong></p>
<p><em>So what do you do now?</em> You crawl through your logs and figure out what happened. In my case, I ran all sorts of analyses, starting with a time distribution analysis of all clicks in the last 72 hours, looking for anomalies. I also discovered my new best friend, a tool from Microsoft called <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Log-Parser-Studio-cd458765">Log Parser Studio</a>, that lets me run SQL queries against my IIS log files, <em>without importing the log files</em> into a database. Slick! That’s how I concluded that the aforementioned Netflix phisher was the culprit.</p>
<h5><span>2. The Safe Browsing API has been broken since day one.</span></h5>
<p>I’m <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-safe-browsing-api/pdVIo3qXsGk">not the only one</a>&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;frustrated over&nbsp;the seemingly useless <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/">Safe Browsing API</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot showing the listing of link.wordzen.com.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Google-Search-Console-Blacklisted-web.png" alt="" width="1240" height="942"></p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot showing the API result:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-API-Fail-web.png" alt="" width="2121" height="969"></p>
<p>So with a useless API, how does one monitor whether new URLs have been listed or old URLs have been marked safe? I used Upwork to quickly a hire a team of <strong>Virtual Assistants in the Philippines</strong> to <strong>manually enter all 1,400</strong> of our customers’ tracking domains into the web lookup tool and to do so <strong>every 12 hours until further notice</strong>.</p>
<p>In case you’re a C# programmer and want to try this yourself, here’s the code:</p>
<pre><span>            string</span><span> apikey = </span>"AIzaSyBnIDLCc*************z4twxdx28"<span>;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span><span>string</span> payload = <span>@"{</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""client"": {

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""clientVersion"": ""1.0.0""
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>},

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""threatInfo"": {
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""threatTypes"":<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>[""MALWARE"", ""SOCIAL_ENGINEERING"", ""UNWANTED_SOFTWARE"", ""POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION""],
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""platformTypes"":<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>[""WINDOWS""],

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>]
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>}
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>}"<span>;</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>using</span> (<span>var</span> client = <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span>())
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>{
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>var</span> content = <span>new</span> <span>StringContent</span>(payload, <span>Encoding</span>.Default, <span>"application/json"</span>);
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>var</span> response = client.PostAsync(<span>$"https://safebrowsing.googleapis.com/v4/threatMatches:find?key=</span>{apikey}<span>"</span>, content).Result;
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>string</span> resultContent = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>}</pre>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/safebrowsing/v4">.NET client library for the Safe Browsing API</a>, but I chose not to use it because I wanted to be&nbsp;in control of the exact JSON payload request&nbsp;so that I knew that I wasn’t making a mistake.</p>
<h5><span>3. Reviews take a long time to process.</span></h5>
<p>Despite <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked/request_review">Google’s claims</a><strong> that a phishing URL will be reviewed within 24 hours</strong> and a <strong>malware&nbsp;URL&nbsp;within 72 hours</strong>, I found it <strong>took more like 120 hours (5 days)</strong>. After a week of hell though, there’s no sweeter email one can receive than this, clearing your&nbsp;domain off the dreaded blacklist:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-Review-Successful-web.png" alt="" width="943" height="786"></p>
<p>You can submit each URL for review, and in our case, we did it for hundreds of our customers too.</p>
<h3>How&nbsp;I worked around the blacklisting of 300 domains</h3>
<p>During the time our customers’ domains were listed, we couldn’t just sit idle&nbsp;waiting for Google, because customers needed to&nbsp;send their email campaigns out. We took a number of counter-measures and you can take these too, should you find yourself in this situation.</p>
<h5><span>1. Removed&nbsp;all affected customer tracking domains from their accounts</span></h5>
<p>The first step we took was to remove all the affected tracking domains from users’ accounts, causing them to fall back to our shared tracking domain, which for paying users, is a clean domain based on Amazon’s AWS domain. That eliminated the issue in future campaigns.</p>
<h5><span>2. Altered structure of click tracking link</span></h5>
<p>I felt a little shady making this change system-wide, but it turned out it worked, and saved me from an ever-growing mob of angry users. The old structure of a click-tracked link looked like:</p>
<pre>http://link.wordzen.com/x/c?c=2724793&amp;l=dedb940f-55dd-4c33-a3cc-f5d8028183ca&amp;r=ed06197e-cf9e-4fea-a371-d5f455968519</pre>
<p>By&nbsp;plugging various combinations of URL structures into the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en">lookup tool</a>, we noticed that the link above was flagged as dangerous, but if we made a simple change, changing the /c to /d, then the URL came back as safe, so we changed the structure of links to use /d instead of /c, like this:</p>
<pre>http://link.wordzen.com/x/d?c=2724793&amp;l=dedb940f-55dd-4c33-a3cc-f5d8028183ca&amp;r=ed06197e-cf9e-4fea-a371-d5f455968519</pre>
<p>Of course for backward compatibility, we made sure that the /c URLs still worked also.</p>
<p>Making this change allowed users to keep using their custom tracking domain, even if their tracking domain was still listed in the Safe Browsing system as a potential phishing domain.</p>
<h5><span>3. Locked down how click-tracking works to prevent future issues</span></h5>
<p>I should have implemented this from day one, but I could have never expected an evildoer to exploit this loophole. You may know that to set up a custom tracking domain, you create a sub-domain off your existing domain and set its CNAME to x.gmtrack.net. So in my …</p></div></article></div>

This computer has no microprocessor.  The CPU is discrete TTL logic.
<p><img alt="Mark 1 FORTH Computer" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Rack1_40.jpg" width="900" height="500">
</p><p>I bought my first TTL data book in 1979.
I was learning 6502 machine code at the time and dreamt of building a simple TTL CPU.
I sketched some circuit ideas; but that was as far as it went.
Now, 25 years later, I've finally done it!
Working evenings and weekends, the Mark 1 took a month to design, 4 months to build and a month to program.
Here's the result:</p><p>
<img alt="Recursive factorial demo" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Factorial.gif" width="652" height="331">
</p><p>
<b><tt>Myself</tt></b> is a standard way to implement recursion in FORTH.
Even if you're not familiar with FORTH, if I tell you it's a stack-based language, and uses reverse polish notation (RPN), you might be able to figure out how this works.

<h3>µ-Instruction Format</h3>

<p>
The Mark 1 is a micro-programmed machine with a highly encoded "vertical" microcode.
The microinstruction (µ) is only 8-bits wide.
One normally thinks in terms of "horizontal" microcodes, which are wider and less encoded.
Some are very wide indeed.
The Mark 1 is more like a RISC processor.
</p>

<p>The 8-bit µ-instruction (µ) is encoded as follows:</p>

<p>The source and destination fields of the move instructions are coded as follows:</p>

	<table>

	<tr><td>000</td><td>W</td><td>W</td></tr>
	<tr><td>001</td><td>IP</td><td>IP</td></tr>

	</tbody></table>

<small>TOS = Top of parameter stack; R = Top of return stack</small>

<p>The Mark 1 executes 1 µ-instruction per clock cycle (1MHz).</p>

<p>Decoding is done centrally using 74HC138 1-of-8 decoders.
Decoded control signals are distributed via the back plane.
Simple gating is then required at card level to complete the decoding.</p>

<p>The conditional is a skip not a branch.
It inhibits loading of another µ-instruction for a specified number of cycles if the test is true.
The skip distance is decremented to zero at which point normal execution resumes.</p>

<p>The "µPC←OP*16" instruction (1011xxxx) a.k.a. XOP loads the uppermost 8-bits of the program counter (µPC) from the operand register.
It's a form of indirect jump.</p>

<p>The other jump instruction (1001xxxx) has a 4-bit operand and can only reach the first 16 bytes of the µ-ROM.</p>

<p>
The 74181-based ALU requires 8 control signals.
These are decoded from the 4-bit ALU function field in the µ-instruction using a 7x16 diode matrix ROM.
The shaded squares indicate positions where diodes are fitted:</p>

<p>FLAG selects sign or overflow testing.
Sign testing routes the most significant bit of the ALU result to the conditional test multiplexer.
Overflow testing required the addition of a quad-XOR gate.
The 74181 does not generate an overflow signal (the later 382 variant does).
This was not used in the end because FORTH implements signed comparison by testing the sign of the result after subtraction.</p>

<h3>Backplane</h3>

<p>The Mark 1 is housed in a 3U 19"
IEC297 sub-rack with a 64-way DIN 41612 backplane.
The bus layout is shown below.
The "A" row resembles a standard 8-bit microprocessor bus.
The "C" row carries the µ-instruction and various decoded control signals.
The fully-bussed pins (1, 2, 31, &amp; 32) carry power supply and clocks.</p>

<p>The clocks are in quadrature.
CLK1 <strike>rises</strike>falls at the beginning of the machine cycle.
CLK2 is used to generate write-enable signals for the RAM and I/O.</p>

<p>All control signals are active low.</p>

<h3>Microcode sequencer</h3>

<p>The sequencer has a 12-bit micro-program counter (µPC).
The uppermost 8-bits can be loaded from the OP Latch, effecting a jump to one of 256 microcode routines.
Each routine starts on a 16-byte µ-page boundary.</p>

<p><img width="554" height="152" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Sequencer.gif" alt="Sequencer block diagram"></p>

<p>Opcodes, the machine language of the macro-machine, are loaded into the OP latch from the data bus under
micro-program control.  They can be fetched from memory using one of the index registers as a program counter.
A simple <i>micro-interpreter</i> consists of the following 3 µ-instructions:</p>
<div><pre>OP←Memory[Index]     Load OP latch from memory
Index←Index+1        Increment "program counter"
µPC←OP*16            Execute microcode routine
</pre></div>
<p>How do these 3 µ-instructions get executed?
One possibility is to append them to the end of every µ-routine.
A slower but more space-efficient option is to append a jump to them.
Mark 1 microcode has a jump specifically for this.</p>

<h3>Virtual machine</h3>
<p>It's possible to customise the the instruction set and thereby create a "virtual machine".</p>
<p>Opcodes can have zero, one, or more operands.  
The µ-routines consume operands by incrementing the program counter.
During development, I used this two-operand POKE instruction to test the UART.
This expects a 16-bit address followed by a data byte:</p>
<div><pre>Poke:    Index.Lo ← Memory [PC]        ; Address LO
         PC ← PC+1
         Index.Hi ← Memory [PC]        ; Address HI
         PC ← PC+1
         Temp ← Memory [PC]            ; Data byte
         PC ← PC+1
         Memory [Index] ← Temp         ; Do the POKE
         Jump Next
</pre></div>
<p>The Mark 1 was designed to support the FORTH virtual machine.
The following FORTH primitives are micro-programmed:</p>

<tt>
EXIT LIT EXECUTE
BRANCH 0BRANCH (LOOP) (DO) U* U/ AND OR XOR LEAVE R&gt; &gt;R R 0= 0&lt; + D+
MINUS DMINUS OVER DROP SWAP DUP @ C@ ! C! (DOES)
</tt>

<h3>Forth model</h3>

<p>My original plan was to build a subroutine-threaded FORTH.  High-level definitions were to be called explicitly, primitives were to be compiled inline:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>: Foo  DUP SWAP DROP ;</tt></td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>: Bar  OVER Foo ROT ;</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>Foo:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_DUP, OP_SWAP, OP_DROP, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Bar:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_OVER, OP_CALL</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DW Foo</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DB OP_ROT, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I abandoned this idea because most FORTHs use indirect threading and I wanted a full-featured standard FORTH with all the usual compiler facilities.
Many compiling words are tightly coupled to the indirectly threaded model.</p>

<p>Indirectly threaded code is a list of execution tokens.
An execution token is a code field address.
The code field is a pointer to machine code.
This presented a problem on the mark 1 because it has separate macro and micro address spaces.
What should go in the code field?
My solution was to shorten it to 1 byte and store the opcode:</p>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Subroutine-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Indirectly-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to learn the math involved with the Big O, read  <a target="_blank" href="https://thatcomputerscientist.com/analysing-algorithms-worst-case-running-time">Analysing Algorithms: Worst Case Running Time</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Structures and Algorithms is about solving problems efficiently. A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn't even know why their solution is inefficient. So, the question is, <em>How do you rank an algorithm's efficiency?</em></p>
<p>The simple answer to that question is the <strong>Big O Notation</strong>. How does that work? Let me explain!</p>
<p>Say you wrote a function which goes through every number in a list and adds it to a <em>total_sum</em> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610785957976/1d53AER34.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.02.19 PM.png"></p>
<p>If you consider "addition" to be 1 operation then running this function on a list of 10 numbers will cost 10 operations, running it on a list of 20 numbers costs 20 operations  and similarly running it on a list of n numbers costs the <em>length of list</em> (n) operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786373466/WWOOmyjH9.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.01.09 PM.gif"></p>
<p>Now let's assume you wrote another function that would return the first number in a list.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786595803/WcObNzV40.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.09.39 PM.png"></p>
<p>Now, no matter how large this list is, this function will never cost more than one operation. Fairly, these two algorithms have different <strong>time complexity</strong> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of operations executed</em>. We communicate these time complexities using <strong><em>Big O Notation</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to the complexities as <em>'<strong>n</strong>'</em>, common complexities (ranked from good to bad) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant - <strong>O(1)</strong></li>
<li>Logarithmic <strong>O(log n)</strong></li>
<li>Linear - <strong>O(n)</strong></li>
<li>n log n - <strong>O(n log n)</strong></li>
<li>Quadratic - <strong>O(n²)</strong></li>
<li>Exponential - <strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></li>
<li>Factorial - <strong>O(n!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610787546688/SufUcCJVY.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.23.08 PM.png"></p>
<p>Our first algorithm runs in <em>O(n)</em>, meaning its operations grew in a linear relationship with the input size - in this case, the amount of numbers in the list. Our second algorithm is not dependent on the input size at all  - so it runs in constant time. 
Let's take a look at how many operations a program has to execute in function with an input size of <em>n = 5 vs n = 50</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td></td><td>n = 5</td><td>n = 50</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(1)</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(log n)</strong></td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n)</strong></td><td>5</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n log n)</strong></td><td>20</td><td>300</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n²)</strong></td><td>25</td><td>2500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></td><td>32</td><td>1125899906842624</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n!)</strong></td><td>120</td><td>3.0414093e+64</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It might not matter when the input is small, but this gap gets very dramatic as the input size increases. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610788579877/ejJP5RkiF.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.33.46 PM.gif"></p>
<p>If n were 10000, a function that runs in <em>log(n)</em> would only take 14 operations and a function that runs in <em>n!</em> would set your computer on fire!</p>
<p>For Big O Notation, we <em>drop constants</em> so <em>O(10.n)</em> and <em>O(n/10)</em> are both equivalent to <em>O(n)</em> because the graph is still linear. </p>

<p>Big O Notation is also used for <strong>space complexity</strong>, which works the same way - <em>how much space an algorithm uses as n grows</em> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of space needed</em>.</p>
<p>So, yeah! This has been the simplest possible explanation of the Big O Notation from my side and I hope you enjoyed reading this.

history going back to <a href="https://gist.github.com/spences10/5c492e197e95158809a83650ff97fc3a/revisions?page=2#diff-0517f094a4805e87e00d10b2891d99e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the start of 2017</a>.</p><p>As this list started to grow I also had other areas that I needed to
keep these little one-liners to hand, git being the largest but other
things like <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/mac/#screen-snip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to screen snip</a> on macOS and <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/bash/#kill-process-on-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill a process</a> with
bash, all started adding up.</p><p>I moved them all into <a href="https://github.com/spences10/cheat-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one repository</a> for ease of access for me.
These later were added to <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Sheets</a>.xyz</p><h2 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a>Notion</h2><p>Back when Notion was the new hotness and I jumped onto it as soon as a
discovered how flexable it was and more importantly cross platform, so
I could take notes on my phone, work laptop and personal computer yay
🎉</p><p>I used it for stashing ideas for later, todo lists, shopping lists,
kanban boards and the 100s of links that I thought looked interesting
but didn’t have time to read it there and then so stashed them in the
Notion links database (never to be seen again 🤣).</p><p>Downsides, the search wasn’t great, that’s been improved in recent
iterations but was quite annoying when you wanted to find something
quickly.</p><p>The Android version just straight up stopped working, I couldn’t use
it and the general feeling from Notion was meh!</p><p>I learned the hard way about differing Markdown versions with this too
after making a 8k word post in Notion then copy pasting into VSCode to
find all the artifacts for code snippets and word formatting
throughout.</p><p>Getting my data out of Notion was straightforward enough but what I
was left with was a but of a mess. Because of the nesting you were
able to do with pages in pages the export was a mess of files with
hashes appended to them which is going to take a while to untangle.</p><h2 id="roamresearch"><a href="#roamresearch" aria-label="roamresearch permalink"></a>RoamResearch</h2><p>Roam RoamResearch was a different way of logging notes, the default
was to open you on a daily notes view where you’d add your notes and
you could then move these into more long form documents with the help
of the graph behind it which helped you link information with
backlinks (<code>[[example backlink]]</code>) with the intention of helping you
collate information from differing sources.</p><p>The odd bit was that you could only add in a bullet fashion, so if you
want to add a code block it always looked weird inline of a unordered
list.</p><p>It got a bit weird and culty, I always get a bit wary when companies
start referring to their users/employees as tribes, “Roamers”,
“Googlers”, no thanks.</p><p>That along with starting it and staring at the rotating logo for an
age waiting for it to start, not helpful when you want to take a note
quickly.</p><p>Getting my data out of there was a straightforward button click
though.</p><h2 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a>Obsidian</h2><p>Obsidian, the free (or one off licence payment) offering that is a
standalone app, much like Notion (which I know is web based too)
available on macOS, Windows and Linux.</p><p>The idea is that the notes you take are hosted locally on your
machine, no central storage location like with Notion and
RoamResearch.</p><p>With Obsidian you are in direct control of the Markdown, store it
wherever you like.</p><p>This brings up questions about how and where you store your data, I’ve
now added all the exports from Notion and RoamResearch to a git
repository which is on a private GitHub repo.</p><p>This is nice, there’s an import option for Roam exports, you can
configure your daily notes location and it has a super nice graph
view.</p><p>This experience felt a lot like working in VSCode, but it wasn’t
VSCode! 😬</p><p>I’m very comfortable with editing Markdown in VSCode and felt a bit
cheated when I couldn’t select a tab or move lines around.</p><h2 id="foam"><a href="#foam" aria-label="foam permalink"></a>Foam</h2><p>So, Foam! <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foam is a VSCode extension</a> that enables the features of
Obsidian but with the editing power of VSCode, so no brainier, right?</p><p>Foam are the first to admit that <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things may be a little rough</a> as
it’s still in preview. But I <em>really</em> like working with my Markdown in
VSCode so I’m prepared for the teething issues.</p><p>There’s a <a href="https://discord.gg/rtdZKgj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super welcoming Discord</a> to join and talk to other users
and the developers.</p><p>With my new liberated data from Notion and RoamResearch I’m in the
process of working through all this data which is easy to visualise
with the VSCode file explorer and built in graph view of Foam.</p><p>The Foam graph view is still a WIP so I’m referring to Obsidian to
check that out for now.</p><p>I’m super excited following the progress of this!</p><a href="#top-of-page" aria-label="back to top navigation"><p>Back to Top</p></a></article><div><p>If you're interested in occasional updates from me about what I'm working on and want useful information you can sign up to my newsletter.</p><p>Important dev related content, directly to your inbox (for free).</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨</span>I'm giving away sticker packs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to a randomly chosen newsletter subscriber. 👇</p><p><a href="https://scottspence.com/newsletter">Newsletter signup...</a></p></div></div>]]>

<article>
    
    <div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p>How much does a line of code cost?</p><p>The naive answer is that it costs nothing. Bytes are free -- or as close to free as we can come. But it <em>has</em> to cost something. After all, it took time to type in, right? So that takes us to our first rule of "Code Economics": the cost of a line of code is measured in how much time we spend working with it.</p><p>How much value is in a line of code?</p><p>The naive answer is that the economic value of a line of code is the value of the application (which can be measured various ways) divided by the total line-of-codes (LOC). If you're making $10K per month from a thousand lines of code, each line is bringing in $10.</p><p>But that's obviously not true. We know that the same application can be written using a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred thousand LOC. The thing the application does for people -- its value -- and the amount of code it takes to write it? They're not related at all. That takes us to the second rule of "Code Economics": a line of code has no value whatsoever. It only has value as part of some deployable application. The application is the smallest unit of economic value. (Actually, it's UX flow, but for our purposes today an application supports one UX flow that the user finds value interacting with.)</p><p>The value of an app is more directly measurable. Yes, sometimes it gets more complicated, like if the business purpose of the app is in-app purchases or referrals, but at some point money comes in and we can trace that money back to the app.</p><p>How about the cost of a line of code? Is it just the time we spend typing it in? That's obviously wrong. You have to design it, even if only in your head. You have to test it. You have to deploy it. In fact, once you start thinking about it, there's no limit to the amount of money you can spend on a line of code. If your app is successful, you might spend the rest of your lifetime maintaining that line of code -- looking at it every now and then, tweaking it, changing how it's used.</p><p>Of course, most lines of code either work fine or they never provide enough value to make anybody bother with them again. (No economic value = no technical debt) But, assuming you know enough to write an app that has value, each line of code in that app has an potentially-infinite cost.</p><p>So value comes in app-sized chunks while costs is related to the tiny pieces we use to make that app -- and to a large degree this is under our control.</p><p>We have a way in finance of dealing with things that have a limited value but a potentially-unlimited downside. We use a budget. I could go out next month and buy $500 worth of sugar-free bubblegum (I love the stuff), but I don't. I have a budget of $10 per month and I stick to it. That's not because bubblegum is such a huge drain on our finances. It's because little things add up. Without a budget, I have no reasonable way for my wife and I to discuss what's important to us. The budget isn't important. The conversation about values it drives is irreplaceable.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/code-budgeting-tablets.png" alt=""></figure><h3 id="so-why-aren-t-we-budgeting-our-code">So why aren't we budgeting our code?</h3><p>So far in our discussion, there's really no reason to pick one set of budget numbers over another. Should we limit our applications to a million lines of code? A hundred? We don't know. We can safely say two things. One, given the same value, more code equals more cost. Two, lines-of-code always grows out-of-control the more we poke at it. This leads to the conclusion in the third rule of Code Economics: the only way to limit the costs of solving a problem using programming is to arbitrarily limit the amount of code humans have to mentally-manipulate solving it.</p><p>In a way, this is all common sense. We've been doing it for years. We just haven't been explicit about it. Shared libraries, frameworks, industry standards, and a dozen other things all exist in an effort to limit the amount of code humans have to mentally-manipulate to solve problems.</p><p>So why haven't we succeeded? Why can't most programmers today do their job using four or five lines of code?</p><p>Because lines-of-code always grows the more we poke at it. When the http protocol first appeared, if you wanted a web page? You brought up a terminal and telnetted a small number of commands. Boom, there's your webpage. Now, there are easily 10, maybe 20 various standards and libraries related to what used to be 10 seconds of work. Fifty years from now there will be 40 standards. Same value, more code. Value stays the same, cost of code continues to increase.</p><p>I'd like to suggest a completely random rule that I just made up: <em><strong>Arbitrarily limit lines of code used to solve a problem and write the app with the goal of never touching it again</strong></em></p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-17-16-code-budget-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>No matter what your tech or stack, in general, costs rise as a function of the amount of code you write and later have to maintain</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-18-51-code-budget-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>The application's value to the user, however, remains constant</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-19-37-code-budget-3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>That means that there is some unknown point at which the amount of money/effort you've spent to provide the value is the same as the value it provides. Afterwards, the costs rise steeply. There is no feedback or mechanism to spot the crossover point</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-19-37-code-budget-4.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Providing some arbitrary limits to the amount of code you're willing to create and maintain, even if it's past the break-even point, is the only way to prevent long-term runaway costs</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, since I'm making stuff up, how about a 2000-200-20 rule for folks writing microservices? Whatever problem you have to solve using microservices, you have 20 microservices to solve it in. Each of those microservices can be written with no more than 200 lines of unique code.</p><p>But wait, I hear you say. That's never going to work! Okay, so among all of those microservices you can have 2,000 lines of code in a shared library. Anything you could ever touch counts as code.</p><p>I'm not going to defend my made-up rules aside from saying that budgets always seem arbitrary, and it's not right to create a budget so small that the work can't get done. I don't believe I've done that here -- but I might be wrong! Use other budgets if you like. Hell if I care. But use budgets.</p><p>Most programmers probably don't think such a budget is fair, or workable. And I think it's fine. That's fascinating to me and indicates a lack of alignment somewhere in the way we train and socialize programmers.</p><p>I'm also suggesting a new thing that has to happen: a code budgeting discussion. Yes, Daniel, your WhizzBang widget is freaking awesome, but it uses 500 lines of code, and that's 500 lines we can't afford right now.</p><p>Whoa horsey! Wouldn't I love to hear somebody actually say that! Cost control, in a programming team. Imagine that! And what would come next? I have no idea!</p><p>But I could guess.</p><p>Don't some problems require a lot of code? Don't some applications -- most, in fact -- require us to come back to them again and again in order to keep them in alignment with changing user needs?</p><p>Both statements are true. For complex things, we write components. Those components have executing tests that describe them and are used/shared in multiple places. The more they are used/shared, the better they get. That means that components are just another project. It also means that if you don't have multiple teams using your component, you don't have a component. Component creation should be a decision made between teams and involve a completely new project. After all, they have both cost and value.</p><p>What about coming back to tweak the app as the business needs change? Assuming you have a release that is currently demonstrating value -- a big assumption, by the way -- I think you have to timebox it. Three months of verifying that the app got things mostly right. After that? You write a new app, of course. With the budget we're talking about it's not going to be a huge effort, you've already been living in this space, and it's good to rethink things. Code budgets and timelines prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System Syndrome</a>. (I think we went off-the-rails somewhere with Second System Syndrome, but I digress)</p><p>There are parts of this essay that are completely made-up. I tried to point those out. There are also parts that are built on decades of experience both coding solutions and watching teams work. What I've seen over-and-over again is that really cool things happen with smart people and creative constraints. Really stupid stuff happens otherwise, because without constraints it's all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bike shedding</a>.</p><p>You need to start budgeting your code.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/Daniel-Signature.png" alt=""></figure>    </div>

<p>For the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tomlooman.com/stanford-cs193u/" target="_blank">Stanford University Fall 2020 Curriculum</a>, I built a small game project using mainly C++ mixed with some Blueprint in Unreal Engine. For those interested, the entire Computer Science course (CS193U) was provided through Zoom lectures and has been recorded. I’m working on getting this published and meanwhile, this project is already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">open-source through GitHub</a> to be taken apart by anyone! </p>

<p>The game was built with a wide set of features to cover a variety of useful coding concepts to students including AI, multiplayer programming, save games, async asset loading, etc. Check out the non-exhaustive list of features below, I’m sure there is more that I forgot to include or that will drip in at a later time.</p>
<p>Those interested in a GAS (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gameplay Ability System</a>) style design might be keen to check out how we handled Abilities (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SAction.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Action.h</a>) and Buffs/Debuffs (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SActionEffect.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActionEffect.h</a>) as this shares many similarities with GAS design, albeit its much simpler.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there isn’t a whole lot that makes this a real ‘roguelike’ with things like permadeath or proper RNG. But, I hope to extend this project later on with more relevant features to have a proper game loop to earn the name ‘Action Roguelike’.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Below I’ve listed some of the more relevant features included in the project. I think these code samples can be invaluable in getting an idea on how to use them in the Unreal Engine eco-system.

<p>There is still a decent chunk of features I would like to add, including adding a proper game loop, items/abilities, Steamworks, etc. Whether these will actually see the light of day depends on many factors – including the final shape of the existing course recordings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>
