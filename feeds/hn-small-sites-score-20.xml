<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I'm forever looking for where Henry Miller's Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don't want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p>First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_35196"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_33388"><div><p>I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn't a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple's three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p>They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn't strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn't in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p>What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren't interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14048"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14342"><div><p>Some years later I had a friend who worked at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/" target="_blank">Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</a> on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock</a> and his wife, fellow artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner" target="_blank">Lee Krasner</a>, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" target="_blank">Peggy Guggenheim</a> provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_45411"><div>

The organic locavore caterers and spa treatments were still decades away. So were the exquisite country estates that now populate the forest. Miller and the oddball collection of pre-hippie touchy feely types were there because it was beautiful and cheap.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_55944"><p>Miller’s first few books were banned in the United States because they were too racy for American culture at that time. He was on his third wife when he settled in at Big Sur and that marriage ended in divorce as well. Once his two children were grown he was an older man living in a small cottage in the forest alone much of the time. Miller helped establish the mystique of Big Sur, but the wealth that followed made his lifestyle difficult for others to replicate on a normal budget.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_59524"><div>

<p>The last year has been particularly annoying for nocoiners—those of us who don’t hold crypto and view bitcoin as a Ponzi, like a Ponzi, or <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme/">something more complex</a>.</p>



<p>We have had to endure Tether minting tethers with abandon ($17 billion worth in 2020 alone) and bitcoiners obnoxiously cheering bitcoin’s new all-time highs, the latest being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever">$33,000</a>. Considering bitcoin began 2020 at around $7,500, that is a long way up. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/">Things went full crazy in March</a>.) But we believe 2021 will be a year of comedy gold when this giant hill of dung all comes tumbling down.  </p>



<p>I’ve spoken with several notable bitcoin skeptics, gathered their thoughts, and compiled a list of new year predictions. They shared their prophecies on Tether (a stablecoin issuer that has so far minted $21 billion in dubiously backed assets to pump the crypto markets), new regulations and the future of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is what they had to say:</p>



<h2><strong>Nicholas Weaver: T’will be the year the music stops</strong></h2>



<p>“This is the year the music stops,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told me.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5212" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/nicholas-weaver-2/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nicholas-weaver-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="257" height="257" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=257 257w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Weaver has been following bitcoin since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. He believes the bitcoin ecosystem is running low on cash. (This is the fate of all Ponzi schemes. Ultimately, they run out of new investors and when that happens, the scheme collapses.) In the case of bitcoin, he believes real dollars in the system are rapidly being replaced by fake ones in the form of tethers.</p>



<p>“Tether has been squeezing every dollar out of the system, and there aren’t enough suckers,” he said, meaning there aren’t enough folks waiting in line to buy bitcoin at its ever increasing prices. “When the dollar stock goes to zero, the system will collapse completely because you get a mining death spiral.”</p>



<p>Miners reap 900 newly minted bitcoin per day in the form of block rewards. If they can’t sell those for enough fiat money to pay their monstrous power bills, it makes no sense for them to stay in business. And since their job is to secure the bitcoin network, bitcoin will become vulnerable to repeated attacks.</p>



<p>Also, governments are finally waking up, said Weaver, alluding to new global efforts to clamp down on money laundering, capital outflows, and the financing of terrorism via cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He foresees Tether getting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a> any day now. He also thinks China will decide “screw it, bitcoin is evading capital controls as a primary purpose, let’s cut off the subsidized electricity.” </p>



<p>Without cheap electricity, bitcoin miners—most of whom are in China—may find it difficult to stay afloat.&nbsp;Already bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia <a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity">no longer receive electricity at subsidized rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jorge Stolfi: I can’t make price predictions</strong></h2>



<p>A computer science professor in Brazil, Jorge Stolfi wants to avoid making predictions on bitcoin’s price. He’s been following bitcoin since 2013—and has seen it through two prior bubbles—so he knows too well that anything can happen. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="5227" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/stolfi/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="stolfi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“I really don’t know how far the insanity can go. The crypto market is 100% irrational, sustained entirely by ignorance and misinformation,” he said. “How can anyone make predictions about that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi is a denizen of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/">r/Buttcoin</a>, a subreddit that makes fun of bitcoin, where he painstakingly explains the finer points of crypto nonsense to the unenlightened. In 2016, he submitted a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/srcboebzx2018040-4064523-169183.pdf">letter</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warning against the risks of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and comparing bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. (The SEC has shot down every bitcoin ETF proposal to date on the basis that bitcoin’s price is too easy to manipulate.)</p>



<p>“And since price determines everything else in the crypto space, I can’t make predictions on pretty much everything else,” Stolfi continued. “For example, If the price were to crash below $10,000, I bet that we would have a lot of comedy gold coming from MicroStrategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the enterprise software company, has funneled $1.2 billion of its funds into bitcoin. As a result, Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, now spends most of his time on Twitter shilling bitcoin.&nbsp;In September, Saylor <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1307029562321231873">compared</a> bitcoin to “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.”</p>



<p>Stolfi also thinks that we will probably forget about several coins that were big in the past, like Bitcoin SV (BSV) and IOTA, maybe even bitcoin cash (BCH). “And we will also forget about blockchain technology.”</p>



<h2><strong>Frances Coppola: Crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last week, Frances Coppola has been battling an army of bitcoin trolls and sock puppets on Twitter after suggesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/status/1345395222243586050">bitcoin is not scarce</a> in any meaningful sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scarcity is a key part of the myth bitcoiners perpetuate to make people think bitcoin is valuable in the same way gold is and to create a sense of buying urgency—quick, grab some before it’s all gone!—so naturally, bitcoiners responded by dog piling on her. She isn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope bitcoin crashes and burns because I am so bloody furious, but I think it will be a while yet before it does—maybe about June,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coppola is a UK-based freelance writer, who spent 17 years in the banking industry. She wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Peoples-Quantitative-Easing/dp/1509531300">The Case For People’s Quantitative Easing</a>,” and has 58,000 Twitter followers.</p>



<p>The cause of bitcoin’s upcoming crash, she believes, will be an epic battle between the Wild West of crypto and regulators, a topic she covered in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-financial-system-fight-it">Coindesk article.</a></p>



<p>If the regulators win, crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks and have to comply with things like the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping law that reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crash, she said. On the other hand, if the regulators lose, she believes their next move will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>“We’d see drastic restrictions on what interactions banks can have with crypto, perhaps a total ban on retail-deposit-takers having crypto exchanges and stablecoins as clients,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might also see something akin to a Glass-Steagall Act for crypto exchanges and stablecoins, so that retail deposits are fully segregated by law from trading activity.” By that, she means exchanges won’t be able to lend retail deposits to margin traders or use them to fund speculative positions in crypto derivatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>David Gerard: Bitcoiners will get their big boy wish</strong></h2>

<p>After years of begging for bitcoin to be taken seriously as a form of money, bitcoiners will be getting exactly what they asked for, said David Gerard, a bitcoin skeptic and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Shrugged-Facebook-Tried-Money-ebook/dp/B08KK9SZP6">“Libra Shrugged,”</a> a book on Facebook’s attempt to take over the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year will see more regulation of crypto, as coiners discover to their dismay just how incredibly regulated real-world finance is, he said. “Just wait until someone sits them down and explains regulatory real-time compliance feeds.”</p>



<p>What does Gerard think about Tether? “I could predict the guillotine will finally fall on Tether, but I predicted that for December 2017, and these guys are just amazing in their ability to dodge the blade just one more day,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2018, the New York Attorney General has been investigating Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud. Over the summer, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the companies need to hand over their financial records to show once and for all just how much money really is underlying the tethers they keep printing. The NYAG <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">said</a> Bitfinex/Tether have agreed to do so by Jan. 15.</p>



<p>Gerard also foresees that there will continue to be no use cases for crypto that absolutely anything else does better. “Everything the <a href="http://buttcoinfoundation.org/">Buttcoin Foundation</a> was talking about in 2011 is still dumb and broken,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk says he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-highly-confident-spacex-will-land-humans-on-mars-by-2026.html">“highly confident”</a> that his company SpaceX will be sending humans to Mars in six years. Naturally, Musk wants to set up a self-sustaining city on the red planet. And, come to think of it, the city will need its own crypto, something like Dogecoin or <a href="https://www.marscoin.org/">Marscoin</a>. Otherwise, how else will its citizens pay for things?</p>



<p>Pseudonymous crypto blogger Trolly McTrollface has this prophecy for 2021: “Elon Musk creates its own cryptocurrency, and adds it to the<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $TSLA</a> balance sheet. It ends the year in the top 10 crypto list by market cap.”</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, doesn’t mince words when it comes to crypto predictions. He simply told me: “The Bitcoin bubble will burst in 2021. Triggers will be reg/law enforcement action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is good reason to take him seriously. Roubini famously warned of the 2008 financial crisis, a prophecy that earned him the moniker “Dr. Doom.”&nbsp;He is also <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/dr-doom-s-bubble-burst-nouriel-roubini-s-hot-tub-gets-heave-ho">known for his parties</a>, which leads a few of us nocoiners to believe that bitcoiners’ are fundamentally driven by bitterness over the fact that we have better soirées.</p>

<p>If the past is any prediction of the future, bitcoin and other crypto promoters will continue to deceive the public with outright lies about “investing” in tokens until the big tokens collapse. That’s the view held by David Golumbia, known for writing about the cult of bitcoin. He is the author …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Obsidian is described as “A second brain, for you, forever”. It is a desktop app (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that acts as a knowledge base working on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>



<p>The app is developed by the hugely talented Licat (Shida Li) and Silver (Erika Xu) who also brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynalist</a>&nbsp;(an outliner note-taking tool similar to <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">Logseq</a>).</p>



<p>The app is offered as a free download, although sponsoring the devs is possible by upgrading your license through a one-time payment (USD 25+). By upgrading the license, we gain insider builds (early releases) and access to the exclusive dev channel on Discord.</p>



<h2>Why Obsidian?</h2>



<p>Your notes are saved locally on your machine in plain text markdown format, allowing you to easily transfer your notes to other apps or open them with Notepad, in essence, there is no vendor lock-in. You are in complete control of your notes and files and can use Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox etc. to sync your notes between different machines.</p>



<p>Having control over my notes gives me peace of mind. I am free to do what I want with them, and even though with the Obsidian app I can use various functions (backlinks, graph view, etc.) I know that should the app disappear, the content is mine and will forever be mine.</p>



<p>The ease of using the app could not be more straightforward. Once downloaded and installed, you are greeted with a welcome screen similar to the one below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="650" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>From here you can either create a new vault (notes repository) or open an existing vault. You can also open the “help vault” which includes several help files such as a formatting guide, and appearance customisation guides amongst other how-tos.</p>



<p>Once you have created / opened a vault, you can start taking notes at your heart’s content. You are free to choose to structure your notes the way you wish. You can have folders similar to traditional note-taking tools or go structure free and store all your notes in one main directory.</p>



<p>The beauty of creating links between your notes (with a simple [[“name”]] link) means that you should always be able to find what you are looking for and generate ideas (see <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">Personal Knowledge Management</a>) from your notes.</p>



<p>The app works in markdown format with the possibility of rendering the preview side by side, as shown below. You can also have more than one note open simultaneously by opening additional panes that can be infinitely split and resized. This is great if you want to cross-reference notes or create a work product from multiple notes.</p>

<p>The markdown format may feel a little overwhelming at first, but things get easier after taking a few notes. The other benefit of having notes in markdown or rendered view is that it is easy to copy and paste the text into an online blogging platform or a Word document. For instance, I created this post in Obsidian and copied and pasted the text to WordPress and voila.</p>



<p>Having said the above, the lack of a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type interface is a little annoying in my point of view. Sometimes the markdown format is confusing to read, or if you are in preview mode, you need to go back to edit mode to tweak the text. The good news is that this is on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>. Fingers crossed this comes soon.</p>



<p>In addition to the devs being hugely talented and ever-present to answer questions and chat on the Discord, the speed of development is phenomenal. Nearly every other week, we are presented with an update that includes new features and bug fixes.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>



<p>There are a significant amount of features available in Obsidian, so I thought to include below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Offline – <em>can access whether connected or not. Notes are stored offline and are yours</em></li><li>Backlinking – <em>easily see which pages link to the page</em></li><li>Random Note – <em>opens a random note which is useful for discovering old content</em></li><li>Daily Note – <em>create today’s note at the click of a button</em></li><li>Starred Notes – c<em>an star “favourite” notes for easy access</em></li><li>To-do list – <em>easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Outline – <em>see the structure of your note and easily navigate to other sections by clicking</em></li><li>Search – <em>easily find what you are looking for</em></li><li>Graph View –&nbsp;v<em>isualise a page or your notes collection in a graph with many different filter / view options</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video I did of the main features available in Obsidian.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the above main features, there are a couple of additional features which warrant a separate mention. These are:</p>



<h2>Publish</h2>



<p>A useful feature of Obsidian is Obsidian Publish where you can take your notes and convert them into an online digital garden / blog. The simplicity of doing this through “no code” means that there is no prior technical knowledge required. You only need to sign up (USD 8 per month per site (early-bird price)), choose a name, select which notes to publish and there you have it – your own personal online space.</p>



<p>The outcome can look something like this <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>. Developments are in the pipeline to allow for custom domains and other tweaks to make it more personal and improve the experience.</p>



<h2>Plugins</h2>



<p>With the ability to install and use third-party plugins and such a large community of users, many plugins are available to choose from to customise the app to suit your needs. The plugins are easily installed in the app (simply click install on the plugins browser page within Obsidian) and allow you to do things like:</p>



<h3>Mind Map</h3>



<p>View your note as a mind map. For example, activating the mind map view on this article results in the following diagram:</p>







<p>I find this plugin great as although you can see the note’s outline using the Obsidian outline feature, this allows you to visualise it differently.</p>



<h3>Calendar</h3>



<p>Enables a Calendar View to visualise and navigate between daily notes and easily create a daily note for a past, or future date.</p>







<h2>Areas of Improvement / Wish List</h2>



<p>There are a few areas of improvement which I feel would elevate the app even further. These improvements include:</p>



<ul><li>A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type editor interface,</li><li>Mobile app to view / take notes on mobile,</li><li>Ability to see more information on notes in bulk (like date created, last modified, word count).</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a few tweaks and the addition of a WYSIWYG interface, this app has the potential to become a top note taking app. Notes are stored locally, so are yours and forever yours. The features available in the app allow you to take notes, visualise your notes and generate ideas easily.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is meant to help find clues as to who is calling you when you’re receiving calls from an unknown phone number (a number that is displayed on your phone’s screen, but you don’t recognize).</p><p>It’s quite short and simple, and I hope it helps, as it’s written with the intention of tracking whoever may be bothering or harassing you.</p><p>First I’d like to clear up the following meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>unknown phone number</strong> – a phone number that is displayed on my phone’s screen but I don’t have the caller’s information</li><li><strong>private phone number</strong> – a number that’s not displayed on my screen when someone is calling because the caller is withholding their number.</li></ul><p>I wanted to quickly clear this up because I suspect some interpret the term of <strong>unknown phone number</strong> as <strong>private phone number/call</strong>, and I don’t want to take up someone’s time with information that’s not useful to them.</p><h2 id="method-1-finding-the-facebook-account-associated-with-the-unknown-number">Method 1 – Finding the Facebook account associated with the unknown number</h2><p>With this method we’ll try to have Facebook show us the account associated with the phone number by trying to login with it and then clicking <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Forgot Password?</code>, which will lead us to the next page where Facebook shows us the associated account.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert in this area. Although I don’t think that investigating an unknown phone number in this manner is an offence in any way, I do think you should proceed at your own risk.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that even though this method probably has a good chance of working, the number may not be associated with a Facebook account.</p><p>Also, since it will look like you’re trying to log in, Facebook will probably notify the user in some form. In my case I just got notified that I can enable one click login, for security reasons.</p><p><img width="593" height="532" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" alt="word image 7" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 12" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w"></p><p>I’m not certain of other cases, however.

Add the unknown number to your contact list</h3><p>I assume it doesn’t have a high success rate, but it’s pretty low effort and I think it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Just add the phone number to your contacts under whatever name you’d like, and then look up that contact in WhatsApp to check out if they have a profile pic.</p><p>That profile pic may be either a selfie or something that can help you identify if you know that person.</p><h3 id="2-reverse-image-search-the-profile-picture-video">2. Reverse Image Search the Profile Picture [Video]</h3><p>If you think the image is not very generic, and it’s likely they used it on other websites, such as social media, you can also perform a reverse image search using <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a> and see if something comes up.</p><p>I know this is probably nothing new, but an additional thing you can do is limit the image search to a specific site.</p><p>For example if you search someone’s profile picture and get a good deal of results with all sorts of websites, and additional similar images that aren’t an exact match, you can limit the search to just one social media site, such as Twitter.</p><p>To do this you use the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:example.com</code> operator.</p><p>For example if we want to limit our reverse image search to Twitter, we’d search for the image first, and then replace the existing text in the Google search bar with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code></p><h4 id="quick-demo-video-2">Quick Demo Video</h4><p>The steps are:</p><ol><li>Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a></li><li>Drag the image onto the search bar, or click the little camera icon and insert the URL to the image, or select <strong>Upload an image</strong> and then <strong>Choose File</strong> and then browse for the picture on your computer.</li><li>Next, Google will show us what matches were found.I’ll use this website’s social media profile pic as an example.<p>As you can see, Google sees our profile pic as being similar to many other images, and provides a list of many other websites associated with those images.</p><p><img width="665" height="683" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="word image 12" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 19" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w"></p></li><li>Since we’re interested in mainly social media websites to have a good chance of identifying someone, we’ll filter the results by limiting the search only to Twitter, in this example.<p>You can, of course, try other social media websites popular in your region.</p><p>So in the search bar we’ll just remove the text, in this case <strong>digital alberta</strong>, and replace it with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code>.</p><p>After the search is complete, we can see that even though it’s not the first result, we’ve still found the Twitter profile associated with the image.</p><p><img width="732" height="1270" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" alt="word image 13" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 20" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w"></p></li></ol><p>I hope these methods come in useful or give you some peace of mind in some cases when you’re having issues with numbers you don’t recognize.</p><h2 id="other-methods">Other Methods</h2><p>Here I’ll just list other methods that could work.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>Every time I go back to Rust, I have to figure out how the module system works again. Here are some of my notes comparing it to Python’s module system.</p>

<p>These notes are for Rust 2018.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#crates" id="markdown-toc-crates">Crates</a></li>
  <li><a href="#packages" id="markdown-toc-packages">Packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-layout" id="markdown-toc-file-layout">File layout</a>    <ul>
      <li><a href="#crate-roots" id="markdown-toc-crate-roots">Crate roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="#module-lookups" id="markdown-toc-module-lookups">Module lookups</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nested-modules" id="markdown-toc-nested-modules">Nested modules</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crates">Crates</h3>

<p>A <strong>crate</strong> is a build target in Rust. A crate can either be a library or a binary. It can be built with <code>cargo build</code>.</p>

<p>In Python, libraries are called “packages”. Binaries are an entirely heterogenous concept, typically installed by configuring <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>. Such a binary doesn’t even need to be Python code (for example, it can be a shell script instead).</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>A <strong>package</strong> in Rust consists of up to one library crate and any number of binary crates. (It’s required that there be at least one library or binary crate.)</p>

<p>In Python, a single “distribution package” (i.e. one that you can <code>pip install</code>) can contain multiple “import packages” (i.e. one that you can <code>import</code>), while Rust allows at most one import package per distribution package.</p>

<h3 id="file-layout">File layout</h3>

<h4 id="crate-roots">Crate roots</h4>

<p>Python places <code>__init__.py</code> at the root of a package to indicate that it’s importable as a package. Similarly, Rust conventionally puts <code>lib.rs</code> at the root of a crate as the library <strong>crate root</strong>. (Unlike Python, the name can be re-configured, but <code>lib.rs</code> is the default.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>__main__.py</code> corresponds to the main entry point for the module when run with <code>python -m</code>. Rust conventionally puts <code>main.rs</code> as a binary crate root. (This can also be renamed, which is probably desirable if you have more than one binary.)</p>

<h4 id="module-lookups">Module lookups</h4>

<p>In Python, all modules are available by importing them via their filesystem path name. For example, <code>import foo.bar</code> first looks for a <code>foo/</code> directory on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Then it looks for a <code>bar/</code> package or a <code>bar.py</code> module underneath the <code>foo/</code> directory.</p>

<p>In Rust, modules also correspond to their paths on the filesystem (by default; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute">you can use the <code>path</code> attribute</a> to change this behavior). However, they are not immediately <code>use</code>-able just because the corresponding file is present! They must be declared with a <code>mod foo;</code> declaration in the crate root file (e.g. <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>

<h4 id="nested-modules">Nested modules</h4>

<p>In Python, a nested module <code>foo.bar</code> is implemented either by <code>foo/bar.py</code> or <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code>. You can’t use both. If you want to have sub-modules of <code>foo.bar</code>, you’ll place additional modules or packages under <code>foo/bar/</code>.</p>

<p>A statement like <code>from foo.bar import qux</code> could either be importing a symbol declared in <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code> or the module <code>foo/bar/qux.py</code>. Some developers choose to explicitly re-export the public interface of <code>bar</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> for clarity, and prefix sub-modules with underscores (e.g. <code>_qux.py</code> instead of <code>qux.py</code>).</p>

<p>In Rust, you use <code>foo/bar.rs</code> to declare members of the namespace <code>foo::bar</code>. If you also want to have sub-namespaces of bar (e.g. <code>foo::bar::qux</code>), then you additionally create the <code>bar/</code> directory alongside <code>bar.rs</code>. To access a sub-namespace <code>qux</code> inside <code>bar.rs</code>, the line <code>mod qux;</code> must be added to <code>bar.rs</code>. (This is similar to how we have to add <code>mod foo;</code> at the top-level <code>lib.rs</code>.)</p>

<p>To re-export the namespace and make it available to all users outside of <code>bar</code>, it should be changed to <code>pub mod qux;</code>.</p>

<p>The main take-away is that Rust requires the explicit re-exporting of nested modules using <code>mod</code> at each step of the hierarchy, while Python does not.</p>

</p>
<p>This Christmas, a family member sent me a <span>URL</span> to a family Zoom call. However, they didn’t send me a direct link to Zoom. Instead, they sent me a<span></span> <span>“</span>tinyurl.com” link.</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link, my <span>URL</span> bar flashed an intermediate domain that was neither Zoom nor TinyURL. Later, I used cURL to see where this <span>URL</span> was really going.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v https://tinyurl.com/examplezoom
...
&gt; GET /examplezoom HTTP/2
&gt; Host: tinyurl.com
...
&lt; location: https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC</code></pre>
<p>
<em>(all <span>HTTP</span> responses abridged for clarity)</em>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the redirect wasn’t clean at all. TinyURL was first sending me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigLink" target="_blank">VigLink</a><a href="#footnote-1WA7" id="ref-1WA7"><sup>1</sup></a>. VigLink is an advertising (tracking) company that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Following the redirect in cURL reveals another unsavory fact. VigLink <em>sets cookies</em> before they send me to the intended destination on Zoom.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v <span>'https://redirect.viglink.com?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC'</span>
&gt; GET /?key=a7e37b5f6ff1de9cb410158b1013e54a&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F123456789&amp;prodOvrd=RAC HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: redirect.viglink.com
...
&lt; Set-Cookie: vglnk.PartnerRfsh.p=; Domain=.viglink.com; Path=/; SameSite=None; Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; Secure
&lt; Set-Cookie: vglnk.Agent.p=v-c935c520ecc561fe60a9418874e023b7; Domain=.viglink.com; Path=/; SameSite=None; Expires=Mon, 01 Feb 2021 16:52:34 GMT; Secure</code></pre>
<p>These cookies give them the ability<a href="#footnote-2WA7" id="ref-2WA7"><sup>2</sup></a> to track me across every other site that uses their advertising tech. Who knows what VigLink is doing with my data, but I personally wouldn’t trust an advertising company to keep my browsing history to themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they didn’t give me a chance to opt-out of this tracking. I’m currently based in Europe and I would expect to see at least an interstitial asking for consent to be tracked. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">TinyURL’s privacy policy</a>, last updated in 2012, has no mention of either third party data-sharing nor the cookies they share from affiliates.</p>
<p>This isn’t a phenomenon limited to TinyURL. More common <span>URL</span> shorteners like t.co (Twitter) and bit.ly set cookies when you click on a link. While neither redirect you to an advertising company like TinyURL, Twitter’s primary business model is advertising, and <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank">bit.ly’s privacy policy</a> says they share data with third parties to<span></span> <span>“</span>…provide advertising products and services…”</p>
<p>Don’t use <span>URL</span> shorteners. And if you click on a link from a <span>URL</span> shortener, I recommend using tools like the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/" target="_blank">Temporary Containers Firefox extension</a> to limit the scope of ad tracking. Personally, I took the time to send Sovrn (VigLink’s parent company) a <a href="https://ylukem.com/files/_viglink-gdpr-email.png"><span>GDPR</span> request</a>, and made sure to give them my tracking cookie. I’ll update this blog and <a href="https://ylukem.com/newsletter">my newsletter</a> if I actually get anything substantive back.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  		<p>At around this time last year, I was being flooded with various articles on new year's resolutions and yearly summaries - as is typical in early January. I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my 'roadmap to becoming a better human' google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I'm making <em>most</em> of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year's resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<h4>You did what!?</h4>
<p>I logged my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<p>Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just "Life"):</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/spreadsheet_banner.png" alt="A screenshot of a google sheet I used to track my data with different activities coloured differently" title="Life"></p>
<h3>Why would you do this!?</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn't sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into <em>quality</em> time.</p>
<p>It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p>
<h3>Ok, sure, whatever. How much effort did this take?</h3>
<p>Not that much actually!</p>
<p>When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p>
<h4>Technicalities</h4>
<p><a href="#data">I don't care, I want to see the data.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn't want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</li>
<li>I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBUFCJGVL73kFvD0yO5e63fLfRuebemcqhnQoafXad4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.
For me, the categories were:
<ul>
<li><strong>sleeping:</strong></li>
<li><strong>focused work</strong> - what I really understand as productivity:
<ul>
<li><strong>uni</strong> - university (until June) and PhD (since October)</li>
<li><strong>self-improvement</strong> - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</li>
<li><strong>organising</strong> - things like organising events for a society, conferences and other extracurricular things</li>
<li><strong>German</strong> - to track language learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>low-focus work</strong> - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn't require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</li>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let's use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p>
<h4>What did I do in 2020?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/year_props.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time in total I spent on different activities"></p>
<p>Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I'm very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can't decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.
The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p>
<p>Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as 'extra days' on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn't spend them on human function.</p>
<p>Some of the categories from the plot above were divided into more helpful subcategories:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/High_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within focused work">
<img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Low_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within low-focus work"></p>
<p>By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p>
<p>Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a <em>lot</em> of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/culture.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within culture"></p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I'm quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads<sup id="fnref1">
<a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can't really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the 'documentaries' are really just Louis Theroux and I don't regret a single minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Quality.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within quality time" title="Other quality time subcategories"></p>
<h4>How did the time spent on different activities change over the months?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/hrs_per_month_timeline.png" alt="A stacked plot showing how the average daily hours spent on different activities changed throughout the months"></p>
<p>As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can quite clearly identify the 'hard lockdown' times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master's thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p>

<h4>Hacking my monkey brain to increase productivity</h4>
<p>As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.
Inspired by <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">this post</a> I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.
I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun <em>now</em> and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.
Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</li>
<li>3 points for reading books</li>
<li>2 points for reading blogs, listening to podcasts, lower intensity work etc</li>
<li>0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</li>
<li>-4 points for procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are my points for this year:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points.png" alt="A calendar with days coloured according to the amounts of points I got on a given day"></p>
<p>and their distributions throughout the months:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points_per_month.png" alt="A plot of the distributions of points throughout the months"></p>
<p>Turns out my monkey brain is <text><strong>crazy</strong> </text> about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, …</p></article></div>

source code on laptops. Development happens strictly on workstations inside
their private networks, with some using their text editor’s support for
remote file editing and others running editors on those machines via SSH.</p><p>Adapting to this situation has indirectly led me into a bit of a rabbit
hole, forcing me to acknowledge my core values, better understand the
relation between progress and human flourishing, and ponder about the
question: why technology?</p><p><em>(Chapters are mostly self-contained.)</em></p><h3 id="the-computing-experience">The computing experience</h3><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 3: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 3: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p><h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><h3 id="searching-files">Searching files</h3><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root
for a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if
the buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it
return <code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote
buffers.</p><p>Emacs</p></div></div>

Anyone with a reference to the original can always count on it being the same.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>my-vector</code></pre><p><code>conj</code> returns a new vector with the arguments appended.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-new-vector <span>(</span><span>conj</span> my-vector <span>"four"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>my-new-vector<br></code></pre><p>The original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector<br></code></pre><p>Functions like <code>reverse</code> return a new vector, rather than mutating the original.</p><pre><code><span>const</span> myArray <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>"two"</span><span>,</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><br>myArray<span>.</span><span>reverse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>myArray</p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> my-vector <span>[</span><span>"one"</span> <span>"two"</span> <span>"three"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>reverse</span> my-vector<span>)</span><br></code></pre><p>Our original vector is unchanged.</p><pre><code>my-vector</code></pre><p>This encourages us to use compositions of functions instead of functions that mutate objects. The benefit of this might not be immediately obvious, but this shift encourages writing programs in a way that's simpler. Programs made up of small reusable components are easier to change later. We just need to focus on the scope of the function, the inputs, and the outputs. We don't need to worry about prior state.</p><p>The first thing you will notice in Clojure is how many parens there are and how dense the code is. It takes some getting used to, but the parens have a lot of benefits.</p><p>We can always rewrite syntax repetition with macros and there are plenty of techniques for reducing the number of parens including "threading" operators like <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>. The following is equivalent to the header.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span> but<br>     there<br>     are<br>     so<br>     many<br>     parens<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Function calls are different in Clojure than most languages. It is represented by a list where the first element is the function and the rest are the arguments to that function.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> arg1 arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>The syntax is extremely regular. It's natural to wrap a function in another function.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>my-function <span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span> <span>"third"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span>my-if <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span><span>(</span><span>arg1<span>,</span> arg2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>arg1<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg1<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg2<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>not</span> <span>(</span>blank? arg1<span>)</span><span>)</span><br>     arg1<br>     arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted or use a transpiler but in Clojure it could by implemented by anyone as a library.</p><pre><code>messages <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><br><span>go</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> messages <span>&lt;-</span> <span>"ping"</span> <span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>msg <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;-</span>messages<br>fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span>def c <span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>go</span> <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>!</span> c <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>!</span> c<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Clojure is really good at extracting data from maps and sequences. It is a really good for "data programs", that are mostly calling an API, transforming a sequence, and calling another API.</p><h2>Positional Destructuring</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> large-list '<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>]</span> large-list<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2>Destructuring with named optional parameters and defaults</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> configure <span>[</span><span>val</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span><span>:keys</span> <span>[</span>debug verbose<span>]</span><br>       <span>:or</span> <span>{</span>debug <span>false</span><span>,</span> verbose <span>false</span><span>}</span><span>}</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>"val="</span> <span>val</span> <span>" debug="</span>debug <span>" verbose="</span>verbose<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>configure <span>"foo!"</span> <span>{</span><span>:debug</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Having a fast feedback loop is crucial to be productive. When I first started programming I would write some code, compile, then manually test my changes, maybe with a debugger. Then I discovered TDD with an auto test runner, which gave me a faster feedback loop, since I could be reasonably confident my program worked without having to recompile for every change. The fastest feedback loop I've discovered so far is the Clojure REPL with editor integration. With Emacs and CIDER I can execute code in my editor as I write it. Having a fast feedback loop for exploratory coding before writing tests helps me be a lot more productive and write higher quality code. Other languages also have REPLs but I feel Clojure is uniquely well suited to this workflow because of its immutable functional nature.</p><p>Testing is simpler when most things are maps and pure functions. This is an example from the "Gilded Rose Kata".</p><pre><code>    <span>@Test</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span><br>        <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span> qualityControl <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>shouldNeverIncreaseQualityToMoreThanFifty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>Item</span> backstagePass <span>=</span> <span>anItem</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>withName</span><span>(</span>BACKSTAGE_PASS_ITEM_NAME<span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setSellIn</span><span>(</span>FIVE_DAYS<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setQuality</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        qualityControl<span>.</span><span>updateQualityFor</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        <span>assertThat</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>.</span><span>getQuality</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>is</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> max-quality-pass<br>  <span>{</span><span>:quality</span> <span>50</span><br>   <span>:sell-in</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><p> <span>(</span>deftest test-backstage-pass-peak<br>  <span>(</span>testing <span>"Quality never goes over 50"</span><br>    <span>(</span>is <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>50</span> <span>(</span><span>:quality</span> <span>(</span>i/update-item max-quality-pass<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Clojure has good interop with the worlds most popular languages. You can tap into the Java ecosystem for foundational libraries like the AWS SDK or database clients. Clojurescript has an excellent wrapper around React called Reagent. You can write your entire stack in Clojure, meaning a single person can be extremely productive. The interop story isn't perfect though: although it works technically, the difference between the programming models does have some friction. This can usually be solved by writing a wrapper.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>System/getProperty <span>"java.vm.version"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now that Moore's Law is ending, we can't rely on speed increases of a single core anymore. We need to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and that can correctly run in parallel. I don't feel good about using some languages like Python or Javascript that are single inherently single threaded. Languages like Java or C++, which weren't designed with concurrency in mind are hard to use correctly. Clojure's data structures are thread safe by default and it has numerous concurrency primitives. The language design de-emphasis the us of state and emphasizes the use of values instead.</p><p>I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. If you use types you have to consider their downsides and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program. After using Clojure, I find things like the "builder pattern" contrived. There is usually only a few types of true "data" and the rest of the program are subsets and combinations of the data, which don't always deserve an explicit name or type. I feel using languages that encourage classes encourages you to make abstractions too early, and making the wrong abstraction is much worse than repetition. A lot of the "bugs" you catch at compile time are often self inflicted bookeeping mistakes due to the increased complexity. I think testing is a much stronger form of software validation and will catch the errors that types would have.</p><p>The design choices and tradeoffs in Clojure were made deliberately. There are much fewer sharp edges and historical accidents in Clojure than any other language I've used. Clojure is opinionated on the way you write software but if you buy into that opinion, using pure functions and immutable data structures, the experience is very streamlined.</p><p>I remember having to learn the difference between comparing primitives and objects in Java. Code like this feels unintuitive.</p><h2>Equality</h2><pre><code><span>Integer</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>Integer</span> b <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a <span>==</span> b<span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Comparing object equality is almost never what I want to do and I don't think it's a good default behavior.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>===</span> <span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This does what I expect, and I don't need to know the difference between <code>=</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>deepEqual</code>, and <code>deepStrictEqual</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is only <code>=</code> for structural equality and no assignment operator.

              <p>I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. Often they result in conflicts and people being offended by others' behavior.</p><p>Some people take action and implement their idea. Act fast, fail fast, and learn quicker. But this doesn't work when two or more people discuss how to implement a change or use new hyped technology. When people only talk a bit and implement a new hype, it often ends up with resentment. When we act and embrace failing that fast, we cannot keep someone accountable.</p><p>On the other hand, some people try to get everyone's confirmation to implement something that affects a large group. This strategy doesn't work either. Because it's impossible to get everyone on the same page, each person has a different opinion. When we try convincing everyone, we cannot implement anything at all. We just talk, and decisions come later than we need.</p><p>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process. I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called <strong>Request For Comments (RFC). </strong>It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language.</p><p>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has <strong>a specific timeframe</strong> and <strong>everyone can give feedback</strong> on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted <strong>publicly</strong>. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.</p><p>While the initial goal of the RFC is collecting feedback, I think it achieves a way more significant benefit by only <strong>writing the document itself</strong>. Writing shapes thoughts. Everyone has an opinion on any topic. But people who write their ideas form them into great content that is based on the facts.</p><p>Writing helps to clear the mind. When we write on any topic, we separate our proposal from ourselves. It's still part of us. But since we plan to present it to the public and leave it there forever, we start being careful. And most of the time, we are not starting with blank white paper.</p><p>The RFC processes use either a template or follow one standard style in documents. The aim is to help the authors to explain their plan in a structured way and, at the same time, make giving feedback easier. Each section of the document has its own goal, which helps separate the intent from the idea in a certain way.</p><p>We used <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/educ303x/wiki-old/uploads/Main/SRI_NABC.doc">the NABC model from Stanford</a>. The model starts with defining the <em><strong>N</strong></em>eed, followed by <em><strong>A</strong></em>pproach, <em><strong>B</strong></em>enefits, and lastly, <em><strong>C</strong></em>ompetitors. Separating the Need from the Approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages. Since most people focus on them when they talk about ideas, it's also easy to write. Then the competition section comes. It is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it's not the only one.</p><p>Everyone has different needs. Therefore the formats might differ. Our manager at work also came up with a way more straightforward structure with only four questions to answer. It was only for our team, while the engineering department had the RFC process for a wider audience.</p><p>The RFCs have another effect on the organization. The process seeks a <strong>consent-based </strong>environment,<strong> not a consensus-based </strong>one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.</p><p>The process brings <strong>accountability</strong>, as well. Whoever writes the proposal should be kept accountable. When people know that they will be accountable, they tend to approach more carefully and consider different aspects seriously. Holding someone accountable doesn't mean that there will be a blame in case of failure. It only means that they have to follow up on their proposals, make sure it results in some way, and answer questions on the way. Also, most of the time, the RFC process is separated from the implementation process. While the author is accountable for the RFC itself, the implementation can be done by different people, and the RFC author might not be involved in it at all.</p><p>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates. The culture changes with it as well. Instead of endless debates, we create discussions and solutions based on facts. The process prevents people from talking and doing nothing. Even though the RFC process might not be perfect itself, writing is enough to halt the endless and meaningless discussions. It also helps build trust in the community. So, if you are new to the RFC system, start with writing down your proposal. I'm pretty sure that the result will be way better than expected.</p><hr><p>Check out the comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149">HackerNews</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@30daysreplay">30daysreplay Marketingberatung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>

January 3, 2021 | https://varlink.org/FAQ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://varlink.org/FAQ">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <h2 id="what-does-varlink-provide">What does varlink provide?</h2>

<p>Everybody understands it. Varlink uses a simple human and machine readable <a href="https://varlink.org/#interface">text file</a> to
describe an interface with all its data types, method calls and errors. The text file, in its simplicity,
does not require any specific knowledge to join a discussion about design, development, and
maintenance of an API.</p>

<p>It documents itself, in the sources and on the wire. Varlink interfaces describe themselves readable to
humans and reliably consumable by machines. Varlink services are introspectable at runtime. Varlink
interfaces provide their documentation along with the interface description.</p>

<p>Everything is readable. Varlink uses plain text messages, has no magic numbers, no unnamed values, is
easily debuggable with things like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>,
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>

<p>Varlink itself is simpler than the service that uses it. Varlink uses direct connections, has no
central message handling component, it is easily debugged, secured, isolated, tested.</p>

<h2 id="which-transports-can-be-used-to-speak-varlink">Which transports can be used to speak varlink?</h2>

<p>Varlink can be implemented on any connection-oriented transport.The most common example are streaming
sockets, but it can also be implemented on kernel special files like device nodes or encapsulated in
other protocols, like HTTP, GSS-API or SASL.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-monitor-changes-or-subscribe-to-signals">How can I monitor changes or subscribe to signals?</h2>

<p>Varlink connections can be turned into monitor connections, they are soft-negotiated between the
client and the service. The client asks the server to possibly reply with more than one reply, the
server replies and indicates that it might have more replies and the client should wait for them.</p>

<p>To avoid race conditions between the reading of the current state and subscribing to updates, a
typical varlink monitor method call first returns the current state and then sends changes in
subsequent replies to the same request on the same connection.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-sequence-numbers-in-calls-and-replies">Why are there no sequence numbers in calls and replies?</h2>

<p>Varlink operates on connections, all messages are strictly in order on the same connection and always
received in the order they are sent. Connections support message pipelining, but not multiplexing.
Complex interfaces can use multiple connections at the same time.</p>



<p>The varlink message <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> can be extended by vendors if needed. Added keys should use
the reverse-domain notation including the vendor’s name. The concept is similar to the X-prefix used for
HTTP headers, but neither they nor naked keywords should be added by vendors, since they may clash with
other vendors or future varlink protocol specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-records-separated-by-a-nul-character-and-do-not-specify-a-length">Why are records separated by a NUL character and do not specify a length?</h2>

<p>The simplest possible transport of varlink messages is a raw streaming socket, which forwards JSON
records separated by a NUL character. Conceptually the NUL character belongs to the transport not to
the varlink message. If varlink messages are encapsulated in HTTP, HTTP will specify the record length
and not use a NUL byte.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-unsigned-integers-and-why-are-there-no-integer-sizes-specified">Why are there no unsigned integers, and why are there no integer sizes specified?</h2>

<p>Like JSON, varlink is intentionally underspecified in this regard. The implementation should use
integers large enough to carry the signed integer value, and return an error if it cannot handle the
received number.</p>

<h2 id="the-varlink-type-system-specifies-features-which-do-not-directly-map-to-json-how-are-they-serialized">The varlink type system specifies features which do not directly map to JSON, how are they serialized?</h2>

<p><a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Enums</a> are serialized as a JSON name/value pair, with the enum value as a
string. <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Maps</a> are serialized as JSON objects, every map element is
represented as a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-transmit-file-descriptors">Can I transmit file descriptors?</h2>

<p>Varlink intentionally does not support features or side-effects specific to transports. Encapsulating
varlink messages in other protocols, passing them over proxies is a requirement of varlink.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-reference-a-file">How can I reference a file?</h2>

<p>Varlink should be remotable, therefore you should not point a remote service to a file, which is local
to the client. Just send the content and an identifier/name of the file.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-transfer-larger-amounts-or-foreign-data">How can I transfer larger amounts or foreign data?</h2>

<p>You can either send the data as a string, or use the “upgraded” connection feature, where you opt-out
of the varlink protocol after calling a method with the <code>upgrade</code> <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> field set
to <code>true</code>. After sending this message the connection is yours for sending whatever you want. To
speak the varlink protocol to the service again, you need to open a new connection. Upgraded varlink
connections are similar to the websocket concept.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-a-oneway-request-useful">When is a <code>oneway</code> request useful?</h2>

<p>Setting <code>oneway</code> in a <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">method call</a> means that the service will not send a reply. This
might be useful when many messages are sent as part of one transaction, and only one single reply is
needed to confirm the transaction. It might also be useful for non-critical data like a debugging
interface, to minimize round-trip handling.</p>

<p>The most important reason to add this feature right from the start is, that it could not be added to
the protocol at a later time, because all implementations need to support it right away to correctly
handle the strict message ordering requirement.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-error-numbers-or-human-readable-messages-in-errors">Why are there no error numbers or human readable messages in errors?</h2>

<p>Varlink errors are interface-specific and identified by a string. If required, Interfaces could add a
<code>message</code> field to the error parameters which contain human readable text. The primary focus of
varlink errors is machine consumption, in most cases a carefully chosen descriptive CamelCase error
sufficiently describes the error to humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-service-which-implements-a-local-interface">How do I find the service which implements a local interface?</h2>

<p>On systems with the <code>org.varlink.resolver</code> interface reachable on a defined varlink URI, the
client can call the <code>method org.varlink.resolver.Resolve(interface: string) -&gt; (address: string)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-varlink-services-accessed-from-a-remote-machine">How are varlink services accessed from a remote machine?</h2>

<p>The varlink command line tool, as well as some varlink language bindings offer the possibility to
connect to a service via a <code>bridge</code>.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Python:
<a href="https://varlink.org/python/#varlink.Client.new_with_bridge">varlink.Client.new_with_bridge()</a></li>
  <li>Rust:
<a href="https://docs.rs/varlink/4.0.0/varlink/struct.Connection.html#method.with_bridge">Connection::with_bridge()</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge command normally is <code>ssh &lt;host&gt; varlink bridge</code>, calling <code>varlink bridge</code> on the
remote host. The <code>varlink bridge</code> command parses all method calls on stdin, queries the
<code>org.varlink.resolver</code> on the remote system for the interface address, connects to this address
and forwards all method calls matching the interface name to the local service on the remote machine.
It reads the replies and passes them back to stdout. Instead of <code>ssh</code> any other connection command
 could be used. Instead of <code>varlink bridge</code> any other utility, which offers an equal
 functionality, could be used.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-version-number-of-an-interface">How can I get the version number of an interface?</h2>

<p>Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a feature set described in detail by
the interface definition, which is part of the wire protocol.</p>

<p>If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only extend it, never remove or
incompatibly change things which might be already in use. Clients can fully introspect a service and
figure out which features the interface supports; this is more expressive than any simple numbering
scheme. If you break the API or remove stuff, just release it with a new name, commonly done by adding
a number to the interface name, like <code>org.example.interface2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-extend-an-interface-in-a-backwards-compatible-way">How do I extend an interface in a backwards compatible way?</h2>

<p>Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in its interface definition or on the
 wire, all parameters are identified by their name and can be extended later.</p>

<p>Things like this are not needed:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
       /* … */
       /*
        * Reserved space to allow possible future extensions without
        * breaking the ABI. You should not touch these, because the
        * names of these variables may change.
        */
       uint32_t reserved_int1;
       uint32_t reserved_int2;
       uint32_t reserved_int3;
       uint32_t reserved_int4;
} my_service_struct_foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields (nullable type, maybe). The result of
the methods, when passed parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected behavior for omitted
fields/parameters should be documented. Removing fields, types, errors or methods are not backward
compatible and should be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-socket-activation-work">How does socket activation work?</h2>

<p>Varlink language bindings commonly implement the systemd socket activation protocol. The environment
of the started service will be augmented with the variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_NAMES, LISTEN_PID.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-implement-exit-on-idle-for-my-service">How do I implement exit-on-idle for my service?</h2>

<p>Services can be started on-demand with socket activation. When there is no background task running and
no clients connected to the service, the service can decide to close the listening socket and exit. A
new connection from a client will activate the service again. Because varlink is strictly
point-to-point, there is no buffering involved and the service activator will queue all incoming
messages, exit-on-idle can be implemented in a race-free manner.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-restrict-the-access-to-my-service">How can I restrict the access to my service?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method is to rely on the permissions of a UNIX socket in the file system.
Services which need a more fine-grained access control can check the connection credentials of a unix
socket and decide per call if they want to act on behalf of the client.
If varlink would be wrapped in GSS-API, e.g. kerberos tickets could be used for more fine grained
access control.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will introduce simple but useful basic widgets and explain the
widgets which we introduced earlier in more detail. All these widgets are really easy
to use. We have constructor functions with names which starts with "new" like
newButton(), we can add these widgets to containers, and connect them directly to
signals or map them to GActions. You should also study the C API documentation of
these simple widgets to learn about all the other functionality that is also
available, like provided functions, available signals or widget properties.  Remember
that GTK widgets build a class hierarchy so functionality may be provided by parent
classes.  For example the GtkCheckButton is a subclass of GtkToggleButton and both
are of course widgets, so you may have to consult all that API documentation to find
functions or properties that you may desire. Also consider using the devhelp tool to
navigate the C API docs. For the more advanced and complicated widgets like
GtkTreeView, GtkListView and GtkDrawingArea we will give only minimal examples in
this chapter to give you a basic feeling what they are and how they can be used.
GtkTreeView and GtkListView are powerfull widgets to display larger textual and other
data sets. And the GtkDrawingArea is a widget where we can draw arbitrary two
dimensional graphics by using drawing functions of the cairo graphics library. We can
use the GtkDrawingArea for pure display purpose, or we can combine it with user input
activities to create advanced CAD tools. One more advanced GTK widget is the
GtkGLArea which can be used to display three-dimensional OpenGL graphics.  But as
creating graphics with OpenGL is a wide area for which many whole books have been
written, we will not try to cover that topic in this book.</p>
<p>The GTK widgets can be grouped into container widgets which arrange other widgets
like GtkBox or GtkGrid, into mostly passive widgets for displaying data like the
GtkLabel, and into the active widgets which accept user input like GtkEntry. For an
overview you may visit the widget gallery page:</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_label">Label</h3>
<p>The GtkLabel is a simple widget that can display some text. The text can have
multiple lines when desired, can wrap automatically and can support style attributes
like italic or boldface. The label widget is mostly used to label other widgets or to
display some textual messages to the user.  GtkButtons use a label widgets to display
its text.  For the actual text display the pango library is used, which supports many
advanced text renderings like right to left text and many attributes like
strike-though, underline, overline (since pango v 1.46) and many more.  GtkLabels
like all GTK widgets support utf8 unicode text which allows display of glyphs of
exotic languages as well as a large range of symbols.</p>
<p>The GtkLabel is one of the simplest GTK widgets and the C API documentation should be
easy to understand and can be used in Nim straight forward:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_properties">Properties</h4>
<p>GTK uses the concept of properties to set or modify the internal state of GTK widgets
or other entities.  For most properties GTK offers setter and getter functions which
we use when available, so we have not to deal with properties that often. But in some
cases it is necessary, so we will introduce the basics at this point already. GTK
properties have textual names like "wrap" or "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and
a typed state like boolean true/false, integer states or states of other types. In C
code most often the function g_object_set() is used to set one or multiple
properties. That function uses multiple untyped arguments. As it is not type safe it
is not provided by gobject-introspection and is not available in most high level GTK
bindings including Nim. Instead we use g_object_set_property() called just
setProperty() to set single properties in Nim.  Unfortunately that procedure needs a
GValue as third parameter which makes it use a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The following example program defines a helper procedure called toBoolVal() to create
a GValue with matching type and content from a Nim bool value. We use the resulting
GValue to set the wrap property of our label and the
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" property of our whole application. Both
properties expects a boolean GValue.</p>

<p>In our toBoolVal() proc we have to create a GType variable first. For this we can use
the typeFromName() proc to which we have to pass the correct GTK type name, or with
recent gintro versions we could use getType() procs like gBooleanGetType() directly.
Guessing the right name is not always easy — for string types we would have to use
gStringGetType() or typeFromName("gchararray"). With that GType we can first init() a
GValue variable and then set its value. GValues are used a lot in gtkListView and
GtkThreeView widgets, we will learn more about GTypes the GValue variables later when
we explain these widgets.  In the above example program we use the function
setProperty() two times. First we set the property
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" for our whole application to true. To do that we
query the default settings with a call of getDefaultSettings() and then set that
boolean value. The result is that our whole app uses a dark color scheme when
available. The second use of setProperty(), again for a boolean variable, is to set
the "wrap" property of one of our label widgets. For this the label class provides
the function setWrap() which we generally would use. We used a GtkBox to arrange our
two labels vertically in our window. We will learn more details about the GtkBox
containers in the next section.</p>
<p>While GtkLabels are most of the time passive entities, they provide some signals like
"activate-link" and "move-cursor".  By default label text can not be copied to the
clipboard, but we can call setSelectable() on a label widget to make it selectable.
Then we can click with the mouse on the text, we can select all or part of the text
and the label widget will get a popup menu which pops up when we press the right
mouse button allowing to select and copy the label text to the clipboard. This can be
useful when a label displays messages which we may want to copy elsewhere.  One of
the many useful functions offered by labels is setEllipsize() which determines how
text not fitting into the available are is handled. That function is often used in
conjunction with setMaxWidhChars() or setWidhChars().  Our second example program
below displays some chess pieces using utf8 unicode glyphs, and an ordinary text
which is displayed in a small font and which is shortened by showing ellipsis when
the enclosing window is small. The label widget with the chess pieces is made
selectable, so you can copy the content into another window, maybe into an instance
of the the gedit text editor.</p>

<p>In both label texts we use html tags like &lt;big&gt; or &lt;small&gt; to modify the text
display. Currently we have to additional call setUseMarkup() on the label to tell it
that html tags should be used. We may expect that for the case that we use
setMarkup() that should be not necessary — maybe it is a bug of early GTK&nbsp;4
release? Modifying the label display with enclosed tags directly is convenient, but
restricted to only a few attributes. In the next section we will lean how we can use
XML UI files to do more advanced text customization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_gtklabels_and_xml_ui_files">GtkLabels and XML UI files</h4>
<p>Earlier in this book we used already XML files to describe the structure of popup
menus.  And we said at the beginning of the book that GTK allows to declare the whole
GUI or parts of it with XML UI files which is then loaded by the GTK builder. Below
you can see such an XML UI file which describes a label and two buttons, which are
arranged into a GtkGrid widget.</p>

    <div><p>A colleague of mine has repeatedly called for some of the controllers in our project to be refactored. He says they're messy, but what I think he means is that they're hard to understand. At first glance they do seem complex yes but upon closer inspection:</p><ul>
<li>There are step-by-step instructions in the comments explaining what's going on.</li>
<li>Variable and method names are descriptive but not overly verbose.</li>
<li>The code is spaced, formatted and indented correctly.</li>
</ul><p>I can see why my colleague might see the code this way; it does have multiple concerns, but it came to be this way iteratively over the course of two years. Everything it does relates to a previously-defined requirement i.e. it does what it's supposed to. We also haven't made any changes to it for several months because it hasn't caused any bugs nor are there any major performance bottlenecks.</p><p>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. You've never heard anyone say the phrase "legacy code" without contempt in their tone. I <i>can</i> appreciate that sometimes old code doesn't conform to newer practices agreed on by a team. For example, legacy PHP code might use the now-deprecated PSR-2 standard, but the tech lead might want everyone to write PSR-12. But is this really a good enough reason to potentially jeopardise a piece of working functionality?</p><p>I think the reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember.

<p>Even when we talk about code, when we're able to recall previous conversations/decisions/motivations quickly, we can talk about it confidently and convey to others that we understand it well.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-ratio-heatmap.png" alt="Compressed bytes divided by original bytes, always less than 30%">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>As you may know, back in 2007 I ressurected the development of <a href="http://grafx2.googlecode.com/">GrafX2</a>.
this old pixelart program, made only for DOS, was left out 6 years earlier by the authors, that had moved on to more modern computers.
Today, graFX2 is amongst the best tool for pixelling, particularly on Linux or other alternative operating systems.
Many people are using it daily to draw really nice pictures. The newer versions added a lot of features such as layers, and there's more to come.</p>

<p>This was possible only because the authors decided to release the source when the project stopped. The code wasn't perfectly clean; it was tied to ms-dos
with some optimized parts written directly in assembly language and accessing the video card hardware directly. Of course, getting an SDL-based version out of it
was not easy. But still, it took considerably less time than rewriting everything from scratch. Also, part of the userbase for the old GrafX2 upgraded to
the new one. For some of them it felt like getting back home after years of using suboptimal tools.</p>

<p>During the revival of GrafX2, I had to develop my web searching skills a lot. First, the original GrafX2 website was offline, and the sourcecode was
gone with it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.filewatcher.com/">filewatcher</a>, an ftpsearch engine, and <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the web archive</a>,
I was able to locate a copy on some russian FTP. Then, I wanted to get in touch with the authors to let them know their software finally found some use.</p>

<p>But grafX2 isn't the main purpose of this article. Last month, I downloaded APlayer, a music player for BeOS. After some hacking to get it working on Haiku
(which eventually led to uncovering and fixing a compatibility bug), I noticed that most musics from Burned Sounds, my preferred chiptune collection, didn't load.
The strange thing is that most of them were in formats supposed to be recognized by APlayer. But looking closer, it turned out they are packed using the Shrink
algorithm. This is a packing system from Amiga days, which can be unpacked only on amiga for lack of any sourcecode or format information. Well, that was until yesterday.
Using my high web searching skills, I found the author of Shrink and kindly asked him by mail if he was willing to release the sourcecode for hissoftware, the last version being from
1996.</p>

<p>He was a bit surprised to see there was some files using Shrink still around, but he had a linux version of the archiver. This version is now released as GPL sourcecode
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ashrink/">sourceforge</a>. This is an important step for me in getting more open source software available ; but also in preserving
old files packed in this format. I hope some other people will find it useful too.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention I also made possible the release of a whole lot of other BeOS software made by Arvid and Jonas Norberg. This include the sawteeth sound synthetizer, as
well as the backslash n demo, and also some other unfinished code.</p>

<p>The overall message is, for developpers : think about opensourcing your old projects. Even if the source is not as clean as it could be ; even if they are of no use for you ;
even if they only work on a dead since 10 years operating system : someone, somewhere, may find it useful. You can visit the <a href="http://www.unmaintained-free-software.org/wiki/Main_Page">
Unamintained Free Software</a> page to get some examples of how passing on a project to someone else may work. But not everything goes through this website.</p>

<p>For non-developpers, don't hesitate to get in touch with the devs, even for unmaintained apps, and ask for an open source release. If the software is dead, the author isn't going to get
anymoney for it, so why not release it so other people can improve it ? This is the fastest way to get more open source software. And don't be shy, developpers are, above all, normal people, and they
do like hearing from users.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20210102/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20210102/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, someone with the handle “entha_saava” posted this question on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23791152">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone knowledgeable explain how are lisp REPLs different from
Python / Ruby REPLs? What is the differentiating point of REPL
driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is that there is a <a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/2020/02/03/programming-as-teaching.html">particular kind of programming</a>
in which you build a program by <em>interacting</em> with it as it runs, and
there are certain languages and runtimes that are designed from the
ground up to support that kind of programming.</p>
<p>Python and Ruby are not examples of such languages.</p>
<p>Why not? That’s the crux of entha_saava’s question, right? What are
these <strong>repl-driven</strong> programming systems, and what makes them
different from Python and Ruby and every other language that offers a
repl?</p>
<p>For that matter, what’s a repl?</p>
<p>The word <strong>repl</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>read-eval-print
loop</strong>. The term comes from the history of Lisp. From the start, sixty
years ago, the standard way of working with a Lisp has been to start a
language processor, type expressions at its prompt, and wait for it to
evaluate the expressions and print their results, before prompting for
another expression. Read, eval, print. Loop.</p>
<p>Nowadays, repls are all the rage. Every language and its brother
offers a repl. There’s a website, <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>, whose
entire purpose is to provide all the repls.</p>
<p>It doesn’t actually provide <em>all</em> the repls, of course. What’s
particularly ironic is that it doesn’t provide either of the canonical
repl-driven development environments: Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>That brings us back to entha_saava’s question: if Common Lisp and
Smalltalk are repl-driven environments, and Python and Ruby are not,
what’s the difference? What do Lisp and Smalltalk have that Python and
Ruby don’t?</p>
<p>What they have is a language and runtime system that are designed from
the ground up with the assumption that you’re going to develop
programs by starting the language engine and talking to it, teaching
it how to be your program <em>interactively</em>, by changing it <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>I can hear the objections formulating already. I’ve seen them
before. Yes, every language with a repl can do some things in the
repl. Obviously that’s true; if it weren’t, then the repl would be
entirely useless.</p>
<p>Being able to do <em>some</em> things in the repl does not make an engine
into a repl-driven programming environment. What distinguishes
old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk environments is that you can do
<em>everything</em> in the repl. They place no gratuitous limitations on what
you can do; if the language and runtime can do it, then the repl can
do it.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask the current version of Clozure Common Lisp to
rebuild itself from scratch by evaluating the following expression at
the repl prompt:</p>
<pre><code>(rebuild-ccl :full t)
</code></pre>
<p>CCL responds by completely rebuilding itself from source.</p>
<p>The point is not that you would want to rebuild CCL this way all the
time. The point is that there are no artificial limitations on what
the repl can do. The full range of the development system’s
capabilities is accessible from the repl.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things I notice when using newer, lesser
repls: I’m always running into things I can’t do from the repl.</p>
<p>It’s not just about freedom from restrictions, though. Proper support
for interactive programming means that the language and its runtime
have positive features that support changing your program <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, <code>foo</code>, that calls some other function, <code>bar</code>, that
is not yet defined. Now call <code>foo</code>. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to <code>foo</code> breaks, because <code>bar</code> is not defined. But
what happens when it breaks? What happens next?</p>
<p>If your favorite repl is Python’s or Ruby’s or any of a few dozen
other modern repls, the answer is most likely that it prints an error
message and returns to its prompt. In some cases, perhaps it crashes.</p>
<p>So what’s my point, right? What else could it do?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the “differentiating point” of
repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk
environment, the break in <code>foo</code> drops you into a <strong>breakloop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakloop</strong> is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the
tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment
of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down
the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically
visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data
in the running program.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can <em>edit</em> all live data in the program. If you think
that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable
or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended
function. If it now works correctly, then congratulations; you found
the problem!</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are
available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing
function <code>bar</code>, resume <code>foo</code>, and get a sensible result.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a style of programming, well known in Lisp and
Smalltalk circles, in which you define a toplevel function with calls
to other functions that don’t yet exist, and then define those
functions as you go in the resulting breakloops. It’s a fast way to
implement a procedure when you already know how it should work.</p>
<p>If you’re a user of old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk systems then this
all sounds obvious to you, but that reaction is not common. Surprise
is much more common, or even suspicion: what’s the catch?</p>
<p>The catch is that the designers of your language system had to think
that facility through in the planning stages. You don’t get a decent
implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need
<em>full</em> access to the <em>entire</em> development system, interactively, with
a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s
environment.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example of a facility designed to support
interactive programming. Once again, try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a datatype. I mean a class, a struct, a record type–whatever
user-defined type your favorite language supports. Make some instances
of it. Write some functions (or methods, or procedures, or whatever)
to operate on them.</p>
<p>Now change the definition of the type. What happens?</p>
<p>Does your language runtime notice that the definition of the type has
changed? Does it realize that the existing instances have a new
definition? When something touches one of them, does it automatically
reinitialize it to conform to the new definition, or, if it doesn’t
know how to do that, does it start a breakloop and ask you what to do
about it?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” then you’re probably using a Lisp or Smalltalk
system. If the answer is “no,” then you’re missing a crucial element
of repl-driven development.</p>
<p>Remember: the point is to support programming <em>interactively</em>. You
don’t want to have to kill your program and rebuild it from scratch
just because you changed a definition. That’s silly; adding and
changing definitions is most of what you do! If your development
environment is going to support interactive development, then it had
better know how to keep your program running when you change some
definitions.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk system know how to do that. There are
also a few other kinds of systems, mostly older ones, that know how to
do it.</p>
<p>These are not eccentric new ideas out of left field. They’ve been
around for half a century. They contribute materially to productivity
in interactive development.</p>
<p>They’re what sets <strong>repl-driven development</strong> apart from mere
development with a repl.</p>
<p>Now, not every programmer prefers that kind of development. Some
programmers prefer to think of development as a process of designing,
planning, making blueprints, and assembling parts on a
workbench. There’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, a
multibillion-dollar international industry has been built upon it.</p>
<p>But if you prefer interactive development, if it’s more natural to
you, then it can make you enormously more productive, not to mention
happier in your work.</p>
<p>Interactive development with a proper repl-driven environment is the
exception. Most programming is done in other ways.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there are a lot of programmers out there who’ve
never even heard of it, who have no idea that it exists. My intuition
is that some fraction of those programmers would prefer well-supported
interactive programming, and would benefit from it, if they just knew
what it was.</p>
<p>Maybe if enough programmers are exposed to that style of programming
then we’ll begin to see new tools that embrace it.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman">Superhuman</h3>

<p>Superhuman is an invite-only $30/month email client.<sup id="fnref:pricing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pricing">1</a></sup> People like it for its sleek design, responsive speed, and suite of keyboard shortcuts to improve a user’s email efficiency. People justify this purchase over free alternatives by the fact that they spend hours on email everyday. Part of Superhuman’s feature offering includes read statuses, which is useful for executives and sales people who like to keep a pulse on their conversations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.growthalytics.com/images/2021-01-02-the-sublime-text-editor-of-x/superhuman.png" alt="Superhuman Product Screenshot"></p>

<p>Users love Superhuman. Take a quick peak on Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitter">2</a></sup> at the effusive praise the company gets. Andreessen Horowitz led the latest investment round in the company with a valuation of roughly $260 million.</p>

<p>Following in the tailwind of this prosumer email client that has taken Silicon Valley and Twitter by storm are a suite of companies claiming to be “Superhuman for x”.<sup id="fnref:superhumanofx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superhumanofx">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As identified by Todd Goldberg, the “Superhuman of X” has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for speed.</li>
  <li>Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.</li>
  <li>Driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  <li>Beautiful and thoughtfully designed.</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Built as a modern alternative to a product that has legacy distribution effects</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Positioned as a premium product vs. free alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I present Sublime Text: a piece of software more than a decade older than Superhuman, that shares the above attributes. Sublime can be driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts. It’s as thoughtfully designed as I have been shamefully unwilling to purchase the non-trial version for 80 USD. The similarities lie much deeper than that. Sublime has two close-to-instant-speed search-bars: one for opening a file in your project [goto] and one for executing commands.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is also simultaneously opinionated but also configurable. It is simple enough for a programmer to install, open, and “hit the ground running” on a big project with a combination of GOTO (⌘+P) and project search (⌘+Shift+F).</p>

<h3 id="the-sublime-text-of-x">The “Sublime Text of X”</h3>

<p>Without futhur ado, I present a case study sampling of “Sublime Texts of X”.</p>

This is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_keying">master key</a>. It is generally accepted that master keyed locks are less secure than non-master keyed locks. If the master password is exposed, then confidence (in all the passwords that it unlocks) is lost.</p><p>And, are we certain that the encryption used to store the passwords is implemented correctly? Has the encryption been externally validated? Some password managers are closed-source and proprietary and cannot be examined.</p><p>Encryption is hard. Even respected, expert developers with many years of experience (who seldom make mistakes) <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html">do make mistakes</a> that render encryption weak or in some cases almost useless.</p><h2 id="reliance-on-remote-systems">Reliance on remote systems</h2><p>Ironically, password managers rely on remote systems largely because they store passwords. The first design flaw causes the second.</p><p>Remote systems are outside the user’s control. They are opaque and cannot be examined and should not be trusted with password management. These systems may not be available when needed. They may not be storing or transmitting passwords correctly.</p><p>Externally, the systems may seem correct (strong HTTPS, reasonable CSP) but behind the scenes, no one really knows what’s going on. How are the passwords being transmitted, generated and stored internally? Who has access to them?</p><p>Several popular cloud-based password managers have reported security breaches: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/onelogin-breach-reignites-concerns-over-password-managers/d/d-id/1329034">1</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/potent-lastpass-exploit-underscores-the-dark-side-of-password-managers/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/">3</a>.</p><h2 id="web-browser-integration">Web browser integration</h2><p>Web browsers today have “everything but the kitchen sink” capabilities built-in and are becoming more and more complex each year. They are turning into whole platforms that have browser plug-ins and extensions for every possible need known to humankind.</p><p>While many of these add-ons are handy and useful, we should not trust them with password management. Browsers are just too complex and have far too much going on.</p><h2 id="dpg">DPG</h2><p>I wrote DPG (The Deterministic Password Generator) around 2010 to address the design flaws described above. Here are its key concepts.</p><ol><li>Never store passwords. Rather, generate them as needed based on user input. The need to backup, synchronize and properly encrypt passwords is removed. There is no master password that immediately unlocks all of the other passwords. There is nothing to become lost, stolen or corrupt.</li><li>Only run locally on end-use devices. No reliance on remote systems or web browsers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG is open-source</a> and has several implementations. The passwords it generates can be verified and validated by external implementations in multiple programming languages.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>DPG removes many of the flaws that I have experienced with traditional password managers over the years. Try it. You may like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/compliance">compliance</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

</details>
<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>
<h3 id="sending-an-incremental-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending an incremental snapshot to a remote server</h3>

<p>These results match closely with the local incremental snapshots.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot">Restoring a snapshot</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh local snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. This is what measuring what happens when you need to do a bulk disaster recovery from your backup repository.</p>

<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot-from-a-remote-server">Restoring a snapshot from a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh remote snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. The main difference from the previous benchmark is the introduction of
an internet connection between the backup repository and restore point.</p>
<p>Network conditions are the same as the fresh network snapshot benchmark.</p>

</details>
<p>Interestingly, the introduction of the network pushed tar ahead of bupstash for backup restoration - this is something I am very interested in investigating further.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup">Pruning an old backup</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer. For this test we generate a backup repository with 50 different snapshots of different versions of the linux kernel source code and then time how long it takes to remove one of the snapshots. This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector is an order of magnitue faster than both restic and borg at pruning the backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup-on-a-remote-server">Pruning an old backup on a remote server</h3>

<p>Once again restic suffers the worst from introduced network latency of all the tools.</p>
<h3 id="approximate-peak-client-side-ram-usage">Approximate peak client side ram usage</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we repeat the fresh snapshot benchmark, but measure the peak client ram usage (RSS) as reported by the ‘time’ command. For tar we approximate this by summing the peak memory usage across tar, gpg and gzip.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>

<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>
