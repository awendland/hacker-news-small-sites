<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident. </strong></p><p>Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising "fabricated and false" accusations, "with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>

<h2>The meeting in Oslo</h2><p>At the same time that Saudi Arabia requested that the security team were registeret as diplomats - in the spring / early summer of 2018 - el-Baghdadi and Khashoggi met in Oslo.

However, Dagbladet knows that PST informed him about the Saudi security team in a meeting.</p><p>- I had a meeting with my contact in PST in January this year. They said Saudi Arabia had applied for an unusually high number of diplomatic visas - which were denied.

<p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly’s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at `arj.python at gmail dot com` to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<p>Dr. Kristian Rother</p>



<p>The perfect introduction for completely new people </p>



<h3><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python 3</a></h3>

<h3> <a href="http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Coder’s Apprentice </a></h3>



<p> Pieter Spronck </p>



<p> “The Coder’s Apprentice” aims at teaching Python 3 to students and teenagers who are completely new to programming. Contrary to many of the other books that teach Python programming, this book assumes no previous knowledge of programming on the part of the students, and contains numerous exercises that allow students to train their programming skills. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://www.brianheinold.net/python/python_book.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Practical Introduction to Python Programming </a></h3>



<p> Brian Heinold </p>



<p> The book aims at striking the balance between a tutorial and reference book. Includes some fun exercises at the end! </p>



<h3> <a href="https://python.swaroopch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Byte of Python </a></h3>



<p>Swaroop C H</p>



<p>“A Byte of Python” is a free book on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this is the book for you. </p>



<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/intermediatepythongithubio/latest/intermediatepythongithubio.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>



<h3><a href="https://leanpub.com/intermediatepython" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBI Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>



<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap. The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code. It aims to&nbsp; provide a reader with not only a …</p></div></div>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the
package look like freshly built.</p><p>In this release, we track the installation in the build graph as well, and we calculate the hash of the installation of dependencies and put it in the
dependent's command line flags for building binary artifacts. Such strategy benefits in such aspects: </p><ul><li><p>The calculation of the hash of installation is almost free since it is just one stat, we don't need track all dependencies' artifacts.</p></li><li><p>The introducion of such hashing does not appear in parsing, so that the changes of dependencies will never trigger re-parsing.</p></li><li><p>Once the package installation is a nop, the transitive rebuild graph will be cut off so that we can save some unneeded rebuild.</p></li><li><p>When people make changes to the depdendencies, if such changes don't change the package interface, it will not trigger the build of its dependents.</p></li></ul><h3>Introducing <code>pinned-dependencies</code><span><span><a href="#introducing-pinned-dependencies"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="introducing-pinned-dependencies"></a></span></span></h3><p>To make <code>bsb -make-world</code> more pratical, we also introduce a new concept called: <code>pinned-dependencies</code>.

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>

<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline. Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/2.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/4.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>While mentioning contributors, I would be remiss to not mention all the wonderful actors who have literally given The Program a voice. A lot of them became frequent collaborators and you can find out more about them not only in the show’s credits available at this website, …</p></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques. Password spraying is a very common technique employed by malicious attackers to compromise systems. In the case of SolarWinds this was even simpler, and weaker credentials may have made the hacker's job just more easier.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-exposed-their-ftp-credentials-in-a-public-github-repository">SolarWinds Exposed their FTP credentials in a public GitHub Repository</h2><p> <strong>Cybersecurity expert, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/">Vinoth Kumar</a> hinted at the fact that the perpetrator may have breached SolarWinds and its clients quite easily – this affects the US government, and top organizations worldwide. Kumar made the following tweet today,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was reading about a sophisticated attack on FireEye leveraging Solarwinds.

<figcaption>Vinoth Kumar's tweet regarding the exposed FTP credentials of SolarWinds</figcaption></figure><p>For the readers who couldn't fully understand the tweet, Vinoth had apparently gotten access to a SolarWinds FTP server on 19th November, 2019 through FTP credentials leaked in a SolarWinds public <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (apparently a<em> configuration</em> file as can be observed from the above email screenshot) which is more than one year ago. He responsibly reported this security incident to the SolarWinds PSIRT team.</p><p>The above tweet includes a screenshot of Vinoth's email communication with the SolarWinds' security team who seem to have acknowledged the issue, but its unclear whether after the incident SolarWinds hardened their server security.</p><h2 id="nation-state-adversary-or-a-simple-github-leak">Nation-State adversary or, a simple Github Leak?</h2><p>Exposing password in public GitHub repositories is a very common security lapse among organizations but can be prevented quite easily with secure practices. We have identified thousands of credentials belonging to companies and responsibly reported such cases. This happened in the case of SolarWinds too, Vinoth found their FTP server credentials which allowed read as well as write access to SolarWinds' FTP server. This critical vulnerability could have allowed them to upload malicious files and binaries to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, which made the SolarWinds Orion software available to its clients for download.</p><p>Vinoth confirmed that the FTP credentials SolarWinds leaked had write access by uploading a test file to the vulnerable FTP server – <a href="https://downloads.solarwinds.com/">downloads.solarwinds.com</a> which apparently hosts very important files, and if tampered with, the results can be disastrous, which was likely the reason of the US Government breach that happened recently. </p><h2 id="solarwinds-might-have-been-compromised-at-least-an-year-ago-in-november-2019">SolarWinds might have been compromised at least an year ago, in November 2019</h2><p>SolarWinds' PSIRT team's last reply to Vinoth was on 22nd November, 2019 which is 3 days after his report, </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the last response I got from them. <a href="https://t.co/Q24JGb3mvr">pic.twitter.com/Q24JGb3mvr</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338449660327854080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>SolarWinds Security Team's response to Vinoth Kumar acknowledging the vulnerability</figcaption></figure><p>They have informed him that the Github repository exposing the credentials was subsequently taken down by SolarWinds. This may have played an important role in the latest security breach of SolarWinds that led to the US Government breach.</p><h2 id="complex-attack-or-a-case-of-weak-credentials">Complex Attack or, a Case of Weak Credentials?</h2><p>Vinoth further mentions in the tweet that the password was <code>*****123</code>. Our <strong>guess</strong> is that, the password of that FTP server was <code>solarwinds123</code>, leaving the redacted part, which is a very weak credential. <code>solarwinds123</code> is an example of the weakest credentials one can think of. &nbsp;Credentials of the FTP download server which was exposed on the SolarWinds GitHub repo are as follows – <code>solarwindsnet:solarwinds123</code></p><p>It would take seconds for advanced credential stuffing tools to exfiltrate into SolarWinds networks leading to the supply chain of the malware used in this attack, which seems to be the case here. Weak and easy to guess credentials continue to be a very common cause of breaches that happens these days. We have observed a lot of big companies using <code>admin:admin</code> and easy to guess credentials in their internal panels, while we performed pentests and bug hunting research. </p><p>This is an ideal example to learn from, what the consequence of weak credentials can be. Organizations should learn from these breaches how easy it is for attackers to compromise an entire organization just by guessing credentials and performing password stuffing attacks.</p><p><em>Although there is more to it that led to the series of events</em>, but the exposed and weak credentials might have played a major role in the SolarWinds hack. The attackers might have been able to gain persistence by obtaining SolarWinds internal credentials and then able to backdoor the SolarWinds Orion (which FireEye called the SUNBURST backdoor, https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp) by uploading it to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, and distributing the same via SolarWinds website to its clients.</p><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-expert-vinoth-kumar">Q&amp;A with Cybersecurity Expert <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">Vinoth Kumar</a></h2><p>We asked cybersecurity expert Vinoth about his opinions on this breach, and how organizations can secure themselves from such sophisticated attacks.</p><p><strong>Q: As you mentioned you found some credentials in the open, do you think the attackers went for a similar approach to use simple OSINT techniques in order to exfiltrate the data?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>I think the attackers must have used the same approach as the FTP server was open &amp; credentials were not strong enough. But it was a sophisticated attack as the binaries were signed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you think organizations can protect themselves from breaches and exposing their credentials?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>Normally most of the companies includes us use the automated scanner for GitHub repos scanning to see any leaked internal credential also security credential scanning should be part of SDLC process.</p><p>Vinoth's social handles and website – <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">vinothsparrow</a> and <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">VinothKumar.me</a></p><h2 id="notable-victims-of-the-solarwinds-breach">Notable Victims of the SolarWinds Breach</h2><p>US Treasury, the US NTIA, and possibly FireEye itself.

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>

<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, of which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>



<hr>



<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>



<p>If you liked this article and want to help me out, there are a few things you can do.</p>

Follow me here: <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaneJonathan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://twitter.com/LeaneJonathan</a></li><li>If you have a spare couple of bucks, please consider joining my Patreon. I’d love to do this as a full time job, but at the moment I’d even settle for breaking even! I’ve just set my Patreon up here:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patreon.com/datamentary" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/datamentary</a></li><li>You could subscribe to my Youtube channel here:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiqE7AFojsc6U7fqmPt2Vdg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiqE7AFojsc6U7fqmPt2Vdg</a><br>Youtube won’t let me monetise until I hit 2000 subscribers, so there’s still a looong way to go&nbsp;</li><li>You could upvote this post on Reddit, share it on FB, etc… Really, any publicity I can get at this point would be a big help.</li><li>And finally, if you have any requests for future topics or would like to collaborate on something, please leave a comment here and I’ll get in touch.</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    <div itemprop="articleBody">

      <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>To make a default Vim installation more useful, type the following 5 lines into its <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hls
set ic
set is
set nu
set noswf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you prefer, copy and paste the spelled out and annotated version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hlsearch    " highlight all search results
set ignorecase  " do case insensitive search 
set incsearch   " show incremental search results as you type
set number      " display line number
set noswapfile  " disable swap file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For what it’s worth, the acronym for the 5 lines is <code>HIINN</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410751" target="_blank">Multiple people on HN</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410742" target="_blank">have pointed out</a> that the 5 lines can be combined into a single line like below. I didn’t know about this capability, but will definitely start doing this from now on:</p>



<p>Also, as mentioned below, this is for temporary environments where you read more than you edit. For your local set up, it’s better to take the time to properly maintain the config file and install plugins as needed.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> is a powerful text editor for Unix/Linux, and I use it frequently to view and edit files. Unfortunately, Vim’s default configurations lack several important usability features compared to popular alternative text editors, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>.</p>

<p>The undesirable defaults are not an issue on my own computer, as I can take the time to configure them. However, often I’d find myself debugging or reading logs on near-fresh Linux installations (eg. virtual machines spun up to do integration testing), where Vim had not yet been configured.</p>

<p>So over time, I distilled the text editor features that I needed the most, and came up with the list above. To set it up, I would run <code>vim ~/.vimrc</code>, manually enter those 5 lines in whichever order that I remembered them, then quit and restart Vim to pick up the new configurations.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The first 4 lines are straightforward - most popular modern text editors already come with all of them out of the box. The last one could be controversial, since <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file" target="_blank">swap file</a> is designed to help users recover work. In practice though, I find it to be more in the way, due to the additional dialogue that pops up when opening a file that has an existing swap file. The recovery feature itself is also not useful to me, as I more often read logs rather than make edits in those cases.</p>

<p>The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, I recommend you to also try putting those 5 lines into the <code>.vimrc</code>. It could make your Vim experience just a bit better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
          
            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>San Francisco was poised to make a big improvement in its central transit system: the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org/index.html"><em>Better Market Street</em></a> plan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_(San_Francisco)">Market Street</a> is one of the major transit arteries of the city, the route that people ride to commute from the Mission and the Haight to downtown.</p><p>It’s also a high-injury corridor, and the city aimed to fix that by creating a grade-separated bike lane and lots of new and improved infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="Better market plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-better-market-plan.png"></p><p>After years of community input and design, the plan was to introduce a separate lane for bikes, sidewalk improvements, separated lanes for buses, and more. It was pretty inspiring.</p><p><img alt="Post-pandemic revised plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-post-pandemic-revised-plan.png"></p><p>But the budget collapse caused by COVID-19 scaled back the project radically, and now we’re considering sharrows instead of separated bicycle lanes. The plan includes what you see above: a double-wide lane where bicyclists perilously “share the road” with taxis, delivery trucks, and city vehicles. It’s what we call <a href="https://bummermarketstreet.com/">Bummer Market Street</a>.</p><p>So I decided to look into the main anti-feature of this plan for cyclists: the sharrow.</p><h2

particular symbol that combines a bicycle icon with an arrow or house icon. Initially, the bicycle was <em>inside</em> the arrow, like it was in a little house, but recently it’s next to the arrow.</p><p>Sharrow symbols are painted on streets or applied with thermoplastic decals.</p><p>The purpose of a sharrow is to <em>encourage good bicyclist and driver behavior</em>. Sharrows don’t increase legal penalties for drivers or cyclists. They encourage cyclists to take the lane, but cyclists are permitted to do that anyway, on any narrow street. Sharrows are supposed to make motorists aware of cyclists. When drivers kill people in sharrows, there aren’t any additional consequences. The consequences for hitting people with cars are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html">minimal</a>.</p><p>Sharrows do constitute <a href="http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/home/showdocument?id=3474">class III bikeways</a>, which bring with them higher penalties for illegal parking.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Denver sharrow" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicajuriga/5066431139">A sharrow in Denver, Colorado / photo by Jess J</a></figcaption><p>James Mackay invented the sharrow in 1993 in Denver, in hopes that it would legitimize bicycles on the road, encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, and reduce wrong-way cycling:</p><blockquote><p>I was hoping the shared lane marking would legitimize the presence of bicyclists, reinforce the correct direction of travel and assign lane position, including the correct approach to an intersection and fill an intermediate niche where typical bike lane markings might not necessarily fit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But I was hoping it overall would provide a step in the right direction towards legitimizing the presence of bicycling and reinforcing bicycle usage. - <a href="https://www.thebicyclestory.com/2016/03/episode-4-a-brief-history-of-the-american-sharrow/">The Bicycle Story: James Mackay</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="what-are-sharrows-supposed-to-do">What are sharrows supposed to do?</h2><p>This is a really important question, because the answer isn’t simply “to protect people.” San Francisco and many other cities have versions of Vision Zero, the idea that traffic deaths should be reduced to zero.</p><p>Sharrows aren’t a general-purpose tool: their applicability and goal is quite specific.</p><p><a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part9/part9c.htm">According to the MUTCD</a>, sharrows may be used to:</p><ol><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in a shared lane with on-street parallel parking in order to reduce the chance of a bicyclist’s impacting the open door of a parked vehicle.</li><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in lanes that are too narrow for a motor vehicle and a bicycle to travel side by side within the same traffic lane.</li><li>Alert road users of the lateral location bicylists are likely to occupy within the traveled way.</li><li>Encourage safe passing of bicyclists by motorists, and</li><li>Reduce the incidence of wrong-way bicycling.</li></ol><p>The purpose of sharrows is thus pretty tied to the problem of <em>dooring</em>, in which drivers don’t look out of their rear-view window before swinging open their doors. Behavioral solutions to dooring, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooring#Dutch_Reach">Dutch Reach</a>, haven’t caught on in America because it’s America.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="A sharrow in Oakland, California" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4920881091">A sharrow in Oakland, California / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><p>The <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Shared-Lane-Markings-When-and-Where-to-Use-Them.pdf">SFMTA</a> proposed additional use-cases for sharrows: Hills, Narrow Streets, Discontinued Bike Lane due to Roadway Narrowing, Discontinued Bike Lane for Right Turn Lane, Lane Drop for Right Turn Only Lane, Double Turn Lanes, Double Turn Lanes with Bike Box, Route Finding, Roundabouts or Traffic Circles, Along Separated Bikeways, and Space for Only One Bike Lane.</p><p>None of this describes the Market Street plan, which would be a double-sharrow in a scenario with no on-street parking.

lanes from car traffic” would improve cycling “a great deal”, more than any other change. Columbus, Ohio asked in 2008 what infrastructure cyclists would want to see, and 85% of respondents referred to bicycle lanes, with only 76% seeing a benefit to shared-use paths.</p><p>Bicycle advocacy organizations also don’t want sharrows: the new Better Market Street plans were <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">immediately panned by the SF Bicycle Coalition</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-inform-drivers-of-the-presence-of-bicyclists">Do sharrows inform drivers of the presence of bicyclists?</h3><p>We have a few sources of data here. Let’s look at the <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/San-Franciscos-Shared-Lane-Pavement-Markings-Improving-Bicycle-Safety.pdf">San Francisco Shared Lane Marking Study</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The majority of the drivers surveyed claimed not to notice the markings. Since the sample size of drivers was so small, the results do not provide conclusive findings. -p13</p></blockquote><p>Do drivers understand the markings?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists that responded, two out of the seven that noticed the markings understood that the marking indicate that they should allow more room for cyclists. p14</p></blockquote><p>There’s a study from Brookline, MA. Do drivers notice markings there?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists surveyed, only 21% noticed the markings and were at least 70% confident that the markings indicated a preferred zone for bicycling.</p></blockquote><p>Casual observations from Warren Vermont:</p><blockquote><p>Casual verbal survey of approximately 200 local citizens and 50 bicyclists led to conclusion that bicyclists felt the symbols were too small to be effective and local drivers rarely noticed them. The Vermont DOT decided to not encourage their use, to not replace them, and to not include them in future plans</p></blockquote><p>Do cyclists understand the symbols? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp1gN8xsz3o">Here’s a news report about how they don’t</a>. The city of Fremont had to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qg6cpG7Zeg">publish a video about how to use sharrows</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-make-streets-safer">Do sharrows make streets safer?</h3><p>A striking commonality in the sharrow research is that safety is not clearly measured. Proxies to safety are measured: cyclists riding in the center of the lane, in the right direction, not on sidewalks, and sometimes the distance from cars to bikes. The Texas study does an impressive amount of statistical reasoning about passing events &amp; horizontal positioning on the street. But actual safety is not rigorously measured.</p><p>The one study that directly studies the effectiveness of bicycle sharrows <em>for safety</em> is called <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1393928"><em>The Relative (In)Effectiveness of Bicycle Sharrows on Safety Outcomes</em></a>. It’s a quick read, but the killer line is:</p><blockquote><p>Results suggest that not only are sharrows not as safe as bike lanes, but they could be more dangerous than doing nothing at all.</p></blockquote><p>This probably isn’t the question you care about, right? Proper horizontal positioning isn’t one of the <a href="https://www.visionzerosf.org/">Vision Zero SF</a> goals. Bicyclists don’t talk that much about proper horizontal positioning.</p><p>But nevertheless: proper horizontal positioning is one of the key goals of sharrows. Three of the five goals outlined in the MUTCD are different kinds of proper horizontal positioning. The first goal of San Francisco’s study was horizontal positioning. Most of the sharrow-related data collected is about horizontal positioning.</p><p>As Ferenchak &amp; Marshall note, there is mixed evidence for horizontal positioning in correctly-painted sharrows.</p><p>Amusingly, though, there are a lot of sharrows that don’t even encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, because they’re painted in the “door zone”: exactly the area that cyclists are supposed to stay away from.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Door-zone sharrow in Chicago" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/38067633996">A sharrow in Chicago that has been painted exactly in the 'door zone' which sharrows are supposed to keep bicycles out of / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><h2 id="why-dont-sharrows-go-away">Why don’t sharrows go away?</h2><p>I’m not the first to point out the uselessness of sharrows. The In(effectiveness) study by Ferenchak and Marshall got airtime on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/14/study-sharrows-dont-make-streets-safer-for-cycling/">Streetsblog</a> and <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/">99 Percent Invisible</a>. The bicycle coalition immediately <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">opposed San Francisco’s new sharrows</a>.

Sure, you have it now, but it’s not going to do anything.</p><h2 id="how-sharrows-snuck-into-transportation-planning">How sharrows snuck into transportation planning</h2><p>Sharrows started as a brutal compromise. The creator of the sharrow, James Mackay, essentially said that it was a bare-minimum way to do <em>something</em> for cycling in a city that didn’t want to do anything:</p><blockquote><p>Part of it was the city of Denver’s reluctance to do much of anything for bicycles. So I figured, this would be a less expensive approach versus the conventional bike lane markings. A lot of the agencies don’t want to do anything involving change or spending money for bicycles. I was always under pressure to do less as the Denver bicycle planner.</p></blockquote><p>In this form, as a temporary measure in the evolution of cities away from cars, sharrows made sense.</p><p>And sharrows <em>are</em> successful, to some degree, at encouraging cyclists to avoid the “door zone.” And those small, measurable improvements in ‘horizontal positioning’ bought the sharrow’s way into transit device standards.</p><p>Then cities started pushed sharrows in all sorts of scenarios that needed bike lanes, not a temporary, toothless symbol on the asphalt. And since they’re cheap and don’t disrupt car traffic, they caught on.</p><p>But sharrows have overreached and underperformed. Any …</p></div></div>

    <section>
        <p><img src="https://aberba.com/images/2020-why-use-d.png" alt="No one"></p>

<p>There are so many programming language but only a few really appeal to the
majority of developers, hence their popularity (most used) and community size
explosion. Popular languages have more hands on deck hence their
<a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/accumulative-advantage/">Accumulative Advantage</a>:
more developers -&gt; more ideas -&gt; more contributions -&gt; more tools -&gt; more
third-party packages -&gt; more corporate support (because most of these developers
work for companies) -&gt; more apps -&gt; repeat. This very advantage gives birth to
many more advancement to the language and it’s ecosystem. As more and more
people build their businesses and tools around the language, they are
incentivize to continuously invest their engineering resources and money to
improve the overall ecosystem. Think about it 🤔</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s my point in relation to D?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> is a unique but still familiar language. It has almost
all the attributes suited for a mainstream programming languages. It’s
statically typed but still manages to be fluid and easy to write code in like
any dynamically typed language. It’s got all the powerful features I’ve seen in
any other language out there, either comparably similar or better. Moreover,
it’s got some of the most brilliant people behind it. This is why I’ve gone as
far to write several articles about why D is great for development including
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development">this one on OpenSource.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why isn’t D mainstream?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So first of all you may ask, why is it even necessary to be mainstream or
“popular”? Isn’t staying small and nimble how we can attract quality over
quantity?</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment to an extent but the cost definitely outweighs the
benefit. When a larger community is well managed with clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals, they can accomplish more. <strong>Clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals</strong> ahh? Yep. That’s one of the key missing
ingredients of the D community even as small and nimble as it is. Despite the
clever language design and seemingly promising direction, D lacks in the soft
side. This is what I believe holds the grow and adoption of the language back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft skills… the people and organizational things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a-train-with-no-destination">A train with no destination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The roadmap of the D language is still very unclear and the project page on
GitHub has not been updated for over a year. See
https://github.com/dlang/dmd/projects</li>
  <li>There’s little to no communication of language objects and mobilization of
the community to reach certain milestones. There’s almost no organizational
side to the
<a href="https://dlang.org/foundation/about.html">D Language Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why do I still use D?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>D is technically the best out there for me. It’s the only modern system
programming language with a clean and familiar syntax.</li>
  <li>It’s very powerful and capable of solving any domain problem: web
development, network applications, system development, scripting, gaming,
etc. This is rare because almost every language out there is either suited
for one thing or the other.</li>
  <li>It’s got a package system. Unless you’ve got infinite amount of time on a
project, you’ll need to use code others have written to solve similar
problems you may have. D makes it easy to discover such packages from
<a href="https://code.dlang.org/">it’s package repository</a>. Almost all modern
language have similar centralized package repositories.</li>
  <li>A great community. D has got one of the best communities I’ve ever seen. The
community is very welcoming and helpful. The only thing we lack now is
mobilization and direction.</li>
  <li>It keeps getting better. D has consistently improved over the years that
I’ve been in the community. Yes, it moves at a slow pace but it doesn’t
invalidate the fact that things keep getting better.</li>
  <li>It can be better. Comparatively, D heavily lacks in community organization,
leadership communication, development tools, third-party packages,
user-friendly documentation, learning resources, onboarding experience and
general ecosystem polish. These can make D unappealing for certain projects
with the need for a matured ecosystem. However, this can be made better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this year comes to an end, I hope the D Language Foundation and community
revisit past mistakes and look for way to make things better. I am here to stay.</p>

<h2 id="1-overview"><a href="#1-overview" aria-label="1 overview permalink"></a>1: Overview</h2>
<p>First we need to ask what is graphql? There are a couple of answers</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A type system - type definitions define how data should look. They are written to show what is included and highlight the relationships (how things relate). This system definition language can be transformed into AST.</li>
<li>A formal language for querying data - what to fetch from where.</li>
<li>Rules for validating or executing a query against the Schema.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point (3) above references the official <b>Specification</b> which defines the rules for types, validation and executing the schema. It can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spec.graphql.org/">spec.graphql.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a documentation-friendly website <a href="https://graphql.org/learn">graphql.org/learn</a></p>
<p>All languages follow the spec, and the JS <code>graphql</code> library frequently references part of it. We will be looking at that library as part of this section.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-schema"><a href="#building-the-schema" aria-label="building the schema permalink"></a>Building the schema</h3>
<p>Building the schema is important part for a graphql application, as mentioned above it defines all types and their relationships. There are 2 steps to this</p>
<h4 id="1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast"><a href="#1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast" aria-label="1 parses schema notation usually found in a schemagraphql file into ast permalink"></a>1. Parses "schema notation" (usually found in a <code>schema.graphql</code> file) into AST</h4>
<p>The parser will throw errors if it is not a GraphQL schema. See snippet from <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/schema.js#L52">types/schema.js</a> (below)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>isSchema</span><span>(</span><span>schema</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>instanceOf</span><span>(</span>schema<span>,</span> GraphQLSchema<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances"><a href="#2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances" aria-label="2 transform ast into objects and instances permalink"></a>2. Transform AST into objects and instances</h4>
<p>We need a schema which is a type instance of <code>GraphQLSchema</code> (see above snippet). We then need objects inside the schema which match types, for example a scalar or an object.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/definition.js#L575">Example of a scalar</a> (below snippet)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> OddType <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLScalarType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>"Odd"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>value <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> value
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The native scalar types defined for GraphQL are <code>ID</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Boolean</code>. You can define your own inside your type system.</p>
<h4 id="summarise"><a href="#summarise" aria-label="summarise permalink"></a>Summarise</h4>
<p>Essentially for building the schema we turn this graphql schema notation:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Book <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>!</span>
  title<span>:</span> String
  authors<span>:</span> <span>[</span>Author<span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this Javascript</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> Book <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLObjectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Book'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLNonNull</span><span>(</span>GraphQLID<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    title<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLString</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    author<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLList</span><span>(</span>Author<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Almost all of the GraphQL types that you define will be object types. Object types have a name, but most importantly describe their fields.</p>
<p>A <code>GraphQLSchema</code> looks like the below in raw POJO form:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>GraphQLSchema {
  astNode: {
    kind: 'SchemaDefinition',
    ...
  },
  extensionASTNodes: [],
  _queryType: Query,
   ...
  _typeMap: {
    Query: Query,
    ID: ID,
    User: User,
    String: String,
    ...
  },
  ...
}</code></pre></div>
<p>It holds AST information too but the root Query and types are found under the <code>_typeMap</code> property.</p>
<h4 id="adding-resolvers"><a href="#adding-resolvers" aria-label="adding resolvers permalink"></a>Adding resolvers</h4>
<p>Resolvers cannot be included in the GraphQL schema language, so they must be added separately.</p>
<p>They are added to the <code>_typeMap</code> property, under <code>_typeMap.&lt;Type&gt;._fields.&lt;field&gt;</code>
So after adding the resolvers, a schema object might look like below:</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code> _typeMap<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   Query<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> users<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
   User<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> address<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the HTTP request side the community has largely standardized on a HTTP POST method. But what happens when the server receives a query?</p>
<h3 id="query-lifecycle"><a href="#query-lifecycle" aria-label="query lifecycle permalink"></a>Query lifecycle</h3>
<p>The GraphQL spec outlines what is known as the "request lifecycle". This details what happens when a request reaches the server to produce the result.</p>
<p>There are 3 steps that occur once the lifecycle is triggered.</p>
<h4 id="1-parse-query"><a href="#1-parse-query" aria-label="1 parse query permalink"></a>1. Parse Query</h4>
<p>Here the server turns the query into AST. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lexical Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's Lexer identifies the pieces (words/tokens) of the GraphQL query and assigns meaning to each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntactic Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's parser than checks whether the pieces conforms to the language syntax (grammar rules)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If both these pass the server can move on.</p>
<p>In <code>graphql-js</code> this is all found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/language/parser.js#L137">parser.js</a> file and function.</p>
<p>This query:</p>
<p><code>query homepage { posts { title author } }</code></p>
<p>Becomes the AST</p>

<p>You can see this for yourself on <a href="https://astexplorer.net/">astexplorer</a> under GraphQL.</p>
<h4 id="2-validate-query"><a href="#2-validate-query" aria-label="2 validate query permalink"></a>2. Validate Query</h4>
<p>This step ensures the request is executable against the provided Schema. Found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/validation/validate.js#L36">validate.js</a> in the <code>graphql-js</code> library.</p>
<p>While it is usally run just before execute, it can be useful to run in isolation. For example by a client before sending the query to the server. The benefit is that the validator could flag an invalid query before it is sent to the server, saving a HTTP request.</p>
<p>It works by <em>checking each field in the query AST document against its corresponding type definition in the schema object</em>. It will compare argument type compatibility as well as coercion checks.</p>
<h4 id="3-execute-query"><a href="#3-execute-query" aria-label="3 execute query permalink"></a>3. Execute Query</h4>
<p>This step is by far the most intensive and the step I often found the most confusing in its mechanism. We will be digging deeper into this step in part 2, so lets look at the process involved from a high-level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the operations i.e. a query or mutation? (several queries can be made at once)</li>
<li>Then resolve each operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For step (2) each query/mutation is run in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="resolving-each-operation"><a href="#resolving-each-operation" aria-label="resolving each operation permalink"></a>Resolving each operation</h5>
<p>For step 2 GraphQL iterates over each field in the selection-set, if it is a scalar type resolve the field (<code>executeField</code>) else recurse the selection-sets until it resolves to a scalar.</p>
<p>The way this works is that the engine calls all fields on the root level at once and waits for all to return (this includes any promises). Then after reading the return type it cascades down the tree calling all sub-field resolvers with data from the parent resolver. Then it repeats this cascade on those field return types. So simply speaking it calls the top-level Query initially and then the root resolver for each type.</p>
<p>The mechanism caled "scalar coercion" comes into play here. Any values returned by the resolver are converted (based on the return type) in order to uphold the API contract. For example a resolver returning string "123" with a number type attached to it will return <code>Number("123")</code> (i.e a number).</p>
<p>This is found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/execution/execute.js#L103">execute.js</a> file and function inside <code>graphql-js</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly the result is returned.</p>
<h3 id="introspection-system"><a href="#introspection-system" aria-label="introspection system permalink"></a>Introspection system</h3>
<p>Its worth mentioning the introspection system. This is a mechanism used by the GraphQL API schema to allow clients to learn what types and operations are supported and in what format.</p>
<p>The clients can query the <code>__schema</code> field in the GraphQL API, which is always available on the root type of a Query.
Any interactive GraphQL UIs rely on sending an <code>IntrospectionQuery</code> request to the server, which builds documentation and auto-completion with it.</p>
<h3 id="libraries"><a href="#libraries" aria-label="libraries permalink"></a>Libraries</h3>
<p>As part of my research I covered many different libraries, so I thought it was worth giving a quick overview of the main ones in the JS ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="graphql-js"><a href="#graphql-js" aria-label="graphql js permalink"></a><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">graphql-js</a></h4>
<p>The reference implementation of the GraphQL spec, but also full of useful tools for building GraphQL servers, clients and tooling.

<ul>
<li>Take output of introspection query and builds the schema out of it</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="graphql-tools"><a href="#graphql-tools" aria-label="graphql tools permalink"></a><a href="https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools">graphql-tools</a></h4>
<p>It's an abstraction on top of <code>graphql-js</code>. Houses lots of functionality including generating a fully spec-supported schema and stitching multiple schemas together.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at instruction fetch, decode and dispatch in the Cortex-A72 micro-architecture. These are the “front-end” stages of the core pipeline. The “back-end” of the pipeline consists of the register file(s), execution units and retirement (reorder) buffer. Branch prediction is frequently associated with the front-end since it directly affects instruction fetch.</p>



<p>The front-end has one major job: Fetch ARMv8 instructions and keep the back-end execution units as busy as possible.</p>



<p>This page is required reading for <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/raspberry-pi-4-mini-review/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> (BCM2711, ARM Cortex-A72) programmers who want to tune their programs for the <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/raspberry-pi-4-arm-cortex-a72-processor/">ARM Cortex-A72</a>. It is also necessary background information for programmers doing performance measurement with <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/performance-events-on-raspberry-pi-4-tips/">PERF (Performance Events for Linux) on Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>



<h2>Fetch, decode and dispatch </h2>



<p>The Cortex-A72 pipeline has 15 stages. [On-line sources disagree on the length; some sources claim 14 stages.] The front-end stages are:</p>



<ul><li>Fetch (5 stages) </li><li>Decode (3 stages) </li><li>Rename (1 stage) </li><li>Dispatch (2 stages) </li></ul>



<p>The back-end pipeline stages are:</p>



<ul><li>Execute (1 to 6 stages depending upon unit) </li><li>Write-back/retirement (2 stages) </li></ul>



<p>Each execution unit has its own pipe:</p>



<ul><li>Integer 0 (1 stage/cycle) </li><li>Integer 1 (1 stage/cycle) </li><li>Integer multi-cycle (4 to 12 cycles) </li><li>FP/ASIMD 0 (6 to 18 cycles) </li><li>FP/ASIMD 1 (6 to 32 cycles) </li><li>Load L1D cache hit: 4 cycles) </li><li>Store (1 cycle) </li><li>Branch (1 cycle) </li></ul>



<p>See the ARM Cortex-A72 software optimization guide for exact instruction execution latencies.</p>

<p>70 plus years after von Neumann, we still adhere to a linear, sequential program model. In the programmer’s view, there is a program counter (PC) which steps through instructions sequentially, even if some of the intended high-level computations could be performed in parallel by the execution units. Further, we force compilers to lay down instructions in the same linear, sequential fashion.</p>



<p>The front-end’s job is to find instruction-level parallelism (ILP) within the incoming instruction stream. The Cortex-A72 front-end translates ARMv8 instructions into micro-ops. It sends the micro-ops to the back-end functional units for execution and architecture-level retirement. </p>



<blockquote><p>
This all may seem inefficient and crazy and it is. Program representation and execution need a major re-think along the lines of the once-investigated dataflow architecture. Why do and then un-do?
</p></blockquote>



<p>Front-end translation is really two steps: translating ARMv8 instruction into macro-ops and then translating macro-ops into micro-ops. Let’s examine the details.</p>



<p>First, fetch acquires a 16-byte (128 bit quadword) fetch window and it recognizes ARMv8 instructions within the window (and across windows). Then, the decode stages turn the ARMv8 instructions into one or more macro-ops. The decoder will fuse multiple ARMv8 instructions into a single macro-op if such an optimization is possible. Architectural registers are renamed to an internal register file which temporarily holds intermediate results. Next, the macro-ops are translated into micro-ops and the micro-ops are dispatched to the issue queue belonging to the appropriate functional unit. Micro-ops are dispatched into 8 independent issue queues (one queue per execution pipeline). When an instruction successfully completes, it is retired and its result is committed to the architectural machine state. [I will discuss the meaning of “successfully completes” in a minute.]  </p>



<p>There are limits on the number of ARMv8 instructions, macro-ops and micro-ops which are processed during a machine cycle:</p>



<pre>    3 ARMv8 instructions --&gt; 3 macro-ops --&gt; 5 micro-ops <br>           Decode              Rename          Dispatch </pre>



<p>During each cycle, the Cortex-A72 can decode 3 ARMv8 instructions, produce up to 3 macro-ops and dispatch up to 5 micro-ops. There are additional limitations on the number of micro-ops of each type that can be simultaneously dispatched (quoting the Cortex-A72 software optimization guide):</p>



<ul><li>One micro-op using the Branch pipeline </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Integer pipelines </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Multi-cycle pipeline </li><li>One micro-op using the F0 pipeline </li><li>One micro-op using the F1 pipeline </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Load or Store pipeline </li></ul>



<p>If there are more micro-ops to be dispatched above these limitations, they are dispatched in oldest-to-youngest age order.</p>



<p>According to ARM, most ARMv8 instructions are converted to a single micro-op (average: 1.08 micro-ops per instruction).</p>



<p>Register renaming allows micro-ops to execute out-of-order. Remember, we forced the compiler to lay down ARMv8 instructions in-order. Register renaming allows the micro-ops to execute out-of-order without violating data dependencies between architectural registers. There are 128 physical rename registers.</p>



<h2>Speculative execution</h2>



<p>Now the really tricky stuff — speculative execution. A basic block is a sequence of “straight-line” code with a single branch instruction at the end of the block. Program control flows into a basic block and is redirected at the end to either the same basic block or perhaps a different basic block. </p>



<p>Generally, basic blocks are about 9 instructions long. The branch at the end may be a conditional branch. The combination of short block length and conditional branching limits the number of ARMv8 instructions which can be aggressively fetched, decoded and dispatched within a single basic block. Without speculative execution, the processor must wait every time a conditional branch needs to be decided.</p>



<p>Enter branch prediction. When Cortex-A72 hits a conditional branch, it predicts the direction: taken or not taken. [More about branch prediction in a minute.] The front-end continues to fetch, decode and dispatch along the predicted control flow path. If the prediction is correct, hurray! The predictor has guessed correctly and the execution units have already been computing useful results. As each ARMv8 instruction completes along a known-to-be correct path, the instructions along the path retire in architectural order. This is the meaning of “successfully completes” above.</p>



<p>If a conditional branch is not predicted correctly (a “mispredict”), the intermediate results along the wrong path are discarded and the fetch stage is told to start fetching from the correct target address. This is called a “re-steer” as in the phrase “re-steering the front-end.” Recovery from a branch mispredict requires a pipeline flush and, yes, it’s expensive — at least 15 cycles.</p>



<p>The Write-back/retirement stage keeps track of the “retire pointer,” that is, the architectural program counter. The retirement stage is some of the most difficult hardware logic to design and it <strong>must be correct</strong>. The retirement stage maintains a reorder buffer which keeps the books on instruction and micro-op status. The reorder buffer has 128 entries, allowing up to 128 ARMv8 instructions to be simultaneously in flight.</p>



<h2>Branch prediction</h2>



<p>High performance rides on branch prediction accuracy. If the predictor guesses correctly most of the time, then speculative execution is a win. If the predictor guesses incorrectly, the core must throw away useless results and the execution pipeline stalls.</p>



<p>A deep dive into branch prediction is beyond the scope of this note. So, here’s a sketch. The predictor maintains a Pattern History Table (PHT) which retains the taken or not-taken status of (recent) branches encountered by the core. The predictor also maintains a Branch Target Buffer (BTB) containing the target addresses of these branches. The predictor uses the pattern history to predict the direction of a branch when it encounters the branch again. The BTB supplies the associated target address.</p>



<p>Cortex-A72 allows split BTB entries, accomodating both near branches (small target address) and far branches (large target addresses). That’s why you will see the BTB capacity quoted as 2K to 4K entries. The A72 BTB can hold as a many as 2K large target address (far) and 4K small target addresses (near). The A72 also has a micro-BTB which acts as a cache memory for the main BTB. The micro-BTB has 64 entries.</p>



<p>The branch prediction window is 16 bytes, which has implications for basic block layout. According to the Cortex-A72 software optimization guide, branch targets should be quadword aligned (i.e., 16 byte boundaries) and not more than two taken branches should be included with the same quadword-aligned quadword of instruction memory.</p>



<p>The compiler should really take care of quadword alignment and packing for you. As a higher-level language programmer, you can improve branch prediction by biasing flow conditions toward a true program path or the respective false program path. If a given path (true if-clause or false if-clause) is more frequently executed, the branch predictor should do a better job predicting the underlying conditional branch generated by the compiler.</p>



<p>Cortex-A72 has predictors for subroutine return and indirect branch. The predictor maintains an 8 [?] entry Call/Return Stack which remembers the most recent return addresses. Measurement shows that 8 entries (or so) are enough for most high-level language workloads, covering the most recently called functions.</p>



<h2>Bi-mode prediction</h2>



<p>There are three sources of interference in a Pattern History Table (PHT):<br>     * Cold miss (compulsory alias)<br>     * PHT capacity miss (capacity alias)<br>     * Conflict miss (conflict alias)<br> Conflict misses can be reduced by partitioning the PHT or using a different<br> indexing scheme.</p>



<p>The ARM Cortex-A15 Bi-Mode predictor uses two pattern history tables and a choice predictor to reduce negative interference of branches in different <br> program modes. Instead of one big PHT, the pattern history is partitioned<br> into two halves, i.e., two smaller PHTs. A choice predictor table selects<br> one of the two PHTs. The chosen side delivers the final prediction.</p>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>I get asked a lot about learning languages, so I have a few comments about it here.
Hopefully I can awaken you from some dogmatic slumbers about language.</p>

<h2>Vocabulary is the least important part of learning a language.</h2>

<p>
This is hard for people to understand because I think most monolingual people think that languages are just different word lists that people use.
As a result, 101 students will manually look up every word in the dictionary to translate.
This actually increases the mental load of learning a language because people have the idea that to speak it, they have to think of something in English, then translate the sentence word by word, then say that.
What a pain.
</p>

<p>
So what is a language if not words?
It really is a set of constraints as to how words can go together: what order they go in when modifying each other,
but also languages are morphology.
Verb endings and tenses and such are literally the most important part of a sentence.
If you don't have a productive and reflexive use of verbs, you are literally just going to be reciting nouns you know like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
This is actually why I recommend people learning Romance languages or German to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/michel-thomas.html">use Michel Thomas's audio</a>.
Thomas doesn't lecture at all about what he's doing, but he focused only on using verbs and building up basic expressions from the bottom up until it's understood reflexively by students.
To actually learn any language, this is more or less what you are going to have to mentally do anyway in the process.
</p>

<p>
<strong>I would say it's actually possible to fluently speak a language knowing only about 50 words.</strong>
If you understand the "grammar" of a language, you can basically get by anywhere anytime with a couple dozen words only.
What words you don't know can easily be figured out, but you <em>can't</em> wing it with grammar and you <em>can't</em> wing it with morphology.
</p>

<h3>Computer metaphor</h3>

<p>
Granted, the same is true of programming "languages" as well, weirdly enough.
No one would think "knowing a [computing] language" means just knowing all the function and variable names.
The important thing is knowing the syntax of how you put functions (loosely verbs) and variables (loosely nouns) together.
After all, variable names are always different and functions can be easily invented too or called from some obscure library.
Someone who knows a language is someone who can use its syntax to produce novel expressions.
If you take a Python script, replace its functions with C functions, it's still Python, just calling a bunch of undefined functions.
People can only get away with even sort of believing this in the domain of human languages if you just don't know enough and end up assuming that all languages just work the same.
</p>

<h2>Then what is a language?</h2>

<p>
So really when you learn a language, you can't look at it as new words, but new patterns of speech that interconnect in a logical way.
</p>

<p>
Speaking fluently in that language means being able to use and combine its basic constructions into complex thoughts put in words.
This is why I'm really against "translating in your head."
If you're doing that, you're not actually using the language.
You're teaching yourself a silly English-word-replacement game.
I know it's very hard for word-thinkers not to think in words, but if you can't stop doing that for a second, you're not going to be able to learn a new language.
</p>

<h2>You will not learn a language by consoooming media.</h2>

<p>There's this lazy idea that somehow if you passively sit around and watch people using a language this will somehow endow you with the ability to flexibly produce a language in the same way you see others using it.
People want to believe it because they want to be able to watch TV or play a cell phone game like Duolinguo or valueless Rosetta Stone-like software and somehow gain competence in a language.
</p>

<p>
It's not going to happen ever.
<strong>Learning to play a boring computer game using words from a different languages is not the same as learning to speak the language.</strong>
</p>

<p>
You might say of "just listening to speech" that "that's what children do," but that's not true at all.
Children try pretty hard to participate and understand conversation.
They sometimes have a desperate personal need to understand each passing sentence and hear the language they are trying to learn for hours a day for years.
You watching some forgettable movie in the background as you play with your phone don't.
</p>

<h2>Are you actually thinking?</h2>

<p>If you want to know if you are actually learning a language, ask yourself that.
People are weirdly afraid against actually thinking through things and making new expressions in other languages when that's exactly how you learn them.
</p>

<p>A lot of language nerds love to email me about their Anki cards or their harebrained schemes for mass-memorizing words as if they're an Asian studying for a chemistry test.
Given what I've said about "learning words," you can guess my opinion on that.
Once people abandon the lazy route, sometimes they take up the <i>via dolorosa</i>: the route of suffering and assume that training themselves like a Pavlovian dog will help them become fluent in a language.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the only question that matter is: "Are you actually thinking?"
Are you actually going through the mental process of creating new sentences in a new language?
</p>

<p>
When I was learning Latin obviously I had no Latin-speaking friends and could barely get my hands on anything Latin-related.
But after I learned the basics of the language I started thinking in it constantly.
First that starts in my always implicitly translating English song lyrics or ads in my head into Latin.
That's actually difficult if you're dealing with something modern and idiomatic.
Not as bad with church songs.
As time goes on, I would overtly remember things in Latin sentences instead of English.
If I mumbled something under my breath I would make sure it was Latin.
At all points in time, I was thinking about how the language was structured and what it meant to produce sentences in it.
</p>

<p>
The sad fact is that most people who "learn" languages in school treat them as advanced cross-word puzzle like games where they don't <em>actually think</em> in the language, but have hilarious mnemonic devices in their head for relating what they want to say in English with something in the language they're learning.
</p>

<h2>Translating is a bad habit.</h2>

<p>
If anything, you should become <em>worse</em> at translating the further you go on and the more independently you can stand on your own in another language.
</p>

<p>
Latin is a good example.
I can read and comprehend Latin very well, but if asked to translate what I'm reading, I find that more and more difficult the better I read Latin.
Now it's easy for me to report the meaning of a passage, but phrase-by-phrase translation is something you have to think through because Latin and English are structurally very different.
This isn't just word order, but even how a Latin speaker approaches expressions and the kinds of phrases they use can translate only very delicately into English.
</p>

<p>
The problem nearly doesn't exist between English and Spanish, which are basically the same language.
I'm sure someone who only knows Spanish will feel like English and Spanish have many differences, but in the context of other languages, like Latin or Chinese or Japanese, it's hard not to view English and Spanish as having basically the same kind of syntax 95% of the time.
That actually goes for most modern European languages.
</p>

<h2>You sound stupid if you don't sound stupid.</h2>

<p>
Every language has its own set of phonological rules that determine what particular sounds are said how and where.
Phonological rules give us "our accents."
When someone speaks English in an accent, they are really just speaking English using the phonological constraints of whatever language they're more familiar with.
If they speak English competently, there's at least some extent to which they are abandoning their native phonological rules.
</p>

<p>
When you first start learning a language, you might read something aloud and say "I sound stupid."
This is because your natural way of speaking is obviously to say everything with an accent consistent with English.
You can probably remember the apathetic jock in Spanish class or whatever who religiously pronounced every Spanish word he mindlessly read with an almost intentionally non-Spanish accent.
</p>

<p>
To actually speak another language is to adopt the phonological tendencies and even the prosodic and tonal traits of that language.
When you initially do that, you will probably sound very stupid to yourself since violating phonological rules you're familiar with always sounds wrong.
If you do overcome that illusion of felt stupidity, you <em>won't</em> sound stupid when it counts.
If you refuse to improve your accent <em>immediately and from the beginning</em> you will sound like an utter moron forever.
</p>

<p>
There's actually a trick too: when you imitate a foreign accent, you are actually implicitly adopting the phonological rules of their language that you have noticed in real life.
My suggestion is when you are starting out, <em>read the other language in what you'd guess would be a stereotypical accent of the person speaking the language</em>.
If your imitation is good, you're speaking their language without an accent.
</p>

<h2>"The Critical Period" is fake.</h2>

<p>
That reminds me.
</p>

<p>
There's an idea in academic and clinical linguistics as well as popular culture that children have a magical plasticy of the brain that makes them uniquely good at learning languages.
This is supposed to be the reason why children learn languages "fast" and adults don't.
<strong>I think this is a myth.</strong>
You don't have to send me all the "proof" about this (don't worry, the Universities of Georgia and Arizona would've failed me totally if I hadn't seen it for my linguistics degrees there).
I sort of assumed that this was true for years, but on further thought, I think it's just a conspiracy of irrelevant data and copes...
or at least, it's not nearly as …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy announced its intention to offer $400M of debt to investors, and a plan to purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds.</p><p>This was the 4th time MicroStrategy announced plans to buy Bitcoin, but for the first time, the market had a strong negative reaction to MicroStrategy's announcement.</p><p>On December 8th, Microstrategy's stock was down by 14%, their largest single-day decline since March 18th.</p><p>Why the negative reaction? Because this time the Bitcoin would be bought with other people's money, instead of the cash reserves already on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.</p><p>Despite the negative reaction, this bet makes a ton of sense.</p><p>MicroStrategy is a business generating tens of millions of dollars in annual cash flow from operations, they've got almost no long-term debt, and they have access to some of the cheapest capital in the world.</p><p>They also have an ongoing Bitcoin bet that has returned over 50% in a few months, and this offering gives them an opportunity to almost double the stakes.</p><p>Let's break down the potential upside and downside of MicroStrategy's latest debt offering.</p><h2>Microstrategy's Debt Offering</h2><p>First, let's look at the type of debt MicroStrategy offered investors.</p><p>They offered "unsecured senior convertible notes", a quick break-down of the term is below.</p><p><strong>Unsecured:</strong> Microstrategy is not giving investors ownership of any assets as collateral. For investors, this obviously comes with a higher risk than debt secured by some underlying asset like real estate or equipment.</p><p><strong>Convertible:</strong> Microstrategy can convert this debt into shares of Microstrategy or cash. The equity conversion rate for the notes will be 2.5126 shares of MicroStrategy per $1,000 of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $397.99 per share. Microstrategy currently trades for less, so this strategy only makes sense when the stock value rises above $398.</p><p><strong>Senior:</strong> If Microstrategy defaults on its debt, company assets are paid out to creditors in priority sequence.</p><p>Secured debt is paid off first, then unsecured debt, and then finally the equity shareholders get whatever is left (if anything). Within each priority level, there are sub-levels of priority. Senior secured debt is paid back before junior secured debt, senior notes are paid off before junior notes, and preferred stock is paid off before common stock.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> A particular kind of corporate debt, typically with a maturity period of 10 years or less.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Debt Offering Timeline</h3><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy's intention was to offer:</p><ul role="list"><li>$400M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $60M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 9th, MicroStrategy officially priced their offering at:</p><ul role="list"><li>$550M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025, with a semi-annual interest payment at 0.75% APY</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $100M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 11th, MicroStrategy closed the round of fundraising, and sold the extra $100 million option too. As a result, their net proceeds were $634.9 million after fees.</p><p>And with that money, they plan to buy more Bitcoin - since they've already converted 100% of their cash and short-term investments into Bitcoin.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Bet In A Nutshell</h3><p>Here's what this entire bet boils down to.</p><p>MicroStrategy must pay $4.9M in each of the next five years as interest on their debt offering. That adds up to $24.4M in interest payments, plus a lump sum payment of the $650M original debt offering in December 2025.</p><p>That's a grand total of $674.4M paid off over the course of 5 years.</p><p>But there's a bonus option for MicroStrategy. If their Bitcoin bet pays off and they want to de-leverage, or if their stock price rises above $400, they have the option to convert some or all of the debt into equity or cash.</p><p>From the $650M offering, MicroStrategy expects to keep $634.9M that they can invest in Bitcoin. The other $15.1 million goes towards various fees and commissions.</p><p>Therefore, to turn their $634.9M into $674.4M, they'll just need a 1.2% annual return on their Bitcoin investment. </p><p>In other words, assuming MicroStrategy acquires Bitcoin around $18,750 per coin, they'll have paid for all 5 years of interest payments once Bitcoin hits $19,916 per coin. Anything above that is all profit.</p><h2>MicroStrategy's Upside Potential</h2><h3>How Much Could MicroStrategy Make?</h3><p>MicroStrategy has made 3 prior Bitcoin purchases.</p><ul role="list"><li>They're up $152M (61%) on their $250M August investment</li><li>They're up $140M (80%) on their $175M September investment</li><li>They're roughly even on their $50M December investment (made last week).</li></ul><p>All together, their $475M of cash is now worth $765M (up 61%) in just a few months.</p><p>With this $634.9M of cash from investors, they can buy just under 35,000 more coins. Since they already have 40,824 BTC, they will likely hold over 75,000 BTC by the end of December.</p><h3>How Much Higher Might Bitcoin Go?</h3><p>Obviously this is unknowable, and no prediction will be perfect when we look back five years from now. Still, there are enough influential figures in finance who have put out Bitcoin price predictions that it would be unwise to ignore them completely.</p><p>In addition, these people have all been successful capital allocators outside of the Bitcoin world, so their stance on Bitcoin as an asset class is less biased than the price predictions one might find on Bitcoin Twitter. They don't need Bitcoin to succeed, but they still think it will.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwHI6OC3rc8">Raoul Pal</a>: $1M per coin in the next five years</p><p><a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/the-case-for-500k-bitcoin/">Winklevoss Twins</a>: $500k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/classicmacro/status/1327381449000034307">Citibank Analyst Tom Fitzpatrick</a>: A move as high as $318k per coin by December 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/12/social-capitals-palihapitiya-says-bitcoin-is-going-to-1-million-in-the-next-20-years.html">Chamath Palihapitiya [in 2017]</a>: Probably 100k per coin in the next 3-4 years, and I think it is in the next 20 years, $1M per coin</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1328492371353489408">Mike Novogratz</a>: Going to 65k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p>I'm sure I've missed a handful of price predictions, but you get the point.</p><p>On the high end, if Bitcoin gets to $1M/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $75B by 2025.</p><p>On the low end, if Bitcoin gets to $65k/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $4.9B by 2025.</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Microstrategy has massive upside potential if Bitcoin's price gets anywhere close to the predictions above. But what if it doesn't?</p><h2>Microstrategy's Downside Risk</h2><h3><strong>What Happens To MicroStrategy If Bitcoin Goes Down?</strong></h3><p>It's possible that Bitcoin's price in December 2025 may be lower than it is today, but it's not very likely. In its 12 year history, Bitcoin has never traded down over a five year period, and it's not even close. 5 years ago, it was trading for $436. It is now trading for $18,750.</p><p>That's a 42x gain since December 12, 2015.</p><p>Still, the past isn't always a good predictor of the future, so let's explore MicroStrategy's options if Bitcoin does have a negative 5 year return.</p><p>Microstrategy has a profitable business generating tens of millions of dollars in operating cash flow each year. In fact, from 2016-2019 they've averaged $65M of cash flow from operations per year.</p><p>That's plenty of safety margin to take care of their $4.12 million annual interest payment, assuming zero business growth and zero inflation. If either one is positive, it will be even easier to meet their interest payment obligations.</p><h3>What Happens If Bitcoin And MicroStrategy Go Down?</h3><p>Ok, but what happens if Microstrategy's business doesn't generate any cash in the next five years, and the price of Bitcoin is lower in 2025?</p><p>Even more unlikely considering MicroStrategy's track record of success dates back to 1989, but let's entertain the possibility. What can MicroStrategy do about a rough spell for both Bitcoin and their business?</p><p>First, they could issue more debt.</p><p>MicroStrategy's largest long-term liability is its office space, and otherwise the company carries almost no long-term debt on their balance sheet.</p><p>At a time when central banks are relentlessly printing money, and bond yields are basically zero, raising another round of low-interest capital in the future won't be a challenge.</p><p>Second, a remote-first future means they may not even have to raise more money.</p><p>Prior to 2020, Michael Saylor strongly believed in-person work was important for MicroStrategy's success, but the global lockdown in the spring changed his mind.</p><p>If MicroStrategy does pursue a long-term remote work approach, that eliminates their largest long-term liability. As their $100M of lease obligations for office space gradually expires, the extra money can help fund their debt interest payments. It's not a big enough saving to pay off their debt principal, but it gives them extra time to either raise more capital or improve their business cash flows.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>MicroStrategy investors didn't run the numbers when they heard of this debt offering announcement last week, they panicked.</p><p>Microstrategy is a well-run, capital efficient business that took advantage of low interest rates to protect their purchasing power. While their Bitcoin allocation is aggressive by Wall Street standards, it's nothing that might risk the future of their software business.</p><p>And if it works out, it will be remembered as a bold (and very successful) bet that permanently shifted the way Wall Street thinks about Bitcoin.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>The last time we talked about software architecture, I introduced you to<a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/11/22/layered-architecture-what-is-layered-architecture-and-when-to-use-it/"> Layered Architecture</a>. Today we will start with Clean architecture (also called Onion or Ports and adapters architecture) and more specifically domain-driven design.</p>



<p>Clean architecture as a concept is significantly more complex than layered architecture. So I decided to split the article into two parts. In today’s article, I will try to explain the idea behind Domain-driven design simply.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Domain-driven design?</strong></h2>



<p>We need to understand domain-driven design because it lies in the center of Clean architecture (figuratively and literally).</p>



<p>Domain-driven design has its technicalities (that we are going to inspect in detail), but in the first place, DDD is a way of thinking.</p>



<p>As we can see from the name, this design approach is driven by the business domain. Or, said another way, we focus entirely on the business logic of the domain.</p>



<p>Integration and infrastructure features we consider details that the domain model <strong>does not know nor depend on</strong>.</p>



<p>In turn, the business domain can have sub-domains, and these sub-domains are isolated from each other as much as possible.</p>



<p>Let’s provide a simple example. Suppose we have to create an application for a food delivery system using domain-driven design.</p>



<p>The domain here is the entire process of ordering, payment, communication with the restaurant, and delivery and tracking.</p>



<p>And the sub-domains, as we can see, are order management, delivery management, etc.</p>



<p>Using DDD toward the example above should create an encapsulated core consisting of clearly defined business entities with strict boundaries. Don’t get panic. We will explain everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design first steps</strong></h2>



<p>The hardest thing about domain-driven design is building the right logical model of the domain and its sub-domains and defining proper boundaries. That is something that the developers <strong>can’t and should not do alone</strong>.</p>



<p>Developers should work in <strong>very close</strong> collaboration with the business people. Only business people know how exactly they operate their business, and only they can clarify the domain and subdomains to the developers.</p>



<p>At this point, developers <strong>should not</strong> take into consideration any technicalities, any. Their mission is to model the domain and its sub-domains only through the business logic point of view. They don’t think about databases, persistence, representation, other integrations, etc. The models they create are pure objects limited to any external dependencies.</p>



<p>Developers and business people should create a common language for business objects in the system. This common language is called <strong>ubiquitous language</strong>. Behind that fancy word hides the simple goal for common understanding. Terms (this also applies to the code) should be named so anybody can understand them.</p>



<p>Before continue with the main domain-driven design elements, let’s clarify some terms.</p>



<h3><strong>Bounded context</strong></h3>



<p>Bounded context is a pattern whose main idea is to draw boundaries between different sub-domains. We do this because we want each sub-domain to be as independent as possible.</p>



<p>From the example above, we see that our food delivery system has different sub-domains. Two of these sub-domains are order management and delivery management. The models that represent the two sub-domains should be isolated. Order management models shouldn’t know anything about the delivery models and vice versa.</p>



<p>If we have a model that should be represented in the two sub-domains, we duplicate that model. For example â€“ both sub-domains need a customer as a model. When we copy the model, we extract only the required properties for the specific sub-domain.&nbsp; So it is normal to have a model with the same name but with different properties in different sub-domains (of-course, we track that model by uniform ID in both sub-domains).</p>



<h3><strong>Anemic vs. rich models</strong></h3>



<p>For domain models, there are two concepts. They are anemic and rich model implementation.</p>



<p>Anemic models are models with only properties without any logic. Often they are also badly encapsulated using just public setters and getters. For example, anemic models we use when we have a database-centric architecture (like layered architecture).</p>



<p>Rich models have business logic. They are very well encapsulated. Instead of public setters and getters, we use methods for all the specific operations. Rich model collections are read-only and can only be modified through the methods and the constructor. Rich models can not be created nor exist in an invalid state. The implementation should guarantee that after any operation, the model is in a valid state.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, as you might guess, we use rich models.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design elements</strong></h2>



<p>Using the domain-driven design, we will face several different elements that build the core of it. They are:</p>



<ul><li>Entity</li><li>Value object</li><li>Aggregate (and Aggregate root)</li><li>Domain event</li><li>Factory</li><li>Repository</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Entity</strong></h3>



<p>An entity in domain-driven design is a rich model element that has a unique identification. For example, we might have an Order entity. Â&nbsp;The Order entity has an identifier (like autoincrement bigint). Using that identification, we track the entity and build relations.</p>



<h3><strong>Value object</strong></h3>



<p>Value objects are model elements that do not have a specific identification. Their identification is based on the comparison (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/equality-comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by value</a>) of all their attributes.</p>



<p>They also can contain business logic. Value objects mainly live as attributes of other entities.</p>



<p>A good example of a value object is the delivery address of the Order entity.</p>



<h3><strong>Aggregate</strong></h3>



<p>Aggregate is a very specific structure for the domain-driven design.</p>



<p>An aggregate is a group of objects that should be handled together. Every aggregate has an <strong>aggregate root</strong>. The aggregate root is the main object responsible for the control of the other objects.</p>



<p>Any command or request toward the elements in the aggregate should come through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>In our example, with the food delivery system, such an aggregate is the grouping of Order and OrderItem entities. In this case, the Order entity is the aggregate root. If we want to add a new OrderItem to the Order, we should do it through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>Entities that are “below” the root level should not allow state modification outside the aggregate.</p>



<p>Using aggregates, we strive to achieve an always valid business model.</p>



<h3><strong>Domain event</strong></h3>



<p>In domain-driven design, as we said, the models should be encapsulated and isolated as much as possible.</p>



<p>For example, the Order aggregate should not reference or be referenced by the Delivery aggregate.</p>



<p>They not only should not know about each other but also contract-based injection is forbidden.</p>



<p>The only right way of communication is through domain events (some of you may argue, but I firmly believe that).</p>



<p>Every aggregate can publish and subscribe to events.</p>



<p>If a new order is created, the Order aggregate publishes OrderCreatedEvent event. Every other aggregate that is interested in this event can handle it and process it.</p>



<p>Domain events are part of the domain model, but their artifacts are processed outside the domain layer. In the next article, we will see that in detail.</p>



<h3><strong>Factory</strong></h3>



<p>As most of you know, a factory is a design pattern for creating objects. In domain-driven design, the factory pattern isolates the creation of domain aggregates from the application layer.</p>



<p>In the best-case scenario, a factory should receive plain DTO (or just primitive types) and contains as little as possible logic.</p>



<p>Factory pattern should always create objects in a valid state.</p>



<h3><strong>Repository</strong></h3>



<p>The Repository is another well know pattern. The idea behind it is to encapsulate communication to the data storage and provide a layer of abstraction.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, each aggregate root has a repository. But as we said, the domain model should not be familiar with any infrastructure mechanisms. That’s why we don’t put repository implementations in the domain model but the infrastructure layer.</p>



<p>In the domain model, we put only the contracts (interfaces) of the repositories. That also will be discussed in detail in the next article.</p>



<h2>Domain-driven design in short</h2>



<p>Let’s summarize.</p>



<p>Domain-driven design is a <strong>way of thinking</strong>.</p>



<p>Working very <strong>closely with the business people</strong>, we aim to model the different domains of the business.</p>



<p>We create models (entities, value objects, aggregates) using <strong>only simple classes and primitive types</strong>. We don’t care about persistence, UI, external integrations, external libraries, etc. These things don’t belong in our domain core.</p>



<p>Models <strong>have complex logic</strong>, but we <strong>strictly</strong> <strong>encapsulate</strong> that behavior. They are <strong>always in a valid state</strong>, even after their initial creation.</p>



<p>Often we group different models because they can not live in a valid state only by themselves. Those groups we call <strong>aggregates</strong>.</p>



<p>Models live in isolation, so they can not communicate directly. For that reason, we use <strong>domain events</strong>.</p>



<p>The domain core <strong>does not depend on anything</strong>. Other layers (like application and infrastructure) depend on it.</p>



<h2><strong>What is next?</strong></h2>



<p>As I said above, domain-driven design is a core concept of Clean <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/category/software-design-and-architecture/">architecture</a>, and that’s why it is essential to get comfortable with that way of thinking. It is entirely normal to be confused at first, but this should not discourage you.</p>



<p>As a next step, I suggest you read Eric Evans’s excellent book “Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software”. While reading it, try to apply the knowledge to systems you have already developed without DDD. Believe me, that exercise will help you a lot.</p>



<p>In the next article, we will see how the domain model fits in the Clean architecture structure and the point behind all this complexity.</p>

    <p>Recently Google Photos ended their unlimited storage. You shouldn’t have been shocked, because unlimited is more often than not an unsustainable Ponzi Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="good-at-business">Good at Business</h2>

<p>When a software company gives you unlimited storage for anything, the only way for them to maintain that business in the long run is for them to make (amortized or not) incremental and recurring money from each thing they store. This is true, because storage is a recurring and forever cost.</p>

<p>Most B2C companies don’t make recurring money off of the data they store for you. They make money inversely proportional to how recent you stored the thing. Sometimes they don’t make any money at all. So it’s no surprise that unlimited is a Ponzi scheme, because that’s the only way to make the ledger look right.</p>

<h2 id="the-unlimited-ponzi-scheme">The Unlimited Ponzi Scheme</h2>

<p>Businesses will often follow a Ponzi Scheme-esque model with storage for their product. As they go through growth, newer customers are instantly delivering new revenue while their cost is very little - they haven’t started accruing much data. These customers offset older customers, who are getting more expensive as data retention continues forever.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the growth stops. You’ve gained most of the market you’re going to gain.  All of the sudden margin starts to slip. Fewer new users exist to offset the old users People look into and realize the unlimited scheme is up. Then they implement a retention policy and customers freak out.</p>

<h2 id="handling-unlimited-as-a-business">Handling Unlimited as a Business</h2>

<p>Businesses often fail at unlimited in a few ways.</p>

<p>First, companies should offer a way to pay more to get more storage. I can’t be mad that you won’t run a ridiculous business for me. I will get mad if you sink me into your product and don’t give me the option to pay a fair value to continue service.</p>

<p>Second, companies should be mindful of data retention policies from day 1.  The unlimited Ponzhi scheme is in many products not something that companies even know is happening. Things look good  until they don’t.</p>

<p>If you keep data around without retention policies, you will face a long road of performance, stability, and customer issues as you scale. Especially as your growth numbers slow, you should be mindful of the upcoming business realities sooner rather than later if you have anything that is unlimited in your product.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There’s no free lunch in this world unless you’re willing to run around to different dumpsters to get it.</p>

<p>HermiTux is a <a href="http://unikernel.org/">unikernel</a>: a minimal operating system
with low memory/disk footprint and sub-second boot time, executing an
application within a single address space on top of an hypervisor. Moreover,
HermiTux is <strong>binary-compatible</strong> with Linux: it can run native Linux
executables.</p>

<p>Although being a proof-of-concept, HermiTux supports multiple compiled (C, C++,
Fortran) and interpreted (Python, LUA) languages. It provides binary analysis
and rewriting techniques to optimize system call latency and modularize a
kernel in the presence of unmodified binaries. It supports statically and
dynamically linked programs, different compilers and optimization levels.
HermiTux also provides basic support for multithreading, debugging and
profiling.</p>

<p>HermiTux uses a lightweight KVM-based hypervisor that loads the Linux binary
alongside a minimal OS layer within a single address space virtual machine. At

<p>Optionally, HermiTux provides a mechanism to rewrite system call invocation
into common function calls to the kernel, significantly reducing the system
call latency.</p>

<p>HermiTux can also analyze a Linux binary to determine which system calls it
invokes, and compile a custom kernel containing only the implementations of
these particular system calls.</p>

  <div>
    <p>In news that surprises nobody, Goodreads last week quietly announced the deprecation of their public APIs. And I mean really quietly – the only people who were told about this were those unfortunate enough to have their existing <a href="https://blog.stephanieawilkinson.com/posts/2020-12-10-yonderbook-and-goodreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API keys disabled</a> without warning. Other than a small banner at the top of the API docs which mentions vague “plans to retire these tools”, nobody else appears to have heard anything from Goodreads, including those whose API keys remain active. So far it seems any key unused for 30 days has been disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://joealcorn.co.uk/assets/img/posts/2020/12/deprecated.png" alt="Deprecation notice on Goodreads API documentation"></p>

<p>So this is an “announcement” much in the way a windshield announces its presence to bugs on a highway, and with the same consequences: dead bugs. Some developers have taken to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21788520-api-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API discussion boards</a> and blogs, but the overall impression I’m getting is grim acceptance. Really the surprising thing is how long it took them: Amazon has been in charge at Goodreads for almost 8 years now, and I think we’ve all been expecting this to come at some point.</p>

<p>So why now? What’s changed? Well, the fact is the market’s changing – and Goodreads isn’t. Alternative options are starting to emerge, and since Goodreads has forgotten how to innovate, it wants to use its market position to stifle innovation instead.</p>

<p>The sad thing is it really only hurts the hobbyist projects and Goodreads users themselves. Anybody seriously attempting to compete with Goodreads is well aware of the Amazon-shaped elephant in the room and is likely prepared. It’s the users and the hackers that this move will harm, and if anything it further reinforces the need for viable alternatives.</p>

<p>Personally I’m going to continue pouring my efforts into building <a href="https://beta.readng.co/?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readng</a>. I’m already using it to keep track of my reads &amp; collections, along with a few thousand beta testers. I’m really excited by our plans and think we have the right team to execute, but we also need a shift in consumer behaviour.</p>

<p>The web has to mature beyond advertising as a business model. For this to happen people are going to have to open their wallets, pay for the services they use, and support independent businesses. That’s how we build a web where indies can thrive - one that’s more village centre than financial centre. I think the shift is underway.</p>


<hr>

<p>PS: <a href="https://beta.readng.co/user/joe?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s my own readng profile</a>. You should probably use our Goodreads importer while our API key works, huh?</p>

    <p>by Francis Tseng</p>

<p>The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.</p>

<p><a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation">The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities</a>, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/">Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”</a> that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Urbit, “<a href="https://urbit.org/">a personal server built from scratch</a>,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.</p>

<p>My central question is this: <em>Is Urbit a project that should be supported?</em></p>

<p>We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?</p>

<p>The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government</a>. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a> is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/">one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right</a>. From 2007 to 2014<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and in parallel with his political writings<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik">Dog-whistles</a> have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his <a href="https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt</a> for questions around Urbit’s governance.</p>

<p>To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis">here</a>, <a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/">here</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">here</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/">Against Political Freedom</a>,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">neoreactionary” movement</a>, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">with Peter Thiel</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon">Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön</a>, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.</p>

<h2 id="urbit">Urbit</h2>
<h4 id="a-self-sovereign-internet">A self-sovereign internet</h4>

<p>Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).</p>

<p>Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. <em>But</em>, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> of corporate tyranny and serfdom.</p>

<p>To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html">a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists</a>”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.</p>

<p>In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?</p>

<p>One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt">used to use explicitly feudal metaphors</a> as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.</p>

<p>In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, ch. 7.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Active Listening</em>:<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
<a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/active-listening.pdf">Active Listening</a>, p. 2</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, advice and information are almost always seen as efforts to change a person and thus serve as barriers to his self-expression and the development of a creative relationship.</p></blockquote><p>You can find similar advice in most books on relationships, people management, etc.</p><p>This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want <em>results</em>, not to grouse into the void!<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
Empirically, I did notice that I usually got better results from listening than from giving advice. So I inferred that this advice was true for other people, but not me, because other people didn’t actually want to fix their problems.</span></span></sup></p><p>Frequently the “just listen” advice comes with tactical tips, like “reflect what people said back to you to prove that you’re listening.” For instance, consider these example dialogues from <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>:<sup><label for="sn3">§</label><span><span><sup>§</sup>
<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, Chapter 7, Exercise 5.5, 5.6 and solutions.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</p><p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?</p></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><p>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him.</p><p>Person B: So you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than he is?</p></blockquote><p>I say this with great respect for <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, but these sound like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">1970s-era chatbot</a>. If I were Person A in either of these dialogues my next line would be “yes, you dingbat—can you turn the nonviolence down a couple notches?” I’d feel alienated knowing that someone is going through their NVC checklist on me.</p><hr><p>Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners <em>do</em> often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank">cargo cult advice</a>: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s <em>generating</em> that surface appearance.</p><p>The generator is curiosity.</p><p>When I’ve listened the most effectively to people, it’s because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a <em>detailed, precise</em> understanding of what was going on in their head. When a friend says, “I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him,” that one sentence has a huge amount underneath. How often does she need him? What does she need him for? Why isn’t he around? Have they talked about it? If so, what did he say? If not, why not?</p><p>It turns out that <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding" target="_blank">open it up and see the gears inside</a>. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.</p><p>Some stories from recent memory:</p><ul><li><p>When we started doing a pair programming rotation at Wave, I suggested that, to make scheduling easier, we designate a default time when pairing sessions would happen. A coworker objected that this seemed authoritarian. I was extremely puzzled, but they’d previously mentioned being an anarchist, so I was tempted to just chalk it up to a political disagreement and move on. But instead I tried to get curious and explore more deeply whatever “political” models were generating that disagreement. After a lot of digging into what was or wasn’t authoritarian for them and why, it turned out the disagreement was because they’d missed the word “default” and thought I was suggesting a single <em>mandatory</em> time for pair programming.</p></li><li><p>My partner, Eve, wrote a post about Polish attitudes about sex, with some details that upset her (Polish) parents. When her parents told her that, she initially got very stressed about having to have a conversation to calm them down. I thought she shouldn’t be worried and the conversation would be fine, but of course just telling her that wasn’t very helpful. Instead, I summoned up my curiosity and asked lots of questions about her relationship with her parents, her parents’ relationship with each other, each of their relationships with Catholicism, etc. By the end of the conversation, after thinking through all the baggage involved, Eve agreed with me, and her attitude about the upcoming conversation shifted from impending doom to compassionate curiosity about where her parents were coming from.</p></li><li><p>I was stressed by work and complained to Eve about some things that I felt frustrated and stuck about. Instead of suggesting solutions, she kept asking for more details until she had more or less a complete snapshot of my mental state. At that point, she observed that every time I mentioned feeling sad, I sounded contemptuous and exasperated with myself. She hypothesized that I wasn’t giving myself permission to be sad. The “solution” to my problem ended up being to give me a big hug and let me cry on her shoulder for a bit, after which I immediately felt much less stressed.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the “helper” tried to learn about the “complainer’s” reality in as much detail as possible—not just the problem, but the whole person and whatever else was behind the immediate issue. And that’s what made it possible for them to actually help.</p><p>It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I’m usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I’m talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.</p><p>It turns out this is a really common failure mode of helping-conversations, which is what I think generates the old saw at the beginning of this post, that “sometimes people don’t want help, just to be listened to.”</p><p>But I think that’s actually too nice to the helper, and uncharitable to the complainer (in that it assumes they weirdly don’t care about solving their problem). What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.</p><hr><p>When I’m curious about what someone’s saying, I often do repeat things back to them in my own words. But it’s because I’m genuinely curious, not because I’m checking off the “reflect words” box in my “be a good listener” checklist. That means I do it in a way that sounds like my natural speech, instead of mimicking them like a chatbot.</p><p>When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It’s a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say. Putting their idea into my own words shows them that I’ve fully digested it, and helps us establish a shared language in which to talk about it. That, in turn, makes the conversation fluent and collaborative, rather than a zigzag of bad assumptions and corrections.</p><p>So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can. Once you’ve done that, your advice will be more likely hit the mark, and you’ll be able to communicate it clearly.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>To start: yes, long time no see. Well, COVID-19 has been like that. Some days I
feel accomplished if I successfully check my email. I finally managed to clear
out a backlog of an entire handfull of things that needed thoughtful responses,
though, and so here I am, screaming into the void instead of at anyone in
particular.</p>
<p>That said, let's talk a bit about radios. It is probably unsurprising by now
that I have a long-running interest in radio and especially digital radio
communications---but people who come to radio from all kinds of different
perspectives run into one odd problem: the curious refusal of any receiver
to tune to certain frequencies in the 800-900MHz range.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a general knowledge that this has to do with some kind of
legal prohibition on reception of cellular phones. That's roughly correct, but
to fully explain the matter requires going into some depth on two different
topics: FCC regulation of radio devices, and the development of cellular
phones. The first sounds more boring, so let's hit that one first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most electronic products manufactured or imported into the
United States are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission. Specifically, they generally require an "Equipment Authorization"
from the FCC prior to being marketed. For purposes of this regulatory scheme,
electronic devices can be broadly divided into two categories: intentional
radiators and unintentional radiators.</p>
<p>An intentional radiator is something that is specifically intended to broadcast
a radio signal, like, say, a cellular phone. Intentional radiators must be
certified to comply with the specific Part of the FCC regulations relevant to
the service for which they will be used. For example, cellular phones must be
certified against Part 27, Wireless Communications Service, among others. The
exact process varies by the part and can be involved, but it generally
involves the manufacturer paying a certified test lab to perform certain tests
and complying with various other filing requirements which include placing a
label on the device which specifies its FCC approval. Device manufacturers
must file with the FCC a description of how this label will appear before they
receive approval to market the device, which is why the rough designs of
unreleased devices are sometimes revealed by the rough drawings in these
filings---tech journalists will watch these to get the dimensions of new
iPhones, for example.</p>
<p>By the way, when I say the "FCC Regulations," if you want to follow along at
home these are promulgated as 47 CFR. So Part 27, for example, refers to 47 CFR
27. The ever lovely Cornell LII has the whole thing for your entertainment:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47. There's some reading for when you need
help falling asleep.</p>
<p>But that's all besides the point, I'm more interested in talking about
unintentional radiators, devices which are not intended to produce RF radiation
but may still do so as a result of the operation of the electronics---this is
generally called a spurious emission, which is basically any RF emitted by
accident. These devices are certified under Part 15 of the FCC regulations[1],
and so are sometimes called "Part 15 devices." Part 15 essentially limits the
type and amplitude of spurious emissions to prevent random devices causing
harmful interference due to defects in their designs.</p>
<p>What would we call a radio <em>receiver</em>, then? It is explicitly a radio device,
but is not intended to transmit anything. As a result, radio receivers are Part
15 devices. Most of Part 15 is very general and doesn't really say anything
specific about radio devices, it just limits spurious emissions and other
design standards. However, 15.121 gets a great deal more specific in
discussing "Scanning receivers.' A scanning receiver is specifically defined
earlier in the regulation as a device capable of tuning to two or more frequency
bands in the range of 30-960Mhz. This has the fun result that nothing for the
GHz range is technically a scanner, but for practical reasons this doesn't
matter too much.</p>
<p>So what's in 15.121? This is:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(a): ... scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or
marketed for use with scanning receivers, shall: (1) Be incapable of operating
(tuning), or readily being altered by the user to operate, within the frequency
bands allocated to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this
chapter (cellular telephone bands). ... (b) Be designed so that the tuning,
control and filtering circuitry is inaccessible. The design must be such that
any attempts to modify the equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular
Radiotelephone Service likely will render the receiver inoperable. </p>
<p>The rest of paragraph (a) gives a pretty long clarification of "readily being
altered by the user," and it's amusing to think of a bunch of FCC characters
sitting around a table trying to think up every alteration that is easy.
Jumper wires and reprogramming micro-controllers are both right out.</p>
<p>It gets even better:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(b): ... scanning receivers shall reject any signals from the
Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based
upon a 12 dB SINAD measurement, which is considered the threshold where a
signal can be clearly discerned from any interference that may be present. </p>
<p>So, here's this actual weird rule about scanners. Scanners are specifically
prohibited from being able to tune to any bands allocated to the Part 22
Cellular Radiotelephone Service. This raises questions, and as you can imagine
from the way I got here, I am about to spend a long time answering them.</p>
<p>When the FCC says "Cellular Radiotelephone Service," they aren't talking about
cell phones in general. The CRS as I'll call it refers to a <em>very specific</em>
cellular service, and that is AMPS.</p>
<p>AMPS, the Advanced Mobile Phone System, is the most common in the US of the
"1G" cellular services. Most carriers that were around when it was offered
called it "Analog" service, and indeed, AMPS was entirely analog. And, due to
an odd detail of the regulation, large cellular carriers were <em>required</em> to
offer AMPS service until 2008, long after AMPS phones were no longer produced.
You may have had a candy bar phone back when you would occasionally see an "A"
for analog service, but I hope not into the late 2000s.</p>
<p>There are a few things that we might infer from AMPS being an analog service.
One of those things is that it probably did not employ strong encryption. In
fact, AMPS employed no scrambling or enciphering of any kind. Your phone
conversations were just flapping in the wind for anyone to hear. This posed a
major practical problem for carriers in the '90s as it was discovered that it
was not particularly difficult to intercept the call setup process from an AMPS
phone and swipe its identification numbers, allowing you to basically steal
someone else's cellular service. You can imagine that this was popular with
certain criminals with a need for untraceable but convenient communications.</p>
<p>There was also a problem for consumers: their phone conversations could be
fairly easily overheard. There were a number of ways to do this, using any
radio scanner that covered that band for example. One particularly well-known
option was a particular model of phone, the Oki 900, that had an unusually
open design (in terms of modifiability) that led to reverse engineered and
modified firmware being developed that made eavesdropping on other people's
calls just, well, a feature it had.</p>
<p>The scale of this problem was fairly large, and it was fairly well known. For
example, let's turn to <em>my</em> favorite source of late-night reading, newspaper
archives. A lovely piece in the 30 May 1990 issue of The News and Observer,
from Raleigh NC, takes the cheesy headline "Monitoring Megahertz" and goes
into some depth on the issue.</p>
<p>"I've heard men call their wives and tell them they'll be home late, then call
their girl friends," quipped one electronics store owner who had "accidentally"
eavesdropped on cellular calls using a scanner. We've all fat-fingered our
ways into someone else's affairs I'm sure, pun intended. Another person said
"when you look at the fact that there are how many thousands of people out
there who know my name, my mailing address and my salary...I put cellular
eavesdropping down as being no different from that." In the face of technology,
even in 1990, people had begun to abandon their privacy.</p>
<p>Cellular carriers were not so happy about this, viewing it as an embarrassment
to their operation. I have heard before that cellular carriers went so far as
to lobby for banning scanners entirely, although I am not aware of much hard
evidence of this. What they did do was convince congress to stick an extra few
paragraphs onto an otherwise only tangentially related bit of legislation
called the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992. This has
largely to do with abusive 1-900 numbers, which is its whole own topic in
telephone regulation that I ought to take on sometime. But it also brought
along just a bit more, an extra section that was subsequently amended several
times at the behest of cellular carriers. Let's read part of it, as amended,
and with some editing for readability.</p>
<p>The Commission shall prescribe and make effective regulations denying equipment
authorization for any scanning receiver that is capable of---(A) receiving
transmissions in the frequencies allocated to the domestic cellular radio
telecommunications service, (B) readily being altered by the user to receive
transmissions in such frequencies, or (C) being equipped with decoders that
convert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.</p>
<p>Well, we've made it full circle: we've seen the regulation, and we've seen the
legislation that kicked the FCC to write the regulation. But how does this
translate today? Things get a bit weird there.</p>
<p>You see, the FCC seems to have (sensibly) …</p></article></div>
