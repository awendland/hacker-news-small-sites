                  <p><em>The tech executive turned data justice warrior is celebrated as a truth-telling hero, but there’s something a bit too smooth about this narrative arc.</em></p><div><p><img src="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg 799w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-300x200.jpg 300w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p><p><span>Credit: Stuart Isett/Fortune</span><span></span></p></div>
<p>A few months ago, I was contacted by a senior executive who was about to leave a marketing firm. He got in touch because I’ve worked on the non-profit side of tech for a long time, with lots of volunteering on digital and human rights. He wanted to ‘give back’. Could I put him in touch with digital rights activists? Sure. We met for coffee and I made some introductions. It was a perfectly lovely interaction with a perfectly lovely man. Perhaps he will do some good, sharing his expertise with the people working to save democracy and our private lives from the surveillance capitalism machine of his former employers. The way I rationalized helping him was: firstly, it’s nice to be nice; and secondly, movements are made of people who start off far apart but converge on a destination. And isn’t it an unqualified good when an insider decides to do the right thing, however late?</p>
<p>The Prodigal Son is a New Testament parable about two sons. One stays home to work the farm. The other cashes in his inheritance and gambles it away. When the gambler comes home, his father slaughters the fattened calf to celebrate, leaving the virtuous, hard-working brother to complain that all these years he wasn’t even given a small goat to share with his friends. His father replies that the prodigal son ‘was dead, now he’s alive; lost, now he’s found’. Cue party streamers. It’s a touching story of redemption, with a massive payload of moral hazard. It’s about coming home, saying sorry, being joyfully forgiven and starting again. Most of us would love to star in it, but few of us will be given the chance.</p>
<p>The Prodigal Tech Bro is a similar story, about tech executives who experience a sort of religious awakening. They suddenly see their former employers as toxic, and reinvent themselves as experts on taming the tech giants. They were lost and are now found. They are warmly welcomed home to the center of our discourse with invitations to write opeds for major newspapers, for think tank funding, book deals and TED talks. These guys – and yes, they are all guys – are generally thoughtful and well-meaning, and I wish them well. But I question why they seize so much attention and are awarded scarce resources, and why they’re given not just a second chance, but also the mantle of moral and expert authority.</p>
<p>I’m glad that Roger McNamee, the early Facebook investor, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">testified to the U.S. Congress</a> about Facebook’s wildly self-interested near-silence about its amplification of Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential election. I’m thrilled that Google’s ex-‘design ethicist’, Tristan Harris, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">the </a><em>closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience,</em>“(startlingly faint praise) now runs a Center for Humane Technology, exposing the mind-hacking tricks of his former employer. I even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hSrUaSNFSY&amp;t=2309s">spoke</a> —critically but, I hope, warmly—at the book launch of James Williams, another ex-Googler turned attention evangelist, who “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Humane_Technology">co-founded the movement</a>”of awareness of designed-in addiction. I wish all these guys well. I also wish that the many, exhausted activists who didn’t take money from Google or Facebook could have even a quarter of the attention, status and authority the Prodigal Techbro assumes is his birth-right.</p>
<p>Today, when the tide of public opinion on Big Tech is finally turning, the brothers (and sisters) who worked hard in the field all those years aren’t even invited to the party. No fattened calf for you, my all but unemployable tech activist. The moral hazard is clear; why would anyone do the right thing from the beginning when they can take the money, have their fun, and then, when the wind changes, convert their status and relative wealth into special pleading and a whole new career?</p>
<p>Just half an hour flipping through my contacts produced half a dozen friends and acquaintances who didn’t require a ‘road to Damascus’ conversion to see what was wrong with big tech or the ways governments abuse it. Nighat Dad runs the <a href="https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/">Digital Rights Foundation in Pakistan</a>, defending online freedom of expression and privacy for women, minorities and dissidents. That’s real courage. <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/people/95/gus-hosein">Gus Hosein</a> has worked in tech and human rights for over 20 years, runs Privacy International, the UK-based non-profit, and is the most visionary thinker I know on how to shake up our assumptions about why things are as they are.&nbsp; <a href="https://biancawylie.com/">Bianca Wylie </a>founded the volunteer-run Open Data Institute Toronto, and works on open data, citizen privacy and civic engagement. The “<a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/12/bianca-wylie-interview-toronto-quayside-protest-criticism/574477/">Jane Jacobs of the Smart Cities Age</a>,” she’s been a key figure in opening up and slowing down Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs juggernaut in Toronto. Aral Balkan runs <a href="https://small-tech.org/">Small Technology Foundation </a>and works on both the tools and the policies to resist surveillance capitalism. Unafraid of being unpopular, even with other activists, Balkan freely hammers rights organizations or conferences for taking big tech’s sponsorship money while criticizing the companies’ practices. In the western Balkans, <a href="https://hvale.me/">hvale vale</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"></a> works tirelessly and cheerfully on women’s rights, sexual rights and the political and practical path to a feminist internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Gross">Robin Gross</a>, &nbsp;a Californian intellectual property lawyer, could have put her persistence and sheer pizazz to work defending big entertainment companies, but instead she’s worked for decades against the copyright maximalism that strangles artists’ creativity and does nothing to increase their incomes. I would love to hear their voices amplified, not (just) the voices of those who took a decade and more to work out the rottenness at the core of big tech.</p>
<p>Ex-Google lobbyist Ross Lajeunesse left the company in 2019 over its censored search engine for China and also because of homophobic, sexist and racist work practices. He’s now running for a Democratic senate nomination, and recently wrote a classic of the ‘scales have fallen from my eyes’ genre, called “I Was Google’s Head of International Relations. <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">Here’s Why I Left</a>.” Its lede is <em>“The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil.” Things have changed.”</em></p>
<p>Really? Has Google really changed? Lajeunesse joined in 2008, years into Google’s multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes">tax avoidance</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-hit-with-job-discrimination-lawsuit/">sexist labor practices</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm">privacy hostility</a> and continued to work there through the years of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542">antitrust fines</a>, misuse of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40406542">personal health data</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-rejects-324-5m-wage-fixing-settlement-struck-by-apple-google-others/">wage fixing</a>, and financially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html">pressuring think tanks</a>. Google didn’t change. It just started treating some of its insiders like it already treated outsiders. That only looks like radical change if you’ve never thought too hard about what you are doing and to whom.</p>
<p>One hundred thousand people work for Google/Alphabet; some of them have much more power than others. The point isn’t whether Lajeunesse is or isn’t culpable for the many acts of the enormous company he represented—as its chief lobbyist in Asia for several years—it’s that of all the people who spent the decade of 2010-20 working thanklessly to expose and reduce the firm’s monopolistic abuse and assault on global privacy, it’s the ex-lobbyist who gets our attention now.</p>
<p>We all need second chances. Even if we don’t need those fresh starts ourselves, we want to live in a world where people have a reason to do better. But the prodigal tech bro’s redemption arc is so quick and smooth it’s barely a road bump. That’s because we keep skipping the most important part of the prodigal son story—where he hits rock bottom. In the original parable, the prodigal son wakes up in a pig sty, starving, and realizes his father’s servants now live better than he does. He resolves to go home to the people and place he did not value or respect before. He will beg to be one of his father’s servants. He accepts his complete loss of status. But instead of chastising and punishing his prodigal son, the rejoicing father greets him joyfully and heads off the apology with a huge party. It’s a great metaphor for how to run a religion, but a lousy way to run everything else.</p>
<p>Prodigal tech bro stories skip straight from the past, when they were part of something that—surprise!—turned out to be bad, to the present, where they are now a moral authority on how to do good, but without the transitional moments of revelation and remorse. &nbsp;But the bit where you say you got things wrong and people were hurt? That’s the most important part. It’s why these corporatized reinventions feel so slick and tinny, and why so many of the comments on Lajeunesse’s <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">train wreck post</a> on Medium were critical. The journey feels fake. These ‘I was lost but now I’m found, please come to my TED talk’ accounts typically miss most of the actual journey, yet claim the moral authority of one who’s ‘been there’ but came back. It’s a teleportation machine, but for ethics.</p>
<p>(While we’re thinking about the neatly elided parts of the prodigal tech bro story, let’s dwell for one moment on the deletion of the entire stories of so many women and people of color barely given a first chance in Silicon Valley, let alone multiple reinventions.)</p>
<p>The only thing more fungible than cold, hard cash is privilege. The prodigal tech bro doesn’t so much take an off-ramp from the relatively high status and well-paid job he left when the scales fell from his eyes, as zoom up an on-ramp into a new sector that accepts the reputational currency he has accumulated. He’s not joining the resistance. He’s launching a new kind of start-up using his industry contacts for seed-funding in return for some reputation-laundering.</p>
<p>So what? Sure, it’s a little galling, but where’s the harm?</p>
<p>Allowing people who share responsibility for our tech dystopia to keep control of the narrative means we never get to the bottom of how and why we got here, and we artificially narrow the possibilities for where we go next. And centering people who were insiders before and claim to be leading the outsiders …</p></div></div></div>

  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-32-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 32 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_2.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 32 core"></p>
<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>
<p>You can play around with some Bevy WASM examples by <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples#wasm">following the instructions here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>
<h2 id="transform-system-rewrite">Transform System Rewrite</h2>
<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>
<pre><code><span>// old
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>translation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Translation, </span><span>rotation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Rotation, </span><span>scale</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scale</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> translation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> rotation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> scale</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// new
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>transform</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>translation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>scale</span><span>());
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>

<p>authors: @simpuid</p>
<p>The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs">gilrs</a> library!</p>

<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
</div>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="did-it-make-them-feel-more-able-to-raise-issues-with-me">Did it make them feel more able to raise issues with me?</h2>

<![CDATA[Why Rust is not a mature programming language]]>

				<p>While I have nothing against Rust as such and keep writing my pet project in Rust, there are still some deficiencies I find preventing Rust from being a proper programming language. Here I’d like to present them and explain why I deem them as such even if not all of them have any impact on me.<br>
<span id="more-1971"></span></p>
<h3>Rust language problems</h3>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>Rust does not have a formal language specification</strong> and by that I mean that while some bits like grammar and objects are explained, there are no formal rules to describe what language features can and cannot be. If you’ve ever looked at ISO C standard you’ve seen that almost any entity there has three or four parts in the description: formal syntax, constraints (i.e. what is not allowed or what can’t be done with it), semantics (i.e. what it does, how it impacts the program, what implementation caveats are there), and there may be some examples to illustrate the points. The best close equivalent in Rust is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rust Reference</a> and e.g. structure there is described in the following way: syntax (no objections there), definition in a form of “A struct is a nominal struct type defined with the keyword <code>struct</code>.”, examples, a brief mention of empty (or unit-like) structures in the middle of examples, and “The precise memory layout of a struct is not specified.” at the end. I understand that adding new features is more important than documenting them but this is lame.</p>
<p>A proper mature language (with 1.0 in its version) should have a formal specification that should be useful both for people developing compilers and the programmers trying to understand certain intricacies of the language and why it does not work as expected (more on that later). For example, for that <code>struct</code> definition I find lacking at least these: mentioning that you can have <code>impl</code> for it (even a reference would do—even if you have to repeat it for every type), split off tuples into a separate entry because it’s very different syntactically and raises a question why you have anonymous tuples and not anonymous structs (which you also can’t find from the documentation), and of course create proper layout so that rather important information (about memory layout for example) is not lost among examples.</p>
<p>And now to the specific problems I encounter quite often and I don’t know whether I understand it wrong or the compiler understands it wrong. And since there’s no formal specification I can’t tell which one it is (even if the former is most probable).</p>
<p><strong>Function/method calling convention.</strong> Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
struct Foo { a: i32 }<br>
impl Foo { fn bar(&amp;mut self, val: i32) { self.a = val + 42; } }<br>
fn main() {<br>
&nbsp; let mut foo = Foo { a: 0 };<br>
&nbsp; foo.bar(foo.a);<br>
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>For now this won’t compile because of the borrowing but shouldn’t the compiler be smart enough to create a copy of <code>foo.a</code> before call? I’m not sure but IIRC current implementation first mutably borrows object for the call and only then tries to borrow the arguments. Is it really so and if yes, why? <em>Update:</em> I’m told that newer versions of the compiler handle it just fine but the question still stands (was it just a compiler problem or the call definition has been changed?).</p>
<p>The other thing is the old C caveat of function arguments evaluation. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
let mut iter = “abc”.chars();<br>
foo(iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap());
</p></blockquote>
<p>So would it be <code>foo('a','b','c')</code> or <code>foo('c','b','a')</code> call. In C it’s undefined because it depends on how arguments are passed on the current platform (consider yourself lucky if you don’t remember <code>__pascal</code> or <code>__stdcall</code>). In Rust it’s undefined because there’s no formal specification to tell you even that much. And it would be even worse if you consider that you may use the same source for indexing the caller object like <code>handler[iter.next().unwrap() as usize].process(iter.next().unwrap());</code> in some theoretical bytecode handler (of course it’s a horrible way to write code and you should use named temporary variables but it should illustrate the problem).</p>
<p>And another source of annoyance for me is <strong>traits</strong>. I have almost no problems with owning/lifetime/borrowing concepts but traits get me almost every time. I’m vaguely aware that the answer to why the following problems exist is “because traits are implemented as a call table” but again, <em>should</em> they be implemented like that and what should be the constraints on them (after all the original object should be somehow linked to the trait pointer). So when you have a supertrait (i.e. <code>trait Foo: Bar</code>) you can’t easily cast it for subtrait (e.g. <code>&amp;Foo -&gt; &amp;Bar</code>) without writing a lot of boilerplate code. And even worse if you convert an object into <code>Box&lt;trait&gt;</code> there’s no way to get the original object back (still in boxed form of course; I remember seeing a special crate that implements a lot of boilerplate code in order to get a mutable reference though). To reiterate: the problem is not me being stupid but rather the lack of formal description on how it’s done and why what I want is so hard. Then I’d probably at least be able to realize how I should change my code to work around the limitations.</p>
<h3><code>rustc</code> problems</h3>
<p>No, I’m not going to talk about compilation speed. It’s certainly a nuisance but not a problem per se. Here I want to point rather theoretical problems that a mature language should not have. And having just one compiler is one of those problems (call that problem zero).</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>bootstrapping process</strong> is laughably bad. I realize that it’s never too easy but if you call yourself a systems programming language you should be able to bootstrap a compiler in a sane amount of steps. For instance, IIRC <code>Guix</code> has the following bootstrapping process for C compiler: simple C complier in Scheme (for which you can often write an implementation in assembly by hand) compiles TCC, TCC compiles GCC 2.95, GCC 2.95 compiles GCC 3.7, GCC 3.7 compiles GCC 4.9. For <code>rustc</code> you should either start with the original compiler written in OCaml and compile every following version with the previous one (i.e. 1.17 with 1.16) or cheat by using <code>mrustc</code> written in C++ which can compile Rust 1.19 or 1.29 (without borrow checks), then compile 1.30 with 1.29, 1.31 with 1.30 etc etc. The problem here is that you cannot skip versions and e.g. compile <code>rustc 1.46</code> with <code>rustc 1.36</code> (I’d be happy to learn that I’m wrong). IMO you should have maybe an ineffective compiler but written in a dialect that much older compiler should understand i.e. <code>rustc 1.0</code> should be able to compile a compiler for 1.10, which can be used to compile 1.20 and so forth. Of course it’s a huge waste of resources for rather theoretical problem but it may prove beneficial for compiler design itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s <strong>LLVM dependency.</strong> I understand that <code>LLVM</code> provides many advantages (like no need to worry about code generation for many platforms and optimising it) but it gives some disadvantages too. First, you don’t have a really self-hosting compiler (a theoretical problem but still a thing worth thinking about; also consider that you have to rely on a framework developed mostly by large corporations mostly in their own interests). Second, you’re limited by what it does e.g. I read complaints about debug builds being too slow mostly because of LLVM backend. And I suspect it still can’t do certain kinds of memory-related optimisations because it was designed with C++ compiler in mind which still has certain quirks regarding multiple memory access (plus IIRC there was one LLVM bug triggered by an infinite loop in Rust code that’s perfectly valid there but not according to C++ rules). I’m aware that <code>cranelift</code> exists (and Rust front-end for <code>GCC</code>) so hopefully this will be improved.</p>
<p>And finally there’s a thing related to the previous problem. Rust has poor <strong>support for assembly</strong>. Of course not so many people need standalone assembly and not inline one (which is still lacking but <code>asm!</code> is almost there) but languages oriented for systems programming support compiling assembly in addition to the higher-language code so it would be <em>proper</em> to support assembly files even with not so rich preprocessor syntax as GAS has. Fiddling with <code>build.rs</code> to invoke an external assembler is possible but not nice at all.</p>
<h3>Other Rust language problems</h3>
<p>There’s also one problem with Rust <code>std</code> library that I should mention too. It’s useless for interfacing OS. Now if I want to do something natural to any UNIX system I need to at least import <code>libc</code> crate <del datetime="2020-09-19T03:32:25+00:00">and link against an external libc</del> (it’s part of the runtime anyway). One solution would be that crate I heard of that wanted to translate <code>musl</code> into Rust so you can at least eliminate the linking step. But the proper solution would be to support at least OS-specific syscall() in <code>std</code> crate as many interesting libc functions are just a wrapper over it (like <code>open()</code>/<code>write()</code>/<code>ioctl()</code>; Windows is a different beast so I don’t mind if it’s <code>std::os::unix::syscall</code> and not something more common).</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not a Rust language architect and I’m extremely unlikely to become one but I have an opinion on what Rust lacks in order to become a proper mature language really fit for systems development (three things essentially: being fully self-hosted, having a specification, and being able to interface low-level stuff without resorting to C compiler or assembler). Hopefully this will be rectified despite the lack of Mozilla.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind Score and why it matters ?</h4>
              <p>For too long, aesthetics of a website has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As latest research demonstrates ( See recommended ref) , the visual appeal of a website is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness.</p>
              <p>Have you “fast-tested” your website? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your website to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters.</p>
              <p>Visual Mind score – provides you with a qualitative score about that first impression. It can help you evaluate your website aesthetics and make improvements.</p>
