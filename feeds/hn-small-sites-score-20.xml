				<p>Our backend system is built on <strong>AWS</strong>. Today I’m going to tell you how we had cut costs three times for the servers by using spot instances on the production environment. I’ll also walk you through configuring auto scaling. Firstly, you will see the overview of how it works and then we provide the instruction to launch it.</p><h2 id="what-are-spot-instances">What are spot instances?</h2><blockquote>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot instances</a> are spare compute capacity in the AWS cloud available at steep discounts. &nbsp;Amazon says they can reach 90%, in our experience, it is ~3x, varies depending on the region, AZ or instance type. Their main difference from the regular ones is that they can be shut down at any time.</blockquote><p>That’s why for a long time we thought it was okay to use them for DEV environments, or for calculating tasks with saving the intermediate result to S3 or database but not for PROD. There are third-party solutions that allow using spots for PROD, but we didn’t implement it due to numerous kludges to our case. The approach described in the article fully works within standard AWS capabilities, without additional scripts, crons, etc.</p><p>Next, I’m going to provide some screenshots which show spot instances pricing history.</p><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>eu-west-1</strong> region (Ireland). The price is predominantly stable within three months, cost-savings now are <strong>2.9x</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>m5.large</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

The price is constantly changing within three months, cost-savings now are from <strong>2.3x to 2.8x</strong> depending on availability zone.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" srcset="https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://blog.adapty.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w"></figure><p><strong>t3.small</strong> in <strong>us-east-1</strong> region (N.

It sends requests to <em>EC2 Target Group</em> (TG). TG is responsible for opening ports on the instances for ALB and connecting them to the container ports of <em>Elastic Container Service</em> (ECS). ECS is an analog of <em>Kubernetes</em> in AWS, which manages <em>Docker</em> containers.</p><p>One instance can have multiple functioning containers with the same ports that’s why we cannot assign them fixed. ECS reports to TG that it launches a new task (in Kubernetes terminology it is called <em>“Pod”</em>). It checks free ports on the instance and assigns one of them for the new launching task. Also, TG regularly checks if the instance and API are functioning with a health check. If it sees any problem, it stops sending requests there.</p><h4 id="ec2-auto-scaling-groups-ecs-capacity-providers-">EC2 Auto Scaling Groups + ECS Capacity Providers.</h4><p>In the diagram above, the <em>EC2 Auto Scaling Groups</em> (ASG) service is not indicated. We can learn from the title that it is in charge of auto scaling. However, AWS didn’t have built-in capability to manage the number of running machines from ECS until recently. ECS allowed scaling the number of tasks, for example, based on CPU or RAM usage or the number of requests. But if the tasks took all the available instances, new machines were not launched automatically.</p><p>This changed with <em>ECS Capacity Providers</em> (ECS CP). Every service in ECS can now be linked with ASG. And, if the tasks don’t have enough running instances, more instances will be started (but within the established limits of ASG). It works the other way around as well. If ECS CP sees standing idle instances, without tasks, it will command ASG to shut them down. ECS CP can indicate the target capacity percent of instancesso that a certain number of machines would always be available for rapid task scaling. We’ll talk about it later.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-templates-">EC2 Launch Templates.</h4><p>Before describing the creation of the infrastructure, the last service I’m going to talk about is <em>EC2 Launch Templates</em>. It allows creating a template to launch all the machines to avoid repeating it every time from scratch. Here you can choose the type of the launching machine, security group, disk image, and lots of other parameters. It’s possible to indicate user data as well that will be uploaded to all the running instances. You can run scripts in the user data, for example, you can edit the content of<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS agent configuration file</a>.</p><p>One of the most important configuration parameters in this article is<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-spot.html"> ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING</a>=true. If this parameter is <em>turned on</em>, then as soon as ECS receives a signal that the spot instance is being taken, it switches all its running tasks into <strong>Draining</strong> status. <em>No new tasks</em> will be assigned for this instance. If there are any tasks that are <strong>Pending</strong> on this instance, ECS cancels them. It no longer receives the requests from the balancer as well. You get the notification about deleting the instance two minutes before it happens. In this regard, if your service doesn’t execute the task for more than two minutes and doesn’t save anything to the disk, you can use spot instances without losing any data.</p><p>Talking about the disk, AWS has recently<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-ecs-aws-fargate-support-amazon-efs-filesystems-generally-available/#:~:text=To%20use%20EFS%20with%20ECS,or%20TLS%20encryption%20in%20transit."> made</a> it possible to use <em>Elastic File System</em> (EFS) with ECS. Even using the disk with this approach is not an obstacle, but we haven’t tested it, because we don’t need the disk to store the status. After receiving <strong>SIGINT</strong> by default (it is sent in the moment of task switch into <strong>Draining</strong> status) all the running tasks will be stopped in 30 sec, even if they haven’t completed. You can change this time with<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html"> ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT</a> parameter. The main rule is not to set it for more than 2 minutes for spot machines.</p><h2 id="-reating-a-service-">Сreating a service.</h2><p>Let’s proceed directly to create the described service. I’ll describe some useful features that were not mentioned above.</p><p>Generally, it’s a step-by-step instruction, but I won’t mention any basic or more specific cases. All the operations are made in <em>AWS Management Console</em>, but you can achieve the same results with <em>CloudFormation</em> or <em>Terraform</em>. We use Terraform in Adapty.</p><h4 id="ec2-launch-template-">EC2 Launch Template.</h4><p>With this service, you can create a configuration of machines. You can manage the templates in <em>EC2</em> → <em>Instances</em> → <em>Launch templates</em>.</p><p>Amazon machine image (AMI). Specify the disk image which will be used by instances. For ECS, in most cases, it’s better to use an optimized image from Amazon. It is regularly updated and contains everything necessary for ECS functioning. To find out the relevant image ID, go to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html"> Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs</a> page, choose the region, and copy AMI ID for it. For example, for us-east-1 region, relevant image ID at the time of this writing — <em>ami-00c7c1cf5bdc913ed</em>. You need to paste this ID to <strong>Specify a custom value</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Instance type.</strong> Specify an instance type. Choose the one that is best suited for your task.</p><p><strong>Key pair (login).</strong> Specify the certificate for SSH connection.</p><p><strong>Network settings.</strong> Specify network settings. The <strong>networking platform</strong> in most cases should be Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). <strong>Security groups</strong> serve to protect your instances. Since we’re going to use the balancer in front of the instances, I would recommend specifying the group which allows inbound connection only from the balancer. That means you will have two security groups: one for the balancer which allows inbound connections from anywhere via <em>80 (http)</em> and <em>443 (https)</em> ports, and the other one for the machines which allows inbound connections via any port from the balancer group. We have to open outbound connections in both the groups via <em>TCP protocol</em> to all the ports for all the addresses. We can limit the ports and addresses for the outbound connections, but in that case, &nbsp;it is necessary to constantly monitor that you’re not trying to address anywhere via the closed port.</p><p><strong><strong>Storage (volumes). </strong></strong>Specify the disk parameters for the machines. Disk capacity can’t be less than the one specified in AMI, for ECS Optimized, it is 30 GiB.</p><p><strong>Advanced details.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Purchasing option.</strong> </strong>It asks whether we want to buy spot instances. We do but <u>don’t mark</u> the checkbox here. We’ll configure it in <em>Auto Scaling Group</em>, it has more options there.</p><p><strong>IAM instance profile.</strong> Specify the role for the the instances. The instances need access rights to operate within ECS. The access rights are usually defined in <em>ecsInstanceRole</em>. In some cases, the role is existing in your AWS account. If not then here is the<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html"> instruction</a> on how to do it. After its creation, specify it in the template.</p><p>Next, there are a lot of parameters, basically, you can leave the default, but each of them has a comprehensible description. I always turn on <em>EBS-optimized instance</em> and <em>T2/T3 Unlimited</em> parameters, if we use<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html"> burstable</a> instances.</p><p><strong>User data.</strong> Specify user data. We will edit the file <em>/etc/ecs/ecs.config</em> which stores the ECS agent configuration.</p><p>Here is the example of how user data may look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
echo "ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA={\"registry.gitlab.com\":{\"username\":\"username\",\"password\":\"password\"}}" &gt;&gt; /etc/ecs/ecs.config
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECS_CLUSTER=DemoApiClusterProd</strong> — this parameter indicates that the instance belongs to a cluster with the given name which means this cluster will be able to place their tasks on this server. We still haven’t created a cluster, but we will use this name when creating it.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENABLE_SPOT_INSTANCE_DRAINING=true</strong> — the parameter points that after receiving a spot instance turn off signal, all the tasks must be switched to Draining status.</p><p><strong>ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT=1m</strong> — the parameter indicates that after receiving the SIGINT signal, all the tasks have one minute before being killed.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE=docker</strong> — the parameter indicates that we use a docker-scheme as an authentication format.</p><p><strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_DATA=...</strong> — these are the parameters of the connection to a private container registry, where all your Docker images are stored. If they are public there is no need to specify anything else.</p><p>In this article I will use a public image from <em>Docker Hub</em>, there is no need to indicate <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH_TYPE</strong> and <strong>ECS_ENGINE_AUTH…</strong></p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><a href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=841">WHAT IS GPT-3?</a></h2><h5>July 21st, 2020<sup></sup></h5>
<p>After playing around with the new tool from OpenAI, named GPT-3, it’s clear that we’ve probably reached an inflection point in the progress of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; To think of it in more commonplace terms, parents will often have the interesting experience of watching their children suddenly gain competency in a skill, seemingly overnight.&nbsp; There will be lots of struggle and failed starts and then as if all in one moment, boom, suddenly the kid can do something new.&nbsp; GPT-3 hails a moment when machine learning got turned on and suddenly it could do an amazing new trick, and it does this new trick with astonishing coherence and ability.&nbsp; The hope of this episode is to present a description of what GPT-3 is in layman’s terms and then explore some possible ways that this could be used, and how it might impact society.</p>


<p>But first, what is GPT?&nbsp; The acronym stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer.&nbsp; Ok sure, but what exactly is it?&nbsp; How do we interact with it?&nbsp; In simple terms <em>it’s a program that accepts some text and then generates a continuation of this text.</em>&nbsp; What exactly does this look like?&nbsp; For those with access to the GPT-3 playground through OpenAI, it just looks like an empty textbox with a submit button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now enters a principle that has emerged during the last week as developers have played around with it:</p>

<p><em>Garbage in, Garbage out.</em></p>

<p>GPT-3 mimics the style, tone and character of whatever text you feed it.&nbsp; (For those curious, you can hit the submit button with an empty textbox and GPT-3 will generate something.&nbsp; The first time I did this it started talking in French about libraries.&nbsp; The second time it started talking about heatwaves being in the headlines.)&nbsp; There is a bit of an art to the prompt you give GPT-3.&nbsp; Again, garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<p>Here are two examples:</p>


<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation: <em>A confused voice came from inside. When I opened the door, the person that looked back at me was Hayama Hayato. Why was Hayama, who I only shared memories of me playing soccer with, in my room at this hour of the night? That question immediately flew out from my mouth.</em></p>


<p>Second example, same exact input:</p>

<p>Input: What’s up?</p>

<p>GPT-3 continuation:&nbsp; <em>they respond 'Super' – at least they were back in the days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. I love the little sixties touches too, the poodle skirts, the VWs, the hippydom.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The input of “what’s up?” doesn’t provide any context, so GPT-3 generates text in a random direction each time. But notice how coherent it was…</p>

<p>But if you provide GPT-3 with context, say, the first couple paragraphs of an episode from Tinkered Thinking and it will generate a continuation of that episode which is shockingly on point and very believable.&nbsp; Episode <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=836">823</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">824</a> are non-fiction episodes that explore just this idea.&nbsp; About half of each episode was <em>generated</em> by GPT-3.&nbsp; This collaboration was also done for <a target="_blank" href="https://tinkeredthinking.com/index.php?id=837">Episode 826</a> which is a fictional short story.&nbsp; GPT-3’s contribution to that episode is not explicitly indicated but there too it wrote approximately half of the text, and that episode in particular demonstrates an aspect of context in relationship to GPT-3.&nbsp; The program’s initial contributions to the fictional short story are a bit clunky.&nbsp; But as the story goes on, GPT-3’s contributions get <em>better and better </em>as the entire context of the story grows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It should be obvious at this point that if you were to do something nefarious like input some dangerous ideas into GPT-3, then it would continue in the same vein.&nbsp; This is an important point that lends to obvious criticism and it’s a topic of which OpenAI is extremely conscious.&nbsp; The use of GPT-3 in the wild requires a security application among other safeguards to limit GPT-3’s use in obviously negative ways.&nbsp; Again, the principle holds: <em>garbage in, garbage out.&nbsp; </em>That holds not just for level of composition but of course, also subject matter.</p>

<p>Now how exactly does this magic work?&nbsp; To answer this, it’s necessary to wrap one’s mind around machine learning.&nbsp; How exactly does a machine learn?&nbsp; To be honest, nobody really knows.&nbsp; In a way, we’ve created a black box that can learn to figure things out.&nbsp; To really answer the question: how exactly does a machine learn is similar to asking: how does a person arise from all the chatter between neurons in a person’s brain?&nbsp; No one can answer that question.&nbsp; And likewise, no one can really answer the question about what’s really going on when a neural net is being trained in a machine learning context.&nbsp; That being said, we can describe some aspects of the process that help us grasp a sense of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Turns out, Machine Learning doesn’t seem too much different than human learning, though the differences are enormous and enormously important.&nbsp; Our brains are vast networks of neurons and they all talk to each other and somehow from all that chatter, we as individuals, emerge.&nbsp; To be sure, our understanding of the brain is still rudimentary, but it’s clear that neurons ‘listen’ to the chatter around them via a web of arms or dendrites that reach out to other neurons, and based on the signals they hear, they fire their own signal to be heard by another neuron or set of neurons.&nbsp; Multiply that process roughly 86 billion times, give it the right shape, and some configuration and boom, you have a human brain that will try to figure things out.&nbsp; (To dive a little deeper it’s useful to know that an infant actually has around 100 billion neurons, and as we learn how to exist in the world, we pare down this number significantly.)</p>

<p>GPT-3 was trained to generate text using a computational model that bares a lot of similarity to our jumble of neurons we call a brain.&nbsp; The analogy is so close in fact that this computational model is referred to as a ‘neural net’.&nbsp; Now here’s an interesting fact about GPT-3:&nbsp; the neural net upon which it was trained contains 175 billion parameters, or what you might think of as neurons.&nbsp; But there’s a distinction here we need to be very careful about.&nbsp; The node, or neuron, or what’s often referred to as a ‘parameter’ within this neural net is not a neuron in the same way that our neurons are.&nbsp; There is a similarity, but our neurons are vastly more complex than the nodes that exist within a neural net.&nbsp; Within the context of machine learning, a neuron is a fairly simple weighted value.&nbsp; These values dictate how one node talks to another.&nbsp; An actual human neuron is far more complex regarding how it listens and signals it’s neighbors.&nbsp; We must also take into account that there are many different types of neurons in the human brain specializing in different ways with different functions.&nbsp; Human neurons also have varying numbers of dendrites which are used to listen to other neurons.&nbsp; A single neuron can have over 100 dendrites and each dendrite has characteristics that determine how and what the core neuron hears and ultimately what sort of signal it sends.&nbsp; This presents a level of complexity that far exceeds what is going on with the nodes or neurons in a machine learning context.&nbsp; And this difference in complexity should make it intuitive why GPT-3 was trained using so many ‘neurons’.&nbsp; It’s construction and organization of these ‘neurons’ is far simpler and more straightforward than what we have going on between our ears, so where the neural net lacks in terms of shape and initial configuration, it attempts to make up for in size and the brute force achieved by speed and computational iteration.</p>

<p>So how does a neural net learn in order for something like GPT-3 to work?&nbsp; First you need a gargantuan amount of data.&nbsp; GPT-3 was trained using text from the internet - an amount of text that is just inconceivable for a single human being to think about reading.&nbsp; Think of every comment, every post, every description, every pdf book freely available, all the tweets and blogs, manuals, dissertations, threads, rantings - all of it.&nbsp; That was the block of text that was given to the neural net for it’s training. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how does that training work?&nbsp; Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and asked you to guess what that word is.&nbsp; As a human, you’d probably do really well at this.&nbsp; You’d certainly do a perfect job guessing a <em>sensible</em> word that fits the context and which works, regardless of whether you guess the actual word. Here’s a tiny example:&nbsp; Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this ___________ . &nbsp;</p>

<p>The above example is easy.&nbsp; The word is ‘sentence’.&nbsp; But.&nbsp; Since I’ve started a new paragraph, you could also plop the word ‘paragraph’ into the slot and it still works.&nbsp; This is the task that GPT-3 has become remarkably good at:&nbsp; <em>what word would make sense to come next?&nbsp; </em>The training of the neural net essentially asked this question of itself over and over.&nbsp; We can imagine the neural net reading 99 words and guessing what the 100th word would be.&nbsp; It would then check the answer and see how far ‘off’ the answer was, and based on the difference it would backtrack through the neural net to find all of the nodes that were most responsible for the choice of the wrong word, and then it would adjust the weights of those nodes, which in turn effects how those nodes will talk to one another in the next round.&nbsp; Run this game an astronomical number of times with an inconceivably large amount of text and after a while the neural net gets pretty good at the game it’s playing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s important to note is that the computer is not actually ‘reading’ the text that’s given to it.&nbsp; The computer first creates embeddings for this block of text.&nbsp; What is an embedding?&nbsp; It’s arbitrary, but it’s a form that the computer can actually work with.&nbsp; Computers function using binary code.&nbsp; Each letter that you read on a website is actually derived from a binary code.&nbsp; So embeddings are bits of binary code that are associated with the words and word-snippets that the computer ‘reads’.&nbsp; These embeddings …</p></div></div>

<h2>Abstract</h2><p>RISC-V has many attractions, ranging from the openness of the architecture, its clean-slate design based on simplicity and scalability, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commitment to security from the ground up.

As such, RISC-V is an extremely attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivalled verification and security story. This has led industry players, especially Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber, making a major bet on the combination of RISC-V and seL4, resulting in them funding the formal verification (implementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.

I will discuss our experience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture, and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to build secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that supports a security-by-architecture approach, and the Cogent systems language that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as file systems and device drivers. 

One interesting aspect are timing channels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*, the temporal equivalent of memory protection, as a systematic timing-channel prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to get this right, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms into the processor specification.

My restaurant had been taking precautions since February. Extra hand-wash and hand-sanitizer stations were installed and cleaning guidelines in English and Spanish posted in the kitchen. We gave all the pens nightly bleach baths, among other intensified cleaning protocols. Our managers told us to stay home if we were feeling literally the slightest bit sick, “unless you’re hungover,” they clarified lovingly.</p><p id="viewer-74a2l">
I washed my hands before and after I interacted with a guest in any way whatsoever : before I picked up silverware to mark the next course, before and after I touched clean or dirty dishes or had to squeeze through a crowd to reach the service bar. I tried not to count how many hundreds of people I interacted with in the course of my job, beyond the guests I was officially responsible for in my forty-person capacity section that I turned at least twice a shift. </p><p id="viewer-95ie2">
Guests would still sneeze and cough into our faces while we interacted with them, merrily tipping a wad of snot-soaked tissues into the olive oil ramekin for us to dispose of — a behavior that long predates and unfortunately I doubt will cease post-pandemic. It happened so often in those last weeks despite the increasing threat of infection that our general manager permitted us to wear gloves disposing of their used tissues in front of them: a desperate attempt to genteelly shame them into caring about our health too. </p><div id="viewer-cs09k"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.noraeberman.com/post/i-m-an-unemployed-waitress-don-t-dine-out-at-all" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1056,h_702,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fbc3b8_7ffddcf5f7c649a5a95b9de8e38e937a~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-vtrm">
The majority of guests are not this thoughtless, and I promise I will keep the server rants to a minimum.

While it is significantly more likely to contract coronavirus <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-higher-tight-indoor-spaces-with-little-air-flow-2020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indoors</a>, even outdoor dining presents a context filled with possibilities for transmission. Alcohol inhibits social distancing and mask wearing, as does the consumption of food. Shouting specials and orders over a crowded table projects a spray of particles from the waitstaff and guests’ mouths, as does laughing, singing, and <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/can-you-get-coronavirus-from-talking-to-someone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking loudly</a> — all things common to any restaurant or bar. Even to-go service poses risks, with over-intoxication leading customers to congregate or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/dining/restaurant-risks-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harass the staff</a> when they’re asked to wear a mask and keep socially distant.</p><p id="viewer-ag6f7">
When a <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/06/01/asymptomatic-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly asymptomatic</a> customer decides to indulge that craving for frosé or enchiladas during a pandemic, they are asking largely uninsured restaurant staff to depend on two things to protect themselves. The first is their employer(s), who are in an existential fight for their survival, in an <a href="https://time.com/5658442/tipped-restaurant-workers-american-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry</a> where “normal” involves razor-thin margins and working without benefits or paid sick leave. The second is the customer. A tipped employee’s financial well-being is directly tied to their ability to connect with and serve strangers. Right now those strangers are our fellow Americans, who to say the absolute <em>least</em> are currently a mixed bag in their observance of mask, isolation, and social-distancing etiquette.</p><p id="viewer-5bsq0">
In talking to former coworkers and friends who have returned to work in restaurants across New York City and the country in recent weeks, nothing I have heard inspires confidence. It’s hard to not feel like our lives are valued less than that perfect martini our guests have been missing as they work safely from home. </p><p id="viewer-3lgf7">
We’re all scared. Many of us are artists or freelancers whose other sources of income from creative fields like the performing arts and film have also vanished. My husband and I calculate almost daily how long we can afford to stay in our home. Until September? October? At night I lie awake consumed with worry about all of my undocumented and otherwise marginalized coworkers. Latinx people alone make up 26.8% of the food &amp; beverage industry according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 figures</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and they are more than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as likely to die of COVID-19</a> than white Americans like myself. </p><p id="viewer-8jenh">
Those of us that make a living in this industry do not deserve to be <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-economic-advisor-hassett-human-capital-stock-1004909/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“human capital stock”</a> sacrificed on the altar of denial, when the inherent nature of what we do is a proven driver of transmission, infection, and ultimately prolonged economic devastation. From Beejhy Barhany, owner of <a href="https://tsioncafe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tsion</a> (a delicious Ethiopian-Mediterranean spot in Harlem) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9pjaXes1LQ&amp;fbclid=IwAR2n6XJdvcZyJ1gTbjTtf9q0MSUVjM0PFg-eFBJDvRmLssvimHm3ERGVFvA&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleading</a> for assistance to the GoFundMe for my dear lesbian dive bar, restaurant owners across the city and the country are desperate for sustained, long-term federal aid.</p><p id="viewer-90v6v">
Support from our former patrons is crucial. We need you to order take-out or delivery directly from the restaurants if you are privileged enough to do so. If you can afford this, you can also afford to tip that essential worker who delivers your food 35%. I guarantee they need it.</p><p id="viewer-cjvgg">
Call your representatives to continue Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) through the end of 2020. Pressure them to bail out the restaurant industry made up largely of small businesses the way they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/business/small-businesses-ppp-loans-chain-restaurants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bailed out massive chains like Shake Shack</a> in 2020 and big banks in 2009. Demand federal legislation that protects tipped employees who largely work for below minimum wage with no benefits. </p><p id="viewer-ci0vm">
Potential quarantine-fatigued or asymptomatic guests are not the solution to our survival but rather will unintentionally ensure the continued exploitation of the most vulnerable amongst us. Restaurants and bars are the quintessential small business. They exist to nourish their community both physically and socially, and when done well, the result is magic. I know, because I miss it too.</p><p id="viewer-dac6j">

<p>Ion was built to address rapid development, decoupling, and efficiency
challenges faced every day while engineering large-scale, service-oriented
architectures. It has been addressing these challenges within Amazon for nearly
a decade, and we believe others will benefit as well.</p>

<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>

<p>All JSON values are valid Ion values, and while any value can be encoded in JSON (e.g., a timestamp value can be converted to a string), such approaches require extra effort, obscure the actual type of the data, and tend to be error-prone.</p>

<p>In contrast, Ion’s rich type system enables unambiguous semantics for data (e.g., a timestamp value can be encoded using the timestamp type).  The following illustrates some of the features of the Ion type system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>timestamp:</strong>  arbitrary precision date / timestamps
    <div><div><pre><code>2003-12-01T
2010-03-22T18:00:00Z
2019-05-01T18:12:53.472-0800
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>int:</strong>  arbitrary size integers
    <div><div><pre><code>0
-1
12345678901234567890...
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>decimal:</strong>  arbitrary precision, base-10 encoded real numbers
    <div><div><pre><code>0.
-1.2
3.141592653589793238...
6.62607015d-34
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>float:</strong>  32-/64-bit IEEE-754 floating-point values
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>symbol:</strong>  provides efficient encoding for frequently occurring strings
    <div><div><pre><code>inches
dollars
'high-priority'    // symbols with special characters ('-' in this example)
                   // are enclosed in single-quotes
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>blob:</strong>  binary data
    
  </li>
  <li><strong>annotation:</strong>  metadata associated with a value
    <div><div><pre><code>dollars::100.0
height::inches::72
lotto_numbers::[7, 9, 19, 40, 42, 44]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/docs/spec.html">Specification</a> provides an overview of the full set of Ion types.</p>

<h3 id="binary-encoding">Binary Encoding</h3>

<p>Ion provides two encodings:  human-readable text (as shown above), and a space- and read-efficient binary encoding.  When binary-encoded, every Ion value is prefixed with the value’s type and length.  The following illustrates a few of the efficiences provided by Ion’s binary encoding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The following timestamp encoded as a JSON string requires 26 bytes:  “2017-07-26T16:30:04.076Z”.  This timestamp requires just 11 bytes when encoded in Ion binary:
    <div><div><pre><code>6a 80 0f e1 87 9a 90 9e 84 c3 4c
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>That first byte <code>6a</code> indicates the value is a timestamp (type <code>6</code>) represented by the subsequent 10 bytes (that’s what the <code>a</code> represents).  If this particular timestamp value is not of interest, a reader can jump over the value by skipping 10 bytes.  This ability to skip over a value enables faster navigation over Ion data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Binary encoding of a symbol replaces the text of a symbol with an integer that can be resolved to the original text via a symbol table.  This can result in substantial space savings for symbols that occur frequently!</p>
  </li>
  <li>While blob data is base-64 encoded in text (which produces 4 bytes for every 3 bytes of the original data), a blob encoded as Ion binary is simply encoded as is—no base-64 expansion required!</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar space efficiencies are found in other aspects of Ion’s binary encoding.</p>

<h3 id="give-ion-a-try">Give Ion a Try!</h3>

<p>
/* Ion supports comments. */
// Here is a struct, which is similar to a JSON object
{
  // Field names don't always have to be quoted
  name: "Fido",

  // This is an integer with a 'years' annotation
  age: years::4,

  // This is a timestamp with day precision
  birthday: 2012-03-01T,

  // Here is a list, which is like a JSON array
  toys: [
    // These are symbol values, which are like strings,
    // but get encoded as integers in binary
    ball,
    rope,
  ],

  // This is a decimal -- a base-10 floating point value
  weight: pounds::41.2,

  // Here is a blob -- binary data, which is
  // base64-encoded in Ion text encoding

"This bloodshed must end — this bloodshed will end," he said.</p>  <p>The program involves deploying federal law enforcement agents to assist local police in combating what the Justice Department has described as a "surge" of violent crime.</p>  <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New Mexico Gov.&nbsp;Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, welcomed the federal help, so long as it was to assist local law enforcement with community policing and public safety. Both rejected the use of federal agents for the kind of protest crackdown seen in Portland, Ore., saying such actions would be met with legal action.</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en"><p>The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NewMexicoOAG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NewMexicoOAG&lt;/a&gt; and I will actively monitor for potential civil rights violations if and when the federal government sends officers to our state. We would welcome a genuine conversation about community public safety work and fighting violent crime.

"We will continue to confront mob violence. But the operations we are discussing today are very different — they are classic crime fighting."</p>  <p>Trump hopes his "law and order" push will resonate with his political base as he trails Democrat Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. But the initiative risks inflaming tensions running high in many cities in the wake of the death in police custody of George Floyd, a Black man.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5659437.1595454018!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/aptopix-racial-injustice-portland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>U.S. federal officers use chemical irritants and crowd control munitions to disperse Black Lives Matter protesters outside the Mark O.

        <div>
          <p>Biff</p>
          <p>A web framework + self-hosted deployment solution for Clojure</p>
        </div>
        
<p>Biff is designed to make web development with Clojure fast and easy, especially
for early stage startups and hobby projects. Over time I'd like to make it
suitable for apps that need scale as well.
I use it in production for <a href="https://findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka</a>, my startup. I started writing Biff after 18 months
of experimenting with various web technologies like Firebase, Datomic and
several Clojure web frameworks/libraries. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Installation and deployment</strong> on DigitalOcean (or other VPS).</li>
<li><strong>Crux</strong> (an immutable document database with Datalog queries).</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>. Specify what data the frontend needs declaratively, and
Biff will keep it up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Read/write authorization rules</strong>. No need to set up a bunch of endpoints
for CRUD operations. Queries and transactions can be submitted from the
frontend as long as they pass the rules you define.</li>
<li><strong>Database triggers</strong>. Run code when documents of certain types are created,
updated or deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>. Email link for now; password and SSO coming later.</li>
<li><strong>Websocket communication</strong>.</li>
<li>Serving <strong>static resources</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Multitenancy</strong>. Run multiple apps from the same process.</li>
<li>Less than <strong>2K lines of code</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also: instead of trying to do everything for everyone, Biff is designed to be
easy to take apart (without forking). This should help mitigate the main
drawback of frameworks, which is that it's often less work in the long run to
just stitch the libraries together yourself.</p>

<p>Biff is currently alpha quality. Join <code>#biff</code> on <a href="http://clojurians.net/" target="_blank">Clojurians Slack</a> for
discussion. Feel free to reach out for help, bug reports or anything else. Also
see the issues and source on the <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff" target="_blank">Github
repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-firebase">Comparison to Firebase</h2>
<p>Basically, if you like Firebase and you like Clojure backend dev, you might
enjoy using Biff for your next side project. Same if you like the idea of
Firebase but in practice you have issues with it. If you want something mature
or you like having a Node/ClojureScript backend, Firebase is a great choice. <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/mystery-cows" target="_blank">Here's a non-trivial
example</a> of using Firebase with ClojureScript.</p>

<p>Some shared features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Natural modeling of graph data</li>
<li>Basic query subscriptions (no joins)</li>
<li>Client-side transactions</li>
<li>Authorization rules</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Authentication built-in</li>
</ul>

<p>Some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biff has a long-running JVM/Clojure backend instead of an ephemeral
Node/ClojureScript backend =&gt; better library ecosystem IMO and lower response
times/no cold start.</li>
<li>Firebase has way more features and is vastly more mature.</li>
<li>Biff is open-source + self-hosted =&gt; you have total control. If there's anything you don't like, you can fix it.</li>
<li><a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> (the database Biff uses) is immutable and has Datalog queries.</li>
<li>Authorization rules in Firebase are IMO error-prone and hard to debug.</li>
<li>Firebase supports password and SSO authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fastest way to get started with Biff is by cloning the Github repo and running the
official example project (an implementation of Tic Tac Toe):</p>

<ol>
<li>Install dependencies: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">Clojure</a>,
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm" target="_blank">NPM</a> and
(optionally) <a href="https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind#installation" target="_blank">Overmind</a>.</li>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff</code></li>
<li><code>cd biff/example</code></li>
<li><code>./task setup</code></li>
<li><code>./task dev</code></li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:9630</code> and start the <code>app</code> build.</li>
<li>Go to <code>localhost:8080</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you're on Windows/don't have Bash, you'll need to run the
commands inside <code>task</code> individually (translated to whatever shell you're
using). Also, you may need to install
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145" target="_blank">this package</a>
(see <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/2531" target="_blank">facebook/rocksdb#2531</a>).</p>

<p>You can tinker with this app and use it as a template for your own projects. See
<a href="#production">Production</a> when you want to deploy.</p>

<p>The example project uses tools.deps, Shadow CLJS, and Overmind.
<code>task</code> is the main entrypoint:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>

setup <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  which clj npm <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null <span># Assert dependencies</span>
  npm <span>install</span> <span># Or `npm init; npm install --save-dev shadow-cljs; npm install --save react react-dom`</span>
  clj <span>-Sresolve-tags</span>
<span>}</span>

repl <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
<span>}</span>

cljs <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  npx shadow-cljs server
<span>}</span>

dev <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span># Download dependencies first. This prevents clj and shadow-cljs from trying</span>
  <span># to clone new git dependencies at the same time which causes an error.</span>
  clojure <span>-Spath</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
  <span>if </span>which overmind <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <span>;</span> <span>then
    </span>overmind start
  <span>else
    </span>cljs &amp;
    repl
  <span>fi</span>
<span>}</span>

...

<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>repl: ./task repl
cljs: ./task cljs
</code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>./task dev</code> will run <code>./task repl</code> and <code>./task cljs</code> in the same terminal
window. Hit <code>ctrl-c</code> to exit. If you'd like to restart just one process and you
have Overmind installed, run e.g. <code>overmind restart repl</code> in another window.
You can easily add new build tasks by creating new functions in <code>task</code>. Also, I
recommend putting <code>alias t='./task'</code> in your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>To fetch the latest Biff version, start out with only <code>:git/url</code> and <code>:tag</code> in the dependency:</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>
 </span><span>:deps</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>github-jacobobryant/biff</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:git/url</span><span> </span><span>"https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff"</span><span>
   </span><span>:tag</span><span> </span><span>"HEAD"</span><span>}}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then run <code>clj -Sresolve-tags</code>. The latest commit hash will be added to <code>deps.edn</code>.</p>

<p>When you run <code>clj -m biff.core</code>, Biff searches the classpath for plugins and then starts
them in a certain order. To define a plugin, you must set <code>^:biff</code> metadata on a namespace
and then set a <code>components</code> var to a list of plugin objects in that namespace:</p>

    </span><span>:start</span><span> </span><span>start-example</span><span>}])</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>:biff/init</code> and <code>:biff/web-server</code> are plugins defined in the <code>biff.core</code>
namespace. The <code>:requires</code> and <code>:required-by</code> values are used to start plugins
in the right order. You can think of plugins kind of like Ring middleware. They
receive a system map and pass along a modified version of it.</p>

<p><code>biff.system/start-biff</code> starts a Biff app. That includes initializing:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Crux node</li>
<li>a Sente websocket listener and event router</li>
<li>some default event handlers that handle queries, transactions and subscriptions from the frontend</li>
<li>a Crux transaction listener, so clients can be notified of subscription updates</li>
<li>some Reitit HTTP routes for authentication</li>
<li>any static resources you've included with your app</li>
</ul>

<p>If you connect to nrepl port 7888, you can access the system with
<code>@biff.core/system</code>. Biff provides some helper functions for repl-driven
development:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>biff.core/stop</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/start</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>biff.core/refresh</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>; stops, reloads namespaces from filesystem, starts.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>App-specific configuration can go in your plugin, as shown above. For example, we set
<code>:example.biff.auth/on-signin</code> so that clients will be redirected to <code>/app/</code> after they
sign in successfully.</p>

<p>Environment-specific configuration and secrets can go in <code>config.edn</code>. They will be read in
by the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin.</p>


<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>:prod</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>; If you set jdbc credentials, remove this file from source control!</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/dbname</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/user</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/password</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/host</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>
        </span><span>:biff.crux.jdbc/port</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>
        </span><span>:example.mailgun/api-key</span><span> </span><span>"..."</span><span>}</span><span>
 </span><span>:dev</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:inherit</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:prod</span><span>]</span><span>
       </span><span>:biff/dev</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
       </span><span>:example.biff/host</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>}}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The system map is mostly flat, with namespaced keys. For example, Biff
configuration for the example app is stored under the <code>:example.biff</code> namespace.
You could run multiple Biff apps in the same process by using a different
namespace, e.g. <code>(biff.system/start-biff sys 'another-app)</code>. Keys under
the <code>:biff</code> namespace (e.g. <code>:biff/dev</code> from <code>config.edn</code> above) will become
defaults for all Biff apps.</p>

<p>Similarly, the return values from <code>biff.system/start-biff</code> will be namespaced. For example,
you can get the Crux node in our example app with <code>(:example.biff/node @biff.core/system)</code>.</p>

<p>When the <code>:biff/init</code> plugin reads in your <code>config.edn</code> file, it will merge the
nested maps according to the current environment and the value of <code>:inherit</code>.
The default environment is <code>:prod</code>. This can be overridden by setting the
<code>BIFF_ENV</code> environment variable:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>BIFF_ENV</span><span>=</span>dev clj <span>-m</span> biff.core
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here is a complete list of configuration options and their default values. See the following sections
for a deeper explanation.</p>

<p>Note: <code>:foo/*</code> is used to denote all keywords prefixed by <code>:foo/</code> or <code>:foo.</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>; === Config for the :biff/init plugin ===</span><span>

			<p>As universities are switching to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-pandemic-rages-prominent-colleges-announce-online-semesters-11594130062">100% remote teaching in the coming semester</a>, many undergraduate students should strongly consider getting a “DIY” CS degree: take the same courses you would at your own school, but on any one of the online Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms, like <a href="https://coursera.org/">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://edx.org/">edX</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: this one is a no-brainer. According to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic">US News</a> one year of college tuition costs $10,116 on average for in-state students at a public school, and $36,801 on average at private schools.</p>
<p>Compare this with just a few hundred dollars for taking the equivalent MOOCs.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the money - you just saved yourself a decade of paying off student debt. If you do have the money - congrats! Put it in an investment account and use it as seed money for your first startup company!</p>
<p><strong>Better teaching</strong>: MOOCs are now freely available from the very best schools and world class professors, even if you didn’t get into Stanford or Harvard.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p><strong>No face time</strong>: you will be getting little to no live, personal time with the professors and TAs. This is somewhat mitigated by the TAs actively participating in the online forums the most MOOC platforms have, but still - not the same.</p>
<p><strong>No community</strong>: this one is the biggest one IMO. You don’t have the experience of learning together with your peers. MOOC platforms do have forums and group projects and it’s likely those features will continue to evolve and improve.</p>
<p><strong>No college life</strong>: you will be missing on the college experience. This one is a big one. However, with the current uncertainty around COVID19 - there’s no telling how many semesters you’ll be missing out on <em>anyway</em>, so you might end up not missing as much.</p>
<p><strong>No structure</strong>: you will have to be very disciplined. There will be no structure of “being at school”. You’ll need to get your butt out of bed and do the work, by yourself, at home.</p>
<p><strong>Existing investment</strong>: if you’re a junior or senior, you’ve already invested time, effort and money into your degree. Switching to self-directed online learning will nullify that.</p>
<p><strong>No degree</strong>: at the end of it all you’re not getting a degree. Those still matter to many but I believe it matters less over time. If you invest effort into creating a viable curriculum, doing all the work and getting the certificates, and documenting everything - you’ll end up with a very impressive “DIY degree”.</p>
<p>As a hiring manager, if I saw this on a resume (I haven’t yet) - I would be very impressed.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>There is lots of room and value in creating an online learning “community” where students will be able to engage with peers and teachers in a live, face-to-face manner. This functionality will continue to improve on the existing MOOC platforms, but can also exist as a third party product.</p>
<p>Another missing feature that should exist is pre-built degree curriculums for different majors, linking out to all the available (and recommended or “best”) MOOCs for each subject.</p>

<p><span>E</span>arlier this year, when Facebook reached a $52 million settlement with lawyers representing more than 10,000 former and current content moderators in four U.S. states, their colleagues in India and the Philippines were entirely left out.</p>



<p>In their case against Facebook, workers in the United States had claimed that examining content on the social media giant’s platform, which can include screening for everything from child pornography to videos of terrorist decapitations, had led to severe psychological <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">consequences</a>. And like their American colleagues, Asian workers, thousands of whom are employed as content moderators by outsourcing firms like Genpact and Cognizant, have been reporting<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-human-toll-of-protecting-the-internet-from-the-worst-of-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> grueling working conditions</a> that<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/inside-the-world-of-india-s-content-mods-11584543074609.html"> expose them to a stream</a> of violent, graphic content, leaving some of them with lasting mental scars.</p>



<p>Facebook <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/08/1002894/facebook-needs-30000-of-its-own-content-moderators-says-a-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employs more than 15,000</a> content moderators globally. While the lawsuit provided relief for some moderators in the U.S., it did not address the plight of those who worked for the company abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the U.S., people can speak up for their rights,” one former content moderator, a 25-year-old man in India who requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But it’s not the same here.”</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/facebook-myanmar-scale/">The trouble with scale: why not all growth is good</a></strong></p>



<p>The outsourcing boom began in India and the Philippines in the late 1980s and 1990s, when Western technology companies began offloading back-office functions like customer service or IT to countries with well-educated but considerably cheaper workforces. Today, business process outsourcing (BPO) companies employ more than 1.2 million people in the Philippines and more than <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/the-transformation-of-indias-bpo-industry-1776399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.1 million</a> in India. When Facebook began outsourcing its moderation efforts in the late aughts, the two countries <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-philippines-economy-20150202-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established themselves</a> as hubs for BPO, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/world/asia/29iht-letter29.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most notably</a> call center work.</p>



<p>Unlike U.S.-based moderators, for whom the job is often temporary, many Indian and Filipino moderators consider BPO work a career path unto itself. These jobs, often performed by workers who are educated and English proficient but not particularly well-off, can function as a springboard to the middle class. Without these foreign workers, Facebook would be inundated with the type of violent content that would eventually drive users and advertisers away.</p>



<p>“Given the centrality of content moderation, it’s not natural to outsource it,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University. “It makes it somewhat problematic right from the start because the function is that important.”</p>



<p>Rahul, a 30-year-old man in Hyderabad, India, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his identity,&nbsp;joined Genpact after working in customer services at a bank for several years. The starting salary was good, close to $500 a month (now it’s closer to $200), and he found the opportunity to work on-site at Facebook alluring.</p>



<p>When Rahul arrived at the company’s Hyderabad office, he marveled at its plush couches, Ping-Pong tables, and meals catered by the best restaurants in the city. Rahul hadn’t seen anything like it before. The chance to tell his friends that he worked in Hitech City, a campus for some of the most notable international tech companies, seemed too good to pass up. “It was 60% of why I took the job,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rafael, a Filipino man who spoke to <em>Rest of World </em>on the condition that he be identified by a pseudonym to protect his identity, said that he took on content moderation work to advance his career. A former journalism student who enjoyed writing, he was happy to exercise his creativity by writing blog posts for some of his firm’s other clients, in addition to his moderation work.</p>



<p>Even when the work proved trying, he focused on the potential for professional growth. “To enrich my portfolio, I stuck with it for some time,” Rafael said. He also noted that as soon as he saw an opportunity to leave content moderation and take a new job, two years into the position, he “jumped on it.”</p>



<p>Daniel Charest, a Dallas-based attorney, represented some of the moderators in the U.S. suit. His success, he said, stemmed largely from the ability to discuss the psychological harm done by the work to his clients, who were diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety by psychological professionals, in court. But in countries like India and the Philippines, social stigmas and a lack of mental health access often stand in the way of speaking openly about psychological issues, not to mention getting diagnoses in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rafael felt comfortable and even confident moderating everything from hate speech to pornography. But it was a graphic video of a child being abused that stuck with him. After seeing the video, he began to notice a change in his own behavior that worried him. “I am not a bad person,” he told <em>Rest of World. </em>“But I’d find myself doing little diabolical things, saying things I would regret. Thinking things I didn’t want to.”</p>



<p>At the time, the company he worked for did not offer its moderators any sort of in-house counseling. So he paid for therapy, using his own money. When asked if he believed companies like Facebook should be responsible for bearing these types of costs on behalf of moderators, Rafael said he had signed a nondisclosure agreement with his current company, preventing him from answering such a question.</p>



<p>“Sometimes the despair and darkness of people will get to you, even if you say, ‘Oh, I’m a professional, I can handle that,’” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his first few weeks on the job, Rahul felt shocked by the graphic videos he encountered of car crashes and child abuse. Eventually, he grew desensitized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It gets to a point where you can eat your lunch while watching a video of someone dying. … But at the end of the day, you still have to be human.” Rahul said he didn’t see a therapist — it wouldn’t have been useful to him, he said.</p>



<p>Rahul’s experience of desensitization mirrors that of other moderators, one former counselor who worked with Genpact and requested anonymity, told <em>Rest of World</em>. When moderators finally did seek treatment — often when content would remind them of events in their personal lives — they were surprised to be affected. According to the former counselor, “They’d say, ‘I’ve been doing this for so long. Why am I feeling this now?’”</p>



<p>According to Dr. K. Jyothirmayi, a Hyderabad-based psychiatrist, stigmas, such as the perceived impact of a mental health diagnosis on one’s marital prospects, often prevent young Indians from seeking treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Philippines has comparatively <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/205425-duterte-signs-mental-health-law-services-philippines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive mental health legislation</a>, but barriers and stigmas persist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issues ranging from Manila’s notorious traffic to the prohibitive costs of mental health care, may make treatment unattainable to the average Filipino BPO worker, according to Lawrence Wang, founder of MyGolana, Inc., a U.S.-based online counseling startup that works in the Philippines.</p>



<p>While Rafael had to seek private counseling, some BPO firms do offer this service in-house in the Philippines, though even that can be outsourced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mariel, who also asked that she be identified by a pseudonym because she is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, worked as a hotline counselor at a BPO company. Her clients were employees at other BPO companies, including content moderators for Facebook. Because the sessions took place over the phone, Mariel was not able to offer psychological diagnoses.</p>



<p>Over the course of her two years with the company, Mariel had several clients who began to contemplate suicide after moderating suicide-related content. Callers who expressed suicidal thoughts or tendencies were flagged to the firm handling content moderation and referred to an in-person counselor. But, she said, there were no such protocols for moderators experiencing other issues, such as anxiety, depression, or sleep deprivation, that might alert the company to brewing mental health crises.</p>

<p>“The deep seething thought will haunt you; it will creep you out,” Rafael said. “It’s impossible that it wouldn’t, because I saw it; it’s already recorded in my mind.” Rafael attributes his ability to recover from seeing the video to therapy.</p>



<p>“I feel like, if I had not consulted a specialist back then, it [the feeling of being haunted by the video] would have manifested in some form that I would have regretted later on.”</p>



<p>Even if moderators did receive in-person counseling, they would run into inhospitable legal climates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, workers’ compensation lawsuits are adjudicated through various&nbsp;laws, but the country’s legal framework does not consider mental health an occupational hazard. “Indian labor law frameworks were designed with factories in mind,” Ayush Rathi, a researcher with India’s Centre for Internet &amp; Society, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Geetha Devarajan, a labor lawyer and consultant to the Forum for IT Employees, a trade union for IT and BPO workers, said Indian content moderators might file a lawsuit under the country’s Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. But before filing a lawsuit under the act, moderators would have to be unionized and enter arbitration with their employers in order to try to reach an acceptable compromise.</p>



<p>Though labor laws in the Philippines generally state that third-party companies share responsibility for employees working for a contracting firm, <a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/outsourcing-laws-and-regulations/philippines">those regulations do not apply to the BPO industry</a> — which allows third-party companies that outsource work to BPO firms to avoid responsibility for the employees who do that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The entire legal system in the Philippines is designed to attract foreign investment into industries like business process outsourcing,” said Alden Sajor Marte-Wood, an assistant professor at …</p></div></div>

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
We present a real-time approach for multi-person 3D motion capture at over 30 fps using a single RGB camera. It operates successfully in generic scenes which may contain occlusions by objects and by other people. Our method operates in subsequent stages. The first stage is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that estimates 2D and 3D pose features along with identity assignments for all visible joints of all individuals.We contribute a new architecture for this CNN, called SelecSLS Net, that uses novel selective long and short range skip connections to improve the information flow allowing for a drastically faster network without compromising accuracy. In the second stage, a fully connected neural network turns the possibly partial (on account of occlusion) 2Dpose and 3Dpose features for each subject into a complete 3Dpose estimate per individual. The third stage applies space-time skeletal model fitting to the predicted 2D and 3D pose per subject to further reconcile the 2D and 3D pose, and enforce temporal coherence. Our method returns the full skeletal pose in joint angles for each subject. This is a further key distinction from previous work that do not produce joint angle results of a coherent skeleton in real time for multi-person scenes. The proposed system runs on consumer hardware at a previously unseen speed of more than 30 fps given 512x320 images as input while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, which we will demonstrate on a range of challenging real-world scenes.

        <p>The following is the result of my junkyard-wars attempt to throw together a terminal server solution in the continued pursuit of zero-touch provisioning and administration of my home linux systems.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-wanted-remote-console-access">Why I wanted remote console access</h2>
<p>I run a number of services in my home covering all the essentials such as media serving, DNS, local cloud, PBX, Minecraft containers, etc.  This started out years ago from a single Mac Mini, but has grown over time to consist of two redundant headless PCs.  Having two systems rather than one has been critical for uptime as my family has become more dependent on these services.  Embracing IaC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a>) through tools like Ansible has helped tremendously;  particularly with the reality of a home network where I can’t just drop other responsibilities to put on my sysadmin dad cap (or <a href="https://getfedora.org/">fedora</a> in my case).</p>
<p>Having this redundancy has helped, but more than a few times I have gotten into a situation where I have attempted to preform a system update on one of the pair remotely from cafe or sofa and the PC failed to come back up after a reboot.  Often this was due to DKMS mods that didn’t work on a new kernel version or things of that nature.  I would have to either give up on it until I had time to get physical access (get off the sofa) or beg one of my kids to act as remote hands.  These are PCs and they don’t have any iLO, LOM, or DRAC built in.  I could not justify the cost of upgrading to server-grade motherboards.  I needed something that would give me remote console access to these systems on the cheap.  I spotted a Raspberry Pi collecting dust in the corner of my office and started to have some ideas.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/grub_screen.png" alt="retro term grub screen"></p><h2 id="serial-hardware">Serial hardware</h2>
<p>It has been a while, but I have great memories of pinning out custom serial cables.  Spending hours in the blissful white-noise hum of the data center with my trusty RS-232 breakout box (das blinkenlights), occasionally an oscilloscope if things got really desperate, and a huge box of almost every conceivable serial adaptor and null modem, but almost never the one you need.  I even impressed my wife (gf at that time) back then by turning a box of spare shiny silver RJ45-DB9 adaptors into ornaments for our first Christmas tree.  At least, I think she was impressed.  Yes, of course she was impressed.  That was the coolest tree in all of New York that year.  The way the lights reflected off the silver Sun Microsystems logos really captured the holiday spirit.  But I digress.  I no longer have that box of serial adaptors and my wife somehow can’t remember where it went since we got maried.  So, off to Amazon I went.</p>
<p>My PCs didn’t have serial ports on the back, though a quick look under the hood showed that both had COM1 headers.  I just needed to get backplates for access.  But, these these are pretty cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001Y1F0HW</a></p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.lasseter.org/img/serial_orders.png" alt="adaptor and backplate"></p><h2 id="cable-runs">Cable runs</h2>
<p>Now that my PCs had serial ports, I needed to decide how to connect to them.  My idea was to use a Raspberry Pi as a terminal server and connect to the two serial ports of the PCs using USB-DB9 RS-232 adaptors,  But, before getting the RaPi involved I would just connect the servers to each other in the same fashion. I wanted to have some flexibility with what cables I used in case I changed how far apart the PCs sat, so I opted for a cableless adaptor that I could plug a USB cable extender into of whatever length I needed.  I already had spare extenders, so this worked out great.  I found these adaptors came in two varieties: PL2303 and FTDI.  I checked reviews long enough to find evidence of Linux users using the FTDI kind with success and went with that one.  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B0769G9HK4</a></p>
<h2 id="bios-changes">BIOS changes</h2>
<p>On each PC, I booted into BIOS and confirmed COM1 was enabled.  Both had the ability to turn it off, but they were both on by default, so no change needed.  While I was in there I also looked for the BIOS settings to auto-power-on after power-loss and set those so that I would not have to press a button to start them up when power returned.  Now with both systems running again and each connected to the other via USB to serial, I was done with the hardware side of the project (aside from the RaPi addition to come).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-io">Configuring IO</h2>
<p>I run CentOS on my servers.  If you use this post as a guide, do keep that in mind.  The following software configuration is likely to be different outside of the RHEL/CentOS/Fedora family.</p>
<h3 id="giving-the-serial-port-access-to-login">Giving the serial port access to login</h3>
<p>getty is the program that listens for terminal connections and provides login access to a given terminal.  Here I enabled and started the service for COM1 (ttyS0).  Without this, the remote serial user would never be prompted to log in.</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now serial-getty@ttyS0.service</code></p>
<h3 id="grub-setup">Grub setup</h3>
<p>I needed to configure grub2 to use the serial port for input and output, otherwise I would not be able to interact with grub on a reboot.  An example is escaping the boot process at the grub menu in order to boot into recovery mode or to simply boot from the last known working kernel.  To achieve this, I made these changes to /etc/default/grub:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT and GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT to <code>serial</code>.</li>
<li>Set GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND with the appropriate speed of 115200.</li>
<li>Added <code>console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial</code> to the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX so the kernel would also use the serial port.</li>
<li>Removed both <code>rhgb</code> and <code>quiet</code> from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in order to have verbose output of the boot status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my grub config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># /etc/default/grub</span>
<span>GRUB_TIMEOUT</span><span>=</span><span>5</span>

You would need to check on your setup, but for recent RHEL/CentOS/Fedora systems, that would be <code>/boot/grub2/grub.cfg</code> for MBR or <code>/boot/efi/EFI/&lt;distro&gt;/grub.cfg</code> for EFI.</p>
<h2 id="console-session-management">Console session management</h2>
<p>There are a number of different tools you could use to access the terminal, such as <code>screen</code>, <code>minicom</code>, or <code>tip</code>, but I want something that will manage the connection fully as a daemon and keep logs of the output for my review.  That is important because sometimes when a system runs into trouble, it may be able to log clues to the console even when permanent storage is not available at that moment.  There is a fantastic program called <code>conserver</code> that does all that and more.  You can define connections, whether they be local or over ssh.  It can facilitate user management with access rules and even concurrent connections to the same terminal session with the admins taking turns having write access.  In the world of serial consoles, this is all very exciting.  Well, I think it is exciting, anyway.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-conserver">Setting up conserver</h3>
<p>For this specific setup, I’ve installed and configured conserver in a very limited way.  Both servers run the conserver service independently rather than having it centralized.  I configure <code>console</code> in <code>/etc/hosts</code> to point to localhost on both systems.  This is needed because conserver’s client program, <code>console</code> looks to connect to the host named <code>console</code> by default.  And finally, the <code>/etc/conserver.cf</code> configuration is minimal and defines just enough to instruct it to manage the tty of our connected USB serial adaptor (<code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> in my case for both systems).</p>
<p>On each server I install the following two packages which are availible in the <code>EPEL</code> repo for REHL/CentOS and the base <code>fedora</code> repo for Fedora:</p>
<ul>
<li>conserver</li>
<li>conserver-client</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ sudo dnf install -y conserver conserver-client</code></p>
<p>I’ve found that this package doesn’t create the default log directory, so I need to do that ahead of time:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /var/consoles</code></p>
<p>This minimal configuration will set up a managed session named <code>peer</code> for device <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.  If you would rather use the hostname of the remote system, then change that.  And of course, adjust the tty name if it doesn’t match what is correct for your environment.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tcl"><span># /etc/conserver.cf

</span><span></span>default <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        logfile <span>/</span>var<span>/</span>consoles<span>/&amp;</span><span>;</span>        <span># '&amp;' is replaced with console name

access <span>*</span> <span>{</span>
        trusted <span>127.0</span>.0.1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Lastly, I enable and start the conserver daemon:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo systemctl enable --now conserver</code></p>
<h3 id="using-conserver">Using conserver</h3>
<p>Now that I have installed and configured all of the hardware and software and have the two servers each connected to each other’s serial ports, I’m ready to connect with conserver’s <code>console</code> command.  In the example configuration above, I named the conserver session <code>peer</code>, and thus I connect by issuing the following:</p>
<p><code>$ console peer</code></p>
<p>If everything is working I should get a login prompt from the peer server when I hit enter after launching console.  The default escape sequence while within console is <code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> (ctrl and the e key, let go, then press c).  To disconnect from the console, enter the escape sequence, followed by a period (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>.</code>).  To see all of the control codes, type the escape sequence, followed by a question mark (<code>ctrl</code>-<code>e</code> <code>c</code> <code>?</code>).  The man page on <code>console</code> explains the rest, however that covers the basics to connect and disconnect from the running console session.  You can review log history from within the same interface, but I usually find it easier to open the generated log file in <code>/var/console</code> with my favorite pager.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>So far this setup has served me well and I have already needed to use remote console access a few times while doing installs and network interface reconfigurations without …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl&quot;" height="488" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv.jpg" width="600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-320w.jpg 320w"></p><p>The design doc is <em>the place to write down the trade-offs</em> you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz</a> team has been working hard on moving our primary listen store from <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> to <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>, and today at UTC 16:00 we’re going to make the switch.</p>



<p>We were asked on Twitter as to why we’re making the switch — and in the interest of giving a real world use case for switching, I’m writing this post. The reasons are numerous:</p>



<p><strong>Openness</strong>: InfluxDB seems on a path that will make it less open over time. TimescaleDB and its dependence on Postgres makes us feel much safer in this regard.</p>



<p><strong>Existing use</strong>: We’ve been using Postgres for about 18 years now and it has been a reliable workhorse for us. Our team thinks in terms of Postgres and InfluxDB  always felt like a round peg in a square hole for us.</p>



<p><strong>Data structure</strong>: InfluxDB was clearly designed to store server event info. We’re storing listen information, which has a slightly different usage pattern, but this slight difference is enough for us to hit a brick wall with far fewer users in our DB than we ever anticipated. InfluxDB is simply not flexible enough for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>Query syntax and measurement names</strong>: The syntax to query InfluxDB is weird and obfuscated. We made the mistake of trying to have a measurement map to a user, but <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/b0846d2a/listenbrainz/utils.py#L42">escaping measurement names correctly</a> nearly drove one of our team members to the loonie bin. </p>



<p><strong>Existing data</strong>: If you ever write bad data to a measurement in InfluxDB, there is no way to change it. I realize that this is a common Big Data usage pattern, but for us it represented significant challenges and serious restrictions to put simple features for our users into place. With TimescaleDB we can make the very occasional UPDATE or DELETE and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even though we attempted to read as much as possible in order to design a scalable schema, we still failed and got it wrong. (I don’t even think that the docs to calculate scalability even existed when we first started using InfluxDB.) Unless you are using InfluxDB in exactly the way it was meant to be used, there are chances you’ll hit this problem as well. For us, one day insert speed dropped to a ridiculously low number per second, backing up our systems. Digging into the problem we realized that our schema design had a fatal flaw and that we would have drastically change the schema to something even less intuitive in order to fix it.  This was the event that broke the camel’s back and I started searching for alternatives. </p>



<p>In moving to TimescaleDB we were able to delete a ton of complicated code and embrace a DB that we know and love. We know how Postgres scales, we know how to put it into production and we know its caveats. TimescaleDB allows us to be flexible with the data and the amazing queries that can be performed on the data is pure Postgres love. TimescaleDB still requires some careful thinking over using Postgres, it is far less than what is required when using InfluxDB. TimescaleDB also gives us a clear scaling path forward, even when TimescaleDB is still working on their own scaling roadmap. If TimescaleDB evolves anything like Postgres has, I can’t wait to see this evolution.</p>



<p>Big big thanks to the Postgres and TimescaleDB teams! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>

<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>

<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>



<p>On the web:</p>



<h2>It’s always better to own your platform</h2>



<p>This advice is accurate for any form of content, be it blog posts or a video.</p>



<p>Until you host your content on your platform, they will always live at the mercy of the company hosting the platform.</p>



<p>I was not the only case where Medium’s algorithm went haywire; it happened with other people as well:</p>



<figure><div>

<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>



<p>Also, Google might add negative signals for your website, thinking that you copy-pasted an article from Medium on your blog.</p>



<p>Tread carefully.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> As pointed out in the comments section, Medium has an&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post" rel="noreferrer noopener">import tool</a>&nbsp;which allows you to add a canonical link from your Medium post to your original blog post. </p>



<p>This process ensures that Google does not think of your blog post as a duplicate. Thanks to Nicolas and Matthias for this correction.&nbsp;🥂</p>



<h2>Tell me about your strategy</h2>



<p>Now that you know the disadvantages of blogging on Medium, what do you think?</p>



<p>Will you be <a href="https://hulry.com/back-to-wordpress/">moving your blog</a> from Medium? Or vice-versa?</p>



<p>Have you already moved from Medium? Love to hear that story too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-94edc3520e97f986fec9"><div><p>Here are all of V. Rose's <em>testimonia</em>&nbsp;of a work attributed to Aristotle called <em>Magic (</em>ὁ Μαγικός λόγος, or τὸ μαγικόν?). The title either refers to the art practised by the Magi (the Zoroastrian priests from Persia), or it refers to the fact that the discussion is a discussion about the Magi. The latter seems more likely, even though the first passage, from Diogenes Laertius, suggests the discussion mentioned all sorts of wisdom cults.</p><p>The attribution is disputed. Diogenes Laertius says it is by Aristotle, but doesn't put it in his list of Aristotle's works (it doesn't show up in any other list I've looked at in either Greek or Arabic). The Suda says it is by Antisthenes, and that some people attributed it to Aristotle or someone named Rhodon. It's not clear where the Suda is getting this from.</p><p>While we don't know who wrote it, its contents are hinted at by the testimonies gathered in Rose (+ a few others I've put together). Diogenes reports that Aristotle thought magic wasn't sorcery, but philosophy or wisdom. This is confirmed by the Suda. It has something to do with prognostication. Eudoxus, according to Pliny,&nbsp;believed it was useful and very valuable, and so it was not only practical but connected to more valuable objects of study, probably the heavenly bodies. This is especially supported by the etymology of Zoroaster ('star-diviner') reported by Diogenes,&nbsp;and Porphyry's etymology of 'magus' as 'wise in divine matters'. Philo specifies that it was a kind of 'optics'&nbsp;and a very precise branch of natural science. Finally, Philo, Porphyry and the Suda associate it with both wisdom <em>and </em>with kingship. Philo says not only private citizens practice magic, but that Persian kings themselves had to be educated as Magi to become king.</p><p>It seems to me as if all these testimonies could be referring to a discussion of wise philosopher kings who are able to predict the future through their understanding of the heavens and the science of nature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520798591087_18030"><div><p>"Some say the work of philosophy originated with the barbarians. For among the Persians are the Magi, among the Babylonians and Assyrians the Chaldeans, among the Indians the Gymnosophists (lit. naked philosophers), and among the Celts and Gauls, those called 'Druids' and holy people, according to what Aristotle says in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Sotion in the twenty-third book of the <em>Succession of Philosophers</em>."</p><p>Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ' Ἰνδοῖς, παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους δρυίδας καὶ σεμνοθέους, καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς διαδοχῆς.</p><p><strong>Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</em>, 1.1</strong></p><p>"The Magi were ignorant of sorcerers' magic, says Aristotle in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Dinon in the fifth book of his <em>Histories</em>. He also says 'Zoroaster' when translated literally means 'star-diviner'; Hermodorus says this as well. In the first book of <em>On Philosophy</em>, Aristotle says they (the Magi) are actually older than the Egyptians. And according to them there are two principles, a good daimon and a bad daimon: to the former, the name is Zeus and 'Oromasdes' [i.e., Ahura Mazda], to the other Hades and 'Arimanius' [i.e., Ahriman]. Hermippus says this too in the first book <em>On Magi</em>, so does Eudoxus in the <em>Survey</em>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of the <em>Philippics</em>."</p><p>Τὴν δὲ γοητικὴν μαγείαν [sc. οἱ Μάγοι] οὐδ' ἔγνωσαν, φησὶν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Δείνων ἐν τῇ πέμπτῃ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν· ὃς καὶ μεθερμηνευόμενόν φησι τὸν Ζωροάστρην ἀστροθύτην εἶναι· φησὶ δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Ἑρμόδωρος.

Aristotle says this too."</p><p>Eudoxus qui inter sapientiae sectas clarissimam utilissimamque eam (magicam) intellegi voluit, Zoroastren hunc sex milibus annorum ante Platonis mortem fuisse prodidit. sic et Aristoteles.</p><p><strong>Pliny, <em>Natural History</em>, 30.3</strong></p><p>"Antisthenes, an Athenian, Socratic philosopher from among the orators, who first was called a Peripatetic, then 'played the dog' (i.e., acted like someone from what would later be called the 'Cynic' school). He was the son of a father with the same name, and his mother came from the people of Thrace. He wrote these ten volumes: first, <em>Magic</em>: it tells about a certain <em>magus</em>, Zoroaster, who discovered wisdom.

<hr>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is an efficient modern approach to public-key cryptosystems. In this introduction, our goal will be to focus on the high-level principles of what makes ECC work. We will omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another article.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Its_For">What It’s&nbsp;For?</span>
</h2>



<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, we can use ECC to ensure that when we send an email, no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="ECC_is_public_key_cryptography">ECC is public key cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Helman, etc. I’m going to give a very simple background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point so that we can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>







<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>



<h2><span id="An_Example_of_Public-Key-Cryptography">An Example of Public-Key-Cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the President sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using Public Key Cryptography would go like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li>
<li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li>
<li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li>
<li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key= “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>As you can see this is a very useful concept. Here are some key points:</p>



<ul>
<li>The public key can be sent to anyone. It is public.</li>
<li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li>
<li>Computers can very quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and the private key to decrypt a message.</li>
<li>Computers require a very long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="How_it_Works_The_Trapdoor_Function">How it Works: The Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>



<p>Not a trapdoor function: <em>A + B = C</em></p>



<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. The problem is that if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>



<p>Trapdoor function:</p>



<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key –&gt; “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em>, but if given <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>In RSA (Probably the most popular public-key system) the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>



<p>Public Key:<em> 944,871,836,856,449,473</em></p>



<p>Private Key: <em>961,748,941</em> and <em>982,451,653</em></p>



<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>



<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>



<h2><span id="What_Makes_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Different">What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</span>
</h2>



<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allows two parties to communicate securely.</p>

<h2><span id="ECCs_Trapdoor_Function">ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool. First, we start with a certain point on the curve. Next, we use a function (called the dot function) to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Lets walk through the algorithm.</p>







<ul>
<li>Starting at A:</li>
<li>A dot B = -C (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -C to C</li>
<li>A dot C = -D (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -D to D</li>
<li>A dot D = -E (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -E to E</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it is very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>



<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>



<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>



<h2><span id="Questions">Questions?</span>
</h2>



<p>Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>



<h3><span id="How_is_the_second_point_found_If_the_dot_function_is_basically_drawing_a_line_between_two_points_dont_you_need_a_second_point_to_start_with">How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</span>
</h3>



<p>Answer: No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>



<p>P dot P= -R</p>



<p>So what is P dot P? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>







<h3><span id="What_happens_if_the_dot_function_produces_a_line_that_will_go_way_off_out_to_some_extreme">What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</span>
</h3>



<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>







<h3><span id="I_get_the_trapdoor_function_but_how_are_public_and_private_keys_created_in_practice_How_are_they_used_in_conjunction_with_data_to_be_encrypted">I get the trapdoor function, but how are public and private keys created in practice? How are they used in conjunction with data to be encrypted?</span>
</h3>



<p>This is a great question, but it requires a much more in-depth answer. I gave very hand-wavy explanations of both RSA and ECC in this article. However, there are plenty of more technical resources out there and I encourage you to look into them.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="Who_Cares">Who Cares?</span>
</h2>



<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save 90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from a bloaty RSA system to a more modern elliptic curve approach. Hopefully, we’ve helped you gain a high-level understanding ECC and public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

July 21, 2020 | https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I recently became aware of Jeff Bezosâ€™s dotcom-era policy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231457/https://blog.hirevue.com/sales/what-i-learned-from-jeff-bezos-about-sales-management">banning PowerPoint</a> within Amazon. Instead, meeting organizers must write a multi-page â€œnarrativeâ€� and distribute it to all attendees at the start of the meeting - denying any single person a head start - and only after everyone has finished reading do proceedings begin.</p>

<p>This policy is particularly notable as it finds itself embedded in a company staffed largely by software engineers, who often have neither experience nor interest in writing prose. We feel most at home when transmitting ideas as algorithms, unambiguously described by mathematics and sequences of instructions. And the further we stray from this the more discontent we feel as the ambiguities of natural language leak through, needlessly eroding clarity.</p>

<p>But on closer examination I believe this is neither about powerpoint nor about reading - itâ€™s about thinking. To see why we need to look beyond the headline.</p>

<p>If we could peer into Jeffâ€™s 2004-era outbox we would find his original email:</p>

<div><p>
From: Bezos, Jeff <br>
Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 2004 6:02PM <br>
To: [REDACTED] <br>
Subject: Re: No powerpoint presentations from now on at steam </p><p>

A little more to help with the question "why." <br>
Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint. <br>
The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related. <br>
Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. </p><p>

Jeff
</p></div>

<p>The point being made is clear from the language: â€œwritingâ€� is mentioned twice but â€œreadingâ€� not at all. Itâ€™s  <em>creation</em> which is important, not <em>consumption</em>. Even if the memo was written and immediately shredded, the act of writing would not be undone and the improvement to thought and understanding would persist.</p>

<p>Still, for a company trying to be <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/working/working-amazon">Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company</a>, it is hard to shake the feeling that time would be best spent interacting with, say, <em>customers</em>, rather than crafting narratives.</p>

<p>But Amazon is far from the first to recognise the value in the writing process. Some go even further:</p>

<blockquote cite="David McCullough">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.</blockquote>

<p>And here I think itâ€™s worth digging even further to ask - why is thinking clearly important? <em>Obviously</em> - in our context of software engineering - if you donâ€™t think clearly then any solutions you craft as an individual will be suboptimal.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true. But more importantly, writing a coherent and logical narrative forces your thoughts into a shape which can be easily communicated to others and used to persuade. None of us work in isolation. There is little point in having the answer if you cannot convince others of its merit.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Letâ€™s imagine a team of engineers. Having just been informed of the firm-wide mandate to migrate from in-house servers to the cloud, they must make the impactful and long-lasting decision about which technology to introduce. In an attempt to reach consensus theyâ€™ve gathered around a pizza and begin exchanging views.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes guy <em>knows</em> that only his solution leads to a future free from tedious discussions around the solved problems of authentication and service discovery. Batteries must be included. Three slices to the right another engineer brims with confidence and espouses the virtues of Nomad - single-purpose, orthogonal and composable components are the <em>bedrock</em> of well-engineered software systems. Principles must come first.</p>

<p>After an hour of discussion bouncing from feature to feature to pro to con to bug to feature, everyone has learned something new. But no one is persuaded and no consensus has emerged. Though useful for knowledge exchange, such unstructured discussions are not an efficient mechanism for reaching agreement.</p>

<p>What is needed to break the stalemate is for a single individual<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to spin a narrative which captures the journey from business need through to practicalities of implementation, in a comprehensive, flowing and logical manner. This would be persuasive - it would instill in others the confidence that this is not just the best technology in an abstract sense, itâ€™s the right choice for <em>our problem</em>, <em>our business</em>, and <em>our people</em> at <em>this point in time</em>.</p>

<p>It would be useful for others to read this. But even if they didnâ€™t, the newfound clarity of mind of the creator would allow them to make an argument persuasive enough to break the stalemate of ideas.</p>

<p>For this particular situation - the choice of a technology - the writer will likely have thought about and touched on:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the underlying reasons for the decision to change technologies? Why is this worthwhile embarking on and what benefits will be seen?</li>
  <li>What reason do we have for investigating this particular tech as a solution? What other alternatives are worth investigating?</li>
  <li>How high are the stakes? Are we laying the foundations of the cathedral or painting the bike shed? Can we easily switch later if things arenâ€™t working out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The middle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the tech being suggested have a mission statement or core guiding principles? How does that tie in with our problem and philosophy?</li>
  <li>If we roll with it, whatâ€™s the end goal? When implementation is complete, what does the world look like?</li>
  <li>How might we get from where we are to where we want to be with minimal disruption? What might the transition period look like? How long, roughly?</li>
  <li>Do we have any existing in-house expertise?</li>
  <li>Are there any risks? What steps might we take to reduce them? Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>?</li>
  <li>In what ways might this solution fare better than the alternative(s)?</li>
  <li>In what ways might the alternative(s) fare better than this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The end</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Relate back to the underlying business needs and sum up with a recommendation, explaining why this the best option</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the content of the narrative would overlap substantially with a technical design document. But whereas a TDD is an end in itself, the physical output of this writing is a pleasant side-effect. What matters are the organised thoughts left in the mind of the author.</p>

<p>Having competently translated these thoughts into natural language once before, the author will have no trouble doing so again when called upon, orally and in real-time. And having considered the problem at several levels of analysis - as must be done to write well - they will, at a moments notice, be able to adapt their narrative to suit any audience, regardless of their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike specialised tools, narratives are general. They scale. From the narrowest of technical issues up to the most fundamental question of the mission and purpose of the company as a whole, there are no problems which resist clear-thinking.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    </p><p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.

    </p><p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses
        a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  No big problem, I used an external WiFi adaptor.<br>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided to make their
        machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it
        by visibly carrying it around.  I could have continued using it
        privately with its free software installation, but I had no need
        for another computer to use only privately.

    </p><p>
        The results that seemed likely, millions of children running Windows
        on the OLPC, have not occurred.  Instead we see millions of children
        running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a Chromebook
	that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    </p><p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    </p><h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> —
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    </p><p>
        I've chosen not to have any preferences among those ethical distros.
        In fact, I am not in a position to judge them on other criteria:
        even to try them all would be a lot work of that I have no need to do.



    </p><h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.

    </p><p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.
        I have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my interest in using graphical environments is small,
        I don't want to spend time comparing them.

    </p><p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    </p><p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    </p><p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.



    </p><h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="https://stallman.org/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    </p><p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.

    </p><h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that involved transmission via UUCP.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div><p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                </p><p>
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running..

	    </p></div><p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.

            </p><p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but that does not bother me.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                </p><p>
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it
                (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a
                situation).

            </p></div><p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor.
                Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think
                that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with
                me. IceCat blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            </p><p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because I cannot
		pay anonymously.  Anything on the net that requires
		payment that would identify me, I don't do.  (I made
		an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain,
		since that is connected with me anyway.)

	    </p><p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on
		paying cash.  When a business pressures you to pay in
		an identified way, it's your chance to defend freedom by
		saying, "If you won't take my cash, no sale!"

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="https://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For searching, I have mostly used DuckDuckGo for the past
                few years.  It does work with JS disabled, but you have
                to follow a link before you search.

            </p><p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            </p><p>
                I no longer use Google search, not even occasionally, because
                it sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it tries to
                send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            </p><p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is that it
                depends on nonfree Javascript.  I won't run that in my computer.
                I am not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't bypass
                Tor. Therefore, I can't use Google search any more.

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

<p><small><em>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:37:19 +0200</em></small></p>

<p>Many browsers today are gigantic resource hogs, which are basically
VMs for various web applications. On the other hand, <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a> is a HTML
browser. It is not able to do everything. It allows me to avoid most
distractions and control the content-experience. The goal of this
exercise is not to force anyone to use this browser, but just to be
watchful and conscious of their hypertext based internet usage (one
might use gopher, and this phlog is available there, but probability
tells me that a person reading this reads this from hypertext source
and I am sure they are lovely).</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I use links compiled with X11 support and with <a href="https://gist.github.com/lich-tex/4795eeccf9b4e9ae21c94a65f7527ff2">Xembed patch</a> for
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/">tabbed</a>. I execute it using <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/glinks">a script</a>, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/dsurfraw">surfraw with
dmenu</a> to have a uniform search function and bookmarks that work with
all my browsers. That is all you need to know. Interesting trivia:
Julian Assange made surfraw. Huh.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>First, I want to focus on ‘destruction’ of CSS. As Links does not
support modern CSS it renders most of the internet as-is, and will
only contain images (on which I will write later). CSS causes the
internet to become a baroque set of arbitrary design decisions, and
does not contribute positively to the general experience. Links (after
2.19) allows me to pick my own font, my own background/foreground/url
color. Thus, I have a uniform experience. In that I already visibly
save time/energy/brain processing power, etc. To deal with senselessly
complex sites (news pages with &gt;1 MB JS, I am looking at you) I use
and <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/miniwebproxy">tedu’s miniwebproxy</a>. It delimits the content even more, and
removes elements that are not of interest for me (top,bottom,side
bars, recommended content, etc.).</p>

<h2>JS</h2>

<p>JS is the main cause for the way internet changed, for better or
worse. It changed content into dissimilar applications. It allowed for
measurement of attention and penalization of the experience. I am
critical of that, and Links has no JS support. Perfect. Nothing more
to be spoken of. If I need JS I will use another browser which
emulates anything Google considers good internet experience. But, that
<em>currently</em> is not my goal.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Now, going from a little controversy to a giant controversy. Images (in the
modern web) are uninformative, but are simply advertisements of
content. They are made to take over your attention and again, make the
experience less uniform. Links does not force you to disable images
(as there are cases when they are useful - i.e. Wikipedia), but has a
function to not load them. Again, as with everything it allows for
more uniformity.</p>

<h2>Sad facts</h2>

<p>The word attempt is key here, and primarily I use it for Wikipedia
articles, directed searches (with surfraw), browsing youtube
through <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, browsing twitter through <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter.net</a>, but sadly
majority of my usage still ends up in a Chrome-like (that includes
Firefox). But writing and thinking like this allows to see what are
the issues with the modern web and how they can be approached. Using Links
is a radical solution, but as with many <a href="https://www.rationalwalk.com/via-negativa-wisdom-through-subtraction/">via negativa</a> solutions, they
teach us what are the things that are needed for valuable UX.</p>

<h2>Should I?</h2>

<p>I think trying is great. I have not explained how to do it, cause the
task of that is manpages and other analysis to get to know your wanted
experience, and not the wanted experience of someone else. Although,
it just maybe a continuation of a liberal dream of ability to control
your own consumer experience. The reality is you never have to, as
there is no possibility of changing the entire <em>internet</em> for better,
but you might find things that you can make better. Or only not worse.
You can also try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>, but it is much more radical experience.</p>

<![CDATA[Is every game of Slay the Spire winnable?]]>
            </title>

July 21, 2020 | https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/Is-Every-Seed-Winnable/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/Is-Every-Seed-Winnable/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>There is a lot of randomness in a game of Slay the Spire. From the cards and relics offered, to the potions dropped, to the map layouts and random encounters, very little remains the same between two playthroughs. This is part of the beauty of the game, forcing you to adapt and make the most out of the resources you have been given in each new attempt. However, with such randomness comes a natural question: can every run of Slay the Spire be won? In this article, I will discuss what I believe to be the current state of knowledge about the answer to this question.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-interpretations-of-the-question">The two interpretations of the question</h2>

<p>Before we begin answering, first there is one detail to get straight: the question of whether every game can be won can actually be interpreted in two different ways. Both are valid and interesting questions, and have very different answers. Here are some more precise formulations of each question:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Can a perfect player win every game of Slay the Spire?” (alternatively, “Is there a strategy that achieves a 100% win rate in Slay the Spire?”)</li>
  <li>“For every <em>seed</em> of Slay the Spire, is there a sequence of decisions that results in a win?”</li>
</ol>

<p>The first question concerns the performance of a player that makes the theoretically optimal decisions at every point in the game to maximize its win rate, given the information available. Generally, there is no computationally feasible way to actually play optimally, so this question is very difficult to answer. However, in many respects, it is the more useful question to a player looking to maximize their own win rate, as it shows how close they are to playing optimally. As an example for how to answer these types of questions, however, we may look at another game with heavy randomness: Minesweeper.</p>

<p>Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the objective is to find the hidden locations of mines, using the number of surrounding mines as clues. Despite having simple rules, perfect play is still very difficult to achieve. However, even without knowing how to play perfectly, we can still prove that a perfect player cannot win every game. For example, in the Minesweeper game below, the two remaining mines can either be in the squares marked “A” or the squares marked “B”, and a guess must be made. Because such positions are guaranteed to arise in some seeds, not every game of Minesweeper can be won, even following an optimal strategy.</p>

<p><img src="https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/images/image-20200621005308075.png" alt="image-20200621005308075"></p>

<p>Now, I’ve used the word <em>seed</em> twice, but what does it mean? In a computer game with randomness, a seed is a sequence of letters or numbers which determines all of the randomness in a playthrough. For Minesweeper, this means all the mines are in the same location each time you play a seed. Therefore, each seed is winnable by simply learning which squares do not contain mines. To summarize, for Minesweeper, the answer to our two questions would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“Can a perfect player win every game?” <strong>No.</strong></li>
  <li>“Can every seed be won?” <strong>Yes.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We can go even further, and refine our answer to question 1, by asking how often a perfect player is expected to win. Again, this question is usually impossible to answer exactly, but because any strategy’s win rate is a lower bound for the optimal win rate, we can develop intuition about the answer by analyzing the win rate of players. In particular, for Minesweeper, I found that computer programs have been written to obtain about a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minesweeper/comments/8my10k/automated_solver_with_high_win_rate/">40% win rate</a> on Expert difficulty, which means that with perfect play, you can expect to win at least 40% of the time.</p>

<p>For Slay the Spire, however, answering either question is much more difficult, due to the much higher complexity of the game. For this post, I will mostly focus on the second question, of whether a completely impossible seed exists. This is because the existence of an impossible seed is much easier to definitively establish, and if an impossible seed exists, then obviously a perfect player also cannot win on that impossible seed, also answering question 1. However, at the end of the post, I will also provide my thoughts about the win rate of optimal play.</p>

<h2 id="randomness-in-slay-the-spire">Randomness in Slay the Spire</h2>

<p>Randomness and seeds in Slay the Spire are much more complicated than they are in Minesweeper. However, every random event in a run of Slay the Spire is still determined by the game seed, which can be found on the top right of the screen in-game. Using the same seed and making the same decisions always results in the same outcomes. However, the exact mechanics of the game’s randomness are too complicated to cover here. For the purposes of this post, it is sufficient to note that the following things are almost always the same for a seed, no matter what the player does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The map layouts</li>
  <li>The order of the normal and elite fights in each act</li>
  <li>The bonuses offered by Neow at the start of the run (for this post I assume there is a Neow bonus)</li>
  <li>The contents of unknown (?) rooms on the map (e.g. the first unknown room is always an event in this seed)</li>
  <li>The enemy AI for a particular encounter (not counting things like splitting slimes)</li>
</ul>

<p>And these things can often have a fairly small number of different outcomes depending on prior choices in the run (for example, taking a card from Neow may change the card rewards from the first combat node):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Card rewards</li>
  <li>Potion drops</li>
  <li>The order of events encountered</li>
  <li>Outcomes of events</li>
  <li>Contents of shops</li>
</ul>

<p>The important takeaway here is that there is only a very limited amount that the player can manipulate their deck, relics, potions, and encounters, especially early in Act 1. This means that there may really be a possibility for a seed having such bad card, relic, and encounter options that it is completely impossible, no matter what the player does.</p>

<h2 id="what-might-an-unwinnable-seed-look-like">What might an unwinnable seed look like?</h2>

<p>Since aspects like map layouts, potion drops, events, combats, Neow rewards, and card rewards are mostly static when replaying the same seed, a good starting point is to try to design the worst outcomes for each of these categories, and ask if those outcomes are enough to force the player to lose. For this, we will focus on a particular ruleset of Slay the Spire: Ascension 20 Silent. This choice is made because of the extra difficulty that Silent faces in defeating early elite encounters in Act 1, before the player can tailor their resources towards the specific problems posed by a given seed. In particular:</p>

<h3 id="silent-cannot-kill-lagavulin-with-the-starter-deck">Silent cannot kill Lagavulin with the starter deck.</h3>

<p>By considering the maximum damage that can be dealt with perfect shuffle luck, it is possible to prove that killing Lagavulin is impossible with Silent’s starter deck. She simply cannot deal enough damage before her strength is reduced to -6, and all attacks become ineffective. Let us consider an example fight (Strike=S, Defend=D, Neutralize=N, Survivor=U, Ascender’s Bane=B):</p>

<p>Because we can only play 5 strikes and 1 Neutralize per two turns, the maximum damage dealt to Lagavulin turns out to be 110 on Ascension 20, with the starter deck. However, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsxNXebbELpcCi8N7FVOTNGdX_K9-BRC_LMgx4TORo4/edit#gid=1989923881&amp;range=B84">Lagavulin always has at least 112 HP</a>, so victory is impossible.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-can-force-an-elite-fight-on-floor-6">The game can force an elite fight on floor 6.</h3>

<p>With particularly bad luck, the map generation algorithm can force the player to fight an elite on floor 6, which is the lowest possible floor for elites to spawn. With even more bad luck, the map might not have any shops or rest sites before this forced elite fight. This severely restricts the resources the player can have going into this forced elite fight.</p>

<p><img src="https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/images/image-20200621204739562.png" alt="image-20200621204739562"></p>

<h3 id="the-silent-might-not-find-any-useful-cards-or-potions-before-floor-6">The Silent might not find any useful cards or potions before floor 6</h3>

<p>We already know the Silent cannot kill Lagavulin without additional card rewards, due to a lack of damage in her starting deck. Of course, the Silent will not fight Lagavulin until floor 6, but the game may not actually give any useful resources in this period. For example, here is a set of options from Neow which does not help the Silent deal damage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove one card</li>
  <li>Gain 100 gold</li>
  <li>Gain 250 gold, lose HP</li>
  <li>Boss swap (for Black Star)</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to how potion drops work, even after fighting the maximum of five fights before the first elite, there is a 0.72% chance of still not receiving a potion from any of them. Even if a potion drops, many, such as the Dexterity Potion, do not help the Silent deal more damage.</p>

<p>Finally, there are many Silent cards which do not increase the amount of damage that can be dealt to Lagavulin with the basic deck. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deflect</li>
  <li>Outmaneuver</li>
  <li>Piercing Wail</li>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>Blur</li>
  <li>Concentrate</li>
  <li>Escape Plan</li>
  <li>Footwork</li>
  <li>Reflex</li>
</ul>

<p>It is entirely possible, though extraordinarily unlikely, to be offered only cards from this list in the first five floors of the game, plus from Neow. Therefore, we have the following theoretical scenario for an unwinnable run:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forced Lagavulin elite fight on floor 6, with no shops or rest sites on the first five floors</li>
  <li>No Neow bonuses, potion drops, or card rewards which help the player deal damage to Lagavulin</li>
</ol>

<p>If any seed contains all of these components, then that seed cannot be won (on A20 Silent), no matter what the player does. Therefore, it seems likely that an unwinnable seed exists.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-unwinnable-seed">Finding an unwinnable seed</h2>

<p>Now that we have constructed a set of circumstances that produce an unwinnable seed, the natural next step is to find such a seed. Fortunately, a long time ago, I created a <a href="https://github.com/ForgottenArbiter/SeedSearch">tool</a> for exactly this task. I programmed the search to find seeds with the following parameters, assuming ascension 20 Silent play on PC with full unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A forced floor-6 elite fight with no shops or rest sites below it</li>
  <li>No useful Neow rewards or boss relic swaps</li>
  <li>Not many useful damage cards in the first few card rewards (it was too restrictive to filter for no damage cards whatsoever)</li>
  <li>Four forced …</li></ul></div></div>

		<p>We built Repl.it to make it easy to explore and learn languages and programming paradigms. We’ve grown a community that, like us, is <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Wildest-programming-language-idea/42923">excited</a> by languages. We were, however, surprised by how slow-moving the programming language space seems to be. Given how fast software is growing, shouldn’t we see more innovation in programming languages?</p>
<p>We can think of a programming language as either a tool built to be good at a software domain or as a medium for thought and expression. If languages are indeed tools, then some languages would be better than others for a given task. For example, if I want to build a web server with reliable performance, I might use Golang because it has a solid standard library and concurrency primitives. Whereas, if I'm making a UI, I might want to use JavaScript for its first-class support for event-driven programming. On the other hand, if we think about languages as mediums of expression, choosing a language becomes less about objective qualities and more about aesthetics and ergonomics. </p>
<p>But if languages are tools, shouldn't we see many more language variations to cover the ever-increasings niches that software is entering? Similarly, if languages are mediums of thought, and there are more and more people interested in expressing themselves digitally, shouldn't we expect to see many more types of languages?</p>
<p>One answer could be that programmers are not that interested in thinking about languages. Or that our languages today are sufficient and everyone is happy. But spend a few minutes on any programming forum, and it’ll become clear that a lack of enthusiasm and opinions on languages could not be the reason why we don’t see more programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn’t we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/jam.png" alt="language jam"></p>
<p>Well, here at Repl.it, we specialize in making hard things accessible, and we want to make creating programming languages easier, fun, exciting, and collaborative. Today, we're announcing the programming language jam and a $10,000 grant to a team that designs and prototypes a new language with emphasis on fresh and possibly wild ideas. The winning language will also get added to Repl.it, where anyone can quickly start using it to code. We’ll have prizes for individual category winners too.</p>
<p>The hackathon starts on <strong>August 10th</strong> and runs until <strong>August 31st</strong>. To enter, you have to create a Repl.it Team when registration opens with a minimum of two team members. <strong>Registration will open on August 1st</strong>. To be notified when registration opens, leave your email <a href="https://forms.gle/x3n4cDYQzdvFvci57">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Hackathon is judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> whose language experimentation spans toy Lisp interpreters to programming environments for kids</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, the creator of React.js and the Reason programming language</li>
<li>TBD: we're looking for more judges. Specifically people who are interested in wild programming language ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="can-anyone-participate">Can anyone participate?</h3>
<p>Yes! You don’t even need to have any prior experience making languages. To help you get started, we created these tutorials and templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-Python/45767">Making your own programming language with Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-NodeJS/45779">Making your own programming language with NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here also also some links to other websites that can help you learn the basics of making your own languages:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-language-should-it-be">What kind of language should it be?</h2>
<p>Any kind -- it could be dynamic, compiled, or whatever. We’re particularly interested in fresh ideas. So the only criteria are that it’s a language you can program in :)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-get-if-i-win">What do I get if I win?</h2>
<p>You get $5,000 upfront, and $5,000 over two months to continue working on the language after the jam. We ask you to try to get to a usable version of the language to be added to Repl.it in three months after the jam.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-code-it-on-replit">Do I have to code it on Repl.it?</h2>
<p>During the jam, we ask all participants to code and submit their projects on Repl.it to make it easy for our judges to run your project, and for our users to interact and potentially fork and remix your language. We ask that you make one demo repl that it’s easy to run and try. </p>
<p>After the jam, it’s up to you where you want to finish coding the language. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-be-a-judge">Can I be a judge?</h2>
<p>Yes -- reach out to us on Twitter or email, and we’d be happy to chat. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-remix-or-improve-on-an-existing-language">Can I remix or improve on an existing language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as you're adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the language.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-domain-specific-language-dsl">Can I make a Domain Specific Language (DSL)?</h2>
<p>Yes. As long as the DSL deviates from the host language in constructs and syntax. For example GraphQL is useful/interesting on its own despite being embedded in JavaScript</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-non-turing-complete-language">Can I make a non-turing complete language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as it's useful and not purely academic. </p>

<p>Please send a pull request to add it to our base image <a href="https://github.com/replit/polygott">Polygott</a>. For example Paul Bone, submitted this <a href="https://github.com/replit/polygott/pull/136">PR</a> to add Mercury to Repl.it and was merged quickly.</p>

		<p>Making music is expensive. The hardware is expensive enough, but buying all the software you need can round up to thousands of dollars. A single license for a leading DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton Live can run up to $750.</p>
<p>But music production software doesn’t have to be so expensive.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the Open Source Software (OSS) route, you can get cutting-edge music making tools for $0.</p>
<p>Finding all the right tools, however, is a challenge. A lot of existing OSS lists are outdated – some of these tools haven’t been updated since 2004. Most existing articles aren’t comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent the last two days putting together the single most comprehensive list of current and available open source music production tools.<span id="more-4160"></span></p>
<p>Every single tool in this list had to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be free – no strings attached</li>
<li>It should be open source, that is, you should be able to access the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all open source software runs on Mac and Windows, most of the tools on this list do. And of course, every single one of them works on Linux.</p>
<p>These strict requirements meant that a lot of popular Linux music tools, like Reaper and Bitwig, did not make the cut. However, there are perfectly competent – and <em>free</em> – alternatives, as I’ve shared below.</p>
<p>Another thing – not everyone processes information the same way. So I’ve shared the same information as both a long table, as well as a categorized list of tools. You can jump to whichever tool you prefer using the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab-view">Table View</a></li>
<li><a href="#cat-view">Category View</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want detailed information about the license, availability, and source code/download links, refer to the table view. For a quick overview, use the category view.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with free software is a little more complicated than working with proprietary tools. Some of the tools I’ve shared below might also lack the features or user-friendliness (not that music software is particularly user-friendly to begin with!) of their paid counterparts. On the flip side, you get completely free software, and you support the FOSS community.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve also shared some thoughts on building a completely free studio, including my software recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="cat-view"><span>Open Source Music Production Tools (Category View)</span></h2>
<p>From audio editors to full-fledged digital audio workstations, there’s free music production software to fulfill most of your music making needs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top choices across each category:</p>
<h3>Working with audio</h3>

<h3>Utilities and others</h3>






<h2 id="tab-view"><span>Building a Free Music Production Studio</span></h2>
<p>After going through the list above, you’re probably thinking:&nbsp;<em>that’s a lot of software!</em></p>
<p>This was a (pleasant) surprise for me as well. I grew up with Cubase before moving onto Logic and eventually, Ableton. In this world of proprietary software, you’ve always had a lot of choice.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect the open source world to have as many&nbsp;<em>competent&nbsp;</em>offerings as well. Some of the DAWs I shared above can go toe-to-toe with the best in the closed source world.</p>
<p>If you’re new to music production, however, going through all these tools can be a little confusing (and overwhelming).</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, I’ll show you how to create a music production studio for $0 – all by using the tools listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand what you need to produce music</strong></h3>
<p>There are three parts to music production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition and arrangement</li>
<li>Sound synthesis and design</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these should be self-explanatory, but I’ll break them down further for the beginners reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and arrangement&nbsp;</strong>is the process of creating a piece of music and organizing different musical elements (i.e. “arranging”) to achieve a particular effect. If you write an original song on your guitar, that song would be called your “composition”.</p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, you can play this song in different styles (rock, pop, punk, etc.) – this is called “arrangement”.</p>
<p>In music production software, composition and arrangement usually happens on a timeline view. You can add/remove different musical elements at different to create a song. The timeline is typically divided into seconds and bars.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the timeline view in Ableton Live of one of my tracks:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4225"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="559" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4225">The Ableton timeline view makes it possible to create complex compositions and arrangements</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sound synthesis and design&nbsp;</strong>is the process of manipulating a sound or a signal to produce a desired effect. Add a distortion pedal to your electric guitar, and you’re essentially “designing” your own sound.</p>
<p>There are several approach to sound design and synthesis. You can take an audio clip (called a “sample”) and turn it into a sound via a “sampler”. Or you can use a synthesizer to manipulate a simple audio signal (such as a sine wave) into your desired sound. You can further modulate this sound using various effects like reverb, delay, etc. Add a reverb, for instance, and the sound will feel wider and roomier.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screenshot from one of the sounds I created in Serum, one of the most popular software synthesizers around.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4227"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="600" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg 721w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum-300x250.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/serum.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4227">Serum is a popular virtual synth that can help you create complex sounds</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Mixing and mastering&nbsp;</strong>is the process of adjusting volume, effects, equalization, compression, etc. to create a track that sounds good on different speakers/headphones. A “good” mix is a balanced mix. Mixing and mastering is usually done by audio engineers who carefully adjust EQ, …</p></div></div></article></div>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>If you are desperate for 6% smaller Go binaries, this blog post is for you. (I did this experiment to help out <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Disclosure: I'm an investor.) If binary size doesn't worry you, well, maybe you'll find it entertaining.</p>
<p>In order to get example numbers for this post, I grabbed a random item from my GOPATH. All the hard numbers in this blog post are for <code>github.com/mvdan/sh/cmd/shfmt</code>. From a bit of experimenting, they seem fairly representative.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9d812cfa5c">commit 9d812cfa5c</a> of the Go toolchain as my base commit. This is the <code>master</code> branch as of April 29, 2020; it will probably be similar to the Go 1.15beta1 release. I'm using it rather than Go 1.14 because it contains several binary size reductions, including <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/230544">one in particular</a> that you'll definitely want if you're concerned about binary sizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are lots of ways to shrink a binary. Removing extraneous dependencies is probably the best way. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210284">Avoiding global maps through judicious use of sync.Once</a> can help. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/228111">Keeping separable code separate by indirection</a> can help. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1255704982893912064">suppress equality algorithm generation</a> (ick…until you really need it). You can usually save double-digit percentages by stripping debugging information: pass <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38777"><code>-ldflags=-w</code> to <code>go build</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume you've done all that. And you still need to shrink more. And that need is so pressing you're willing to make some sacrifices for it.</p>
<p>Go binaries contain a lot more than just executable code. There are type descriptors that describe the types in a Go program. There are garbage collection data structures. There's debugger information. And there are mappings from PCs to position information. (And there's lots more, too.)</p>
<p>We're going to get rid of the position information.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can't just strip out the position information entirely from the binary. That would break lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But we can make all the line numbers the same. That shouldn't break anything. After all, no one (except gofmt) said we had to put our code on multiple lines.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <a href="https://play.golang.org/">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We could write <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/skI5nMleZgt">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> ( <span>"fmt"</span> ); <span>func</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>) }
</code></pre></div><p>The Go compiler and runtime has to be prepared for lots of stuff to be on one line.</p>
<p>We could write a preprocessor, maybe using <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies"><code>-toolexec</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives"><code>//line</code> directives</a>, but it's easier to just hack the compiler. Fortunately, this is well-factored code, so we only need to touch two little spots.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Every file is now named <code>x.go</code>, and every source position has line 1 and column 1. (Columns don't actually matter for binary size, once you've stripped DWARF.)</p>
<p>This isn't quite enough. There are two other spots in the toolchain that get unhappy if all code lives at <code>x.go:1:1</code>.</p>
<p>The first is in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38698">constructing DWARF</a>, for debuggers. We can just remove that check: We are already stripping DWARF, so generating invalid DWARF doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The second is in cgo. There are some security checks about where certain cgo pragma can be located. We're going to trust ourselves not to violate them (by ensuring all code keeps building with an unaltered toolchain), and remove that security check.</p>
<p>The full diff is at <a href="https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed">https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now all code we compile has <code>x.go:1:1</code> as its position.</p>
<p>Our program, compiled with <code>-ldflags=-w</code>, shrinks from 3,126,800 bytes to 2,938,384 bytes, or about 6%.</p>
<p>Most of this is from shrinking the encoding of position information. A little bit of it comes from a compiler optimization.</p>
<p>These two programs compile slightly differently:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>]
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span>, <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>], <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>If you run <code>go tool compile -S x.go</code> on each of these files, you'll see that <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/UFf2JL">the first program</a> contains two separate calls to <code>runtime.panicIndex</code>. <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/26rRog">The second program</a> contains only one such call. The reason is that <code>runtime.panicIndex</code> must display a backtrace containing the line number of the line that panicked. In the first program, we need two separate panics, one for each possible panicking line number. In the second program, we don't, so the compiler combines them.</p>
<p>Since we are now putting all code on the same line, the compiler can combine more panics than before.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we lose by doing this? Anything that needs accurate position information. Panic backtraces will still show you the PC, the function, the arguments, and so on. But all line numbers will be <code>x.go:1</code>. With patience, you could still figure out the line number yourself based on the PC, but it'd take some manual work. Pprof will still be able to analyze performance by function and by instruction, but it'll think everything happens on the same line, which will make analysis by line number useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's play around a bit. What if we ditch only filenames, and keep the true line numbers? It saves only 0.9%. And as you'd then expect, keeping only accurate filenames and making all line number 1 saves 5.1%.</p>
<p>So most of the savings are from the line numbers. What if we keep the original filenames, and truncate all line numbers to the nearest multiple of 16? That is, trim our diff down to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16*16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.2%. Not bad. What if we divide all line numbers by 16 instead? That preserves exactly the same information as truncating, but we have to multiply by hand to get the “nearby” line number.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.75%! Why does <code>/16</code> save 0.5% more than <code>/16*16</code>?</p>
<p>Line numbers are stored in the binary using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint">varint encoding</a> relative to the previous line number. Smaller numbers mean smaller deltas, and can thus be stored more efficiently.</p>

<![CDATA[Common mistakes writing React components with hooks]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

Specifically, I am referring to those companies which need to manage data and applications located on more than one server.</h4><p>It is essential for a company to monitor its infrastructure nodes, especially if the company does not have on-site access to intervene when issues arise. In fact, the intensive use of some resources can be an indication of malfunctioning or overcrowding. However, in addition to prevention, monitoring could be used to assess possible implications of new software in the production environment. Currently, there are several “ready-to-use” solutions on the market to keep track of all the resources consumed. These solutions, which appear reasonable, present two key problems: the high price of setup and security issues related to third parties.</p><p>The first problem is related to cost. Prices vary from 10 euros per month up to thousands depending on how many hosts you need to monitor — with the former being consumer pricing and the latter being enterprise pricing. So, for example, let’s imagine that I have three nodes to monitor during the course of a year. At 10 euros per month, I would spend 120 euros. For smaller enterprises, where the price can range between 10,000 and 20,000 euro per year, such an expense can bloat its underlying cost structure and become financially untenable.</p><p>The second problem is third party risk. Typically, infrastructure data must pass through a third party company in order to be seen and analysed for the customer — whether that be an individual consumer or an enterprise. How does the third party company capture the data and then present it to the customer? Simply put, the third party company often collects data through a custom agent that is installed onto a node and monitored. Quite often is it found that this installation is not up-to-date and compatible with operating systems. Previous work has been done by security researchers who cast light upon problems with <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments">“proprietary collectors”</a>. Would you trust them? I would not.</p><p>In keeping nodes for both <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor</a> and some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, I prefer to opt for a cost free, easy to configure, and open-source alternative. Here, we will use the triad: Grafana, InfluxDB, and CollectD.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-graphs.png" alt="An example of a Grafana dashboard"></p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse every metric of our infrastructure, it is necessary to use a program capable of capturing statistics on the machines we want to monitor. In this regard, <a href="https://collectd.org/">CollectD</a> comes to your aid: it is a daemon that groups and collects (hence the name) all the parameters that can be stored on disk or sent over the network.</p><p>The data will be transmitted to an instance of <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>: a particular time series database that associates to each data the time (coded in UNIX timestamp) in which the server received it. In this way, the data sent by CollectD will already be set in a temporal way, as a succession of events.</p><p>Finally, you will use <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> which will connect to InfluxDB to create flashy dashboards to display the data in a user-friendly way. Through histograms and graphs of every kind, it will be possible to observe in real time all the data related to CPU, RAM, etc.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-diagram.png" alt="Grafana infrastructure"></p><h2 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h2><picture>

InfluxDB is a time series database <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">open-source</a> developed in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> to store data as a sequence of events.</p><p>Each time data is added, it is linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">a UNIX timestamp</a> by default. This allows enormous flexibility for the user who no longer has to worry about saving, as an example, the “time” variable, which is sometimes cumbersome to configure. Let’s imagine we have several machines located in a number of continents. How do we manage the “time” variable? Do we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a> meridian for all the data? Or do we set a different time zone for each node? If data is saved on different time zones, how can we accurately display the graphs? As you can see, this can be very complicated.</p><p>As a time-aware database that automatically timestamps any data point, InfluxDB has the advantage of simultaneously being able to write to a certain database. This is why we often imagine InfluxDB as a timeline. Writing data does not affect the performance of the database (as sometimes happens in MySQL), since writing is simply the addition of a certain event to the timeline. The name of the program derives precisely from the conception of time as an infinite and indefinite “flow” that flows.</p><h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h3><p>Another advantage of InflxuDB is the <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/">ease of installation</a> and the extensive <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/">documentation</a> provided by the community that widely supports the project. It has two types of interfaces: via <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/">Command Line</a> (which is powerful and flexible for developers, but poorly prepared to see large amounts of data) and an <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/write_data/#sidebar">HTTP API</a> that allows direct communication with the database.</p><p>InfluxDB can be downloaded not only from the official website, but also from the package manager of the distribution (in this example we use a Debian system). It is advisable to check the package via GPG before installation, so (below) we import the keys of the InfluxDB package:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="acdec3c3d8ecc2c3c8c9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

By default, CollectD captures metrics on CPU, RAM, memory (on disk), network interfaces, processes, etc. The potential of the program is endless, given that it can be extended with a preinstalled <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins">plugin enablement</a> or through the <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Wishlist_.2F_Ideas">creation of new ones</a>.</p><p>As you can see, installing CollectD is simple:</p><p>In a simplistic manner, let’s illustrate how CollectD works. Suppose that I want to check how many processes my node has. In doing so, CollectD does nothing more than make an API call to get the number of processes per time unit (defined as 5000 ms, by default). Once captured, the data will be sent to InfluxDB via a module (called “Network”) to be configured.</p><p>Open the file <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code> with our editor, scroll to find the <code>Network</code> section, and edit as written in the following snippet. Be sure to specify the IP where the interface of InfluxDB (<code>INFLUXDB_IP</code>) is located.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="691b06061d2907060d0c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/collectd.conf

  &lt;/Server&gt;
  ReportStats true
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
    ...</code></pre></div><p>My suggestion is to modify, within the configuration, the hostname that is sent to InfluxDB (which in our infrastructure is a “centralized” database, since it resides on a single node). In doing so, the data will not be redundant and there is no risk that other nodes will overwrite the information.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/tres_caballeros.jpg" alt="Three daemon"></p><h2 id="grafana">Grafana</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana_alone.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>A graph is worth thousand of images</p></blockquote><p>In remembrance of this famous “quote”, observing the infrastructure metrics live through graphs and tables enables us to act in an efficient and timely manner. To create and configure the dashboard, we will use Grafana.</p><p>Grafana is an open-source tool, compatible with a wide range of databases (including InfluxDB), that presents a graphical representation of metrics and allows a user to create alerts if a particular piece of data meets a condition. For example, if your CPU reaches high peaks, you can be notified on Slack, Mattermost, by email, etc. In fact, I have personally configured an alert every time someone enters SSH, so I can actively monitor who “enters” my infrastructure.</p><p>Grafana does not require any special settings: once again, it is InfluxDB that “scans” the “time” variable. The integration is simple. Let’s start by import the public key to add the package from the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/download">Grafana official website</a> (it depends on the OS you are using):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b2c0ddddc6f2dcddd6d7">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

                    <blockquote>man muss immer umkehren - Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</blockquote><p>(loosely translated - Invert, always, invert)</p><p>Today, we will look at one of my favourite mental models called - The<strong><em> Inversion principle</em></strong>. <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/#what_are_mental_models">Mental models</a> are a set of simple, abstract but useful principles that help us make sense of the world around us.</p><p>I came across the Inversion principle on the <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/">Farnam Street blog</a>. It is also a favourite of Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffets mate) - "...it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward", he pontificates.</p><p>In another interview, he recalls how, as an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, instead of asking what would keep pilots safe, he asked what would kill them and focussed all his efforts "on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else.".</p><p>I could write a book on all the other cool stuff Charlie Munger has said so I'll stop here.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Inversion is based on the maxim - invert, always, invert. It is about considering an inverse (usually a negative) outcome and listing the reasons for these. It forces you to either stop doing certain things or avoid the actions that lead to the negative outcomes. It gives us <em><em>new possibilities</em> and capabilities</em> that we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>The algorithm for inversion is very simple:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the problem</strong> - what is it that &nbsp;you're trying to achieve?</li><li><strong>Invert it </strong>- what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?</li><li>Finally, <strong>consider solutions to avoid this failure</strong></li></ul><p>This is very abstract and vague, so let's look at a few examples:</p><ol><li>Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:</li></ol><ul><li>Slow load time i.e. performance issues</li><li>Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience</li><li>The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea</li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;Following the inversion principle it is <em>better to ask</em> what is preventing me from reading all the unread books on my kindle/bookshelf, instead of asking how can i read more books? Possible reasons and something you could give up:</p><ul><li>I spend a lot of time on social media</li><li>I watch too many shows on Netflix or Disney +</li><li>Spend a lot of time on reddit or browsing hacker news</li></ul><p>3. Instead of wondering how do I always choose a winning stock during investing, ask yourself how do you prevent losses in the long term?</p><ul><li>Am I diversifying enough to prevent long term loss?</li><li>Am I investing &nbsp;based on sound principles, or am I speculating? </li></ul><p>Hopefully this &nbsp;gives you a flavour of how powerful inversion is as a mental model. I should add that it is NOT a silver bullet and it won't always give you concrete answers, but it will act as a forcing function to avoid obvious lapses in judgment. I'll leave you with another one of my favourite quotes about Inversion from Charlie.</p><blockquote>"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."</blockquote><hr><p>Further reading:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/">Avoiding Stupidity is Easier than Seeking Brilliance</a></blockquote>

We take a closer look at what decision science says is the ‘best’ way to pursue this purpose.</p><p><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/favicon.png"><span>Commonplace - The Commoncog Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2018/12/burst-530182-unsplash--1-.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this post, if you found it useful and if you have any comments or more tips, please hit me up on twitter (@<a href="https://twitter.com/anup">anup</a>).</p>

	<p><small>July 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Many languages start running your program by calling a function of
yours that must have a specific name. In C (and many C derived
languages), this is just called <code>main()</code>; in Go, it's <code>main.main()</code>
(the <code>main()</code> function in the <code>main</code> package). Python famously
doesn't require any such function, and won't automatically call a
function called <code>main()</code> even if you create it. Recently I read
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">Why doesnâ€™t Python have a main function?</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function">via</a>),
which puts forward one discussion for why this is so. However, I have
a somewhat different way of explaining this situation.</p>

<p>The core reason that Python doesn't require a <code>main()</code> function is a
combination of its execution model (specifically for what happens when
you import something) and that under normal circumstances you start
Python programs by (implicitly) importing a single file of Python code.
So let's look at each of these parts.</p>

<p>In many languages things like functions, classes, and so on are
created (defined) by the interpreter or compiler as it parses the
source file. In Python, this is not quite the case; instead, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FunctionDefinitionOrder"><code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> are executable statements</a>,
and they define classes and functions when they execute (among other
things, this is part of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyMetaclassesWork">why metaclasses work</a>).
When Python imports something, it simply executes everything in the
file (or the import more generally). When what's executed is <code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> statements, you get functions and classes. When what's
executed is regular code, you get more complicated things happening,
including conditional imports or calling functions on the fly under
the right conditions. Or you can write an entire program that just
runs inline, as the file is imported.</p>

<p>(This has some interesting consequences, including <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ReloadRealBehavior">what reloading
a Python module really does</a>.)</p>

<p>However, Python is not quite as unique here as it might look. Many
languages have some facility to run arbitrary code early on as the
program is 'loading', before the program starts normal execution
(Go has <code>init()</code> functions, for example). Where Python is different
from these languages is that Python normally starts a program by
loading and executing a specific single file. Because Python is
only executing a single file, it's unambiguous what code is run in
what order and it's straightforward for the code in that file to
control what happens. In a sense, rather than picking an arbitrarily
named function for where execution (nominally) starts, Python is
able to sneakily pick an arbitrarily named file by having you provide
it.</p>

<p>(Compiled languages traditionally have a model where code from a bunch
of separate files is all sort of piled up together. In Python, you can't
really aggregate multiple files together into a shared namespace this
way; one way or another, you have to <code>import</code> them and everything starts
from some initial file.)</p>

<p>Where this nice model breaks down and needs a workaround is if you
run a package with '<code>python -m ...</code>', where Python doesn't really
have a single file that you're executing (or it'd have to make
<code>__init__.py</code> serve double duty). As covered in the official
documentation's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html"><code>__main__</code> â€” Top-level script environment</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function#c_jmer2v">via</a>),
Python adopts the arbitrary convention of loading a <code>__main__.py</code>
file from your package and declaring it more or less the point where
execution starts.</p>

<p>(Under at least some situations, your package's <code>__init__.py</code> may
also be executed.)</p>

<p>PS: contrary to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">the original article's views</a>,
<strong>I strongly suggest that you have a <code>main()</code> function</strong>, because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ImportableMain">there are significant benefits to keeping your program importable</a>.</p>

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ

I'm not going to talk about R7RS-large here. It's just too …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Some abstractions are ticking time bombs, while others help you move fast. How can you tell? What follows is my personal exploration for how I assess abstractions.</p><h2>Problem</h2><p>We add abstractions in our programs to solve problems. So, let’s start with the fundamental value proposition: what problem does our abstraction solve? </p><p>Let’s take a look at one example abstraction:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(...) // =&gt; { intent: "set_alarm", at: "1593538633430" }</code></pre><p>This could be a natural language processing abstraction, which lets us take a piece of text, and extract meaning from it. The inherent problem of natural language processing is pretty darn complex, so an abstraction that helps us solve it would be very valuable. This is a sign of a good abstraction.</p><p>Now let’s compare that to </p><pre><code>StringSplitter.easySplit(str, splitStr)</code></pre><p>Maybe this abstraction, adds a light layer on top of string.split. For example, it may make it so you don’t have to worry about regexes, and can turn common string patterns into regexes. The value of a <code>StringSplitter</code> abstraction is pretty darn low. Maybe  <code>StringSplitter</code> treats <code>splitStr</code> in a way that’s a bit more in-line with the someone’s thinking, but at the end of the day this boils down to an indirection. </p><p>This leads us to the first principle. The more complex the problem it solves for you, the better the abstraction (1).</p><h2>Interface</h2><p>After we’re convinced that the abstraction we are about to add solves a tough problem for us, the next thing to consider is the interface: <em>how</em> do we interact with the abstraction? Imagine if <code>NLP.parse</code> was called like this:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code></pre><p>This is a great interface. It’s small. We don’t need to understand any internals. For the main use-case, all we need to do is to provide language and text. Compare that with</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(
  text,
  lang, 
  strategy,
  shouldUseFlagA,
  ...
  shouldUseFlagZ
)</code></pre><p>In order to use this version, we’d need to deeply understand the internals of NLP.parse. This lowers the value of the abstraction, because we need to do more work to solve the same level of complexity. </p><p>This leads us to the second principle: <strong>great abstractions have small interfaces.</strong></p><h2>Breakthrough Cost</h2><p>Now that we have an abstraction with a simple interface that solves a hard problem, we need to ask a possibly fatal question: what happens when we need to break through the abstraction? </p><p>All abstractions are leaky at some point. What will happen when you need the abstraction to behave differently? What will happen when it doesn’t work as you expect? </p><p>For example, for <code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code>, what if we needed to sort and score the results differently? What if there’s a bug, and we aren’t getting the entity we expect, can we look through and debug?</p><p>Understanding the answer to this, will give us the breakthrough cost. To do this, we need to peak through the code. How is <code>NLP.parse</code> implemented?</p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  return format(scoreEntities(fetchEntities(lang, text)))
}</code></pre><p>In one solution, it could be composed of other abstractions that we can take advantage of. This is a great sign, because we can reuse the underlying abstractions in cases where we need to do something more complicated. Compare that to </p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  internalParse(lang, text, flagA, flagB, ...flagZ)
}</code></pre><p>This feels more dangerous. If these flags all head to the same function, it’s a sign that a bunch of different features are complected together. It’s also worrying: what if one of these flags don’t do what you want? you may have to fork the abstraction.</p><p>This leads us to the third principle: <strong>great abstractions are transparent.</strong> I think this principle is the most overlooked. It’s easy to take the productivity win upfront, but if the abstraction you add can’t be changed, and can’t be introspected, it’s very likely to bite you at some point.</p><h2>Generality</h2><p>The final principle is orthogonal to the last three, but maybe it’s the most important. Hardy said <em>there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics —</em> So it is with abstractions. The beauty in math relates to how “general” and “tight” the solution is. I think this parallels well with abstractions. </p><p>If you use an abstraction that is “essentially” simpler, it’s more likely to last, and it’s likely to be more powerful.</p><p>Consider if the abstraction for <code>NLP</code>, was made up of specific algorithms, <em>just</em> for natural language processing. This would still be very valuable, but what would be <em>even more</em> valuable, is if the abstractions that this library was composed of was more general: if the parts that compose it were deep learning abstractions, you could reuse them for other problems.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>And we reach the end. To pick great abstractions: pick the ones that solve a complex problem for you. Make sure they have a simple interface, and take a look at the internals, so you’re confident you can jig things up if needed. The more general and simple you can get for the same amount of power, the better. </p><p>Want to see some great abstractions in the wild? First, chances are you are using many of them: TCP, higher order functions like map &amp; filter, React. Some you may not have explored: Go’s CSP, Rich Hickey’s Datomic, or his <code>seq</code> abstraction in Clojure. As you pick up abstractions, I encourage you to run each one as an experiment: ask yourself at the end how things went, discuss them with your friends, and soon you’ll develop a much more nuanced taste.</p><p>(1) The rabbit hole gets deeper. Even if an abstraction solves a complex problem you have, you may need to take a step back and also ask: why do I have this problem? For example, kubernetes may be a great solution to building distributed systems, but why do you have a distributed systems problem? Many times the problem itself can be avoided. For the answer to that, <a href="https://stopa.io/post/241" target="_blank">Hacker’s Paradise</a> tries to covers it.</p><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Martin Raison, Sean Grove for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

I’ll try to keep it up to date as I think of more.</p><p>(Some of them are extremely well-known. I’m leaving them here anyway just in case you’re one of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/" target="_blank">the lucky 10,000</a>.)</p><p>I’m curious what essays are in this category for other folks—post yours in the comments!</p><hr><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/" target="_blank">Computers can be understood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I approach software with a deep-seated belief that computers and software systems can be understood. …</p><p>In some ways, this belief feels radical today. Modern software and hardware systems contain almost unimaginable complexity amongst many distinct layers, each building atop each other. …</p><p>In the face of this complexity, it’s easy to assume that there’s just too much to learn, and to adopt the mental shorthand that the systems we work with are best treated as black boxes, not to be understood in any detail.</p><p>I argue against that approach. You will never understand every detail of the implementation of every level on that stack; but you can understand all of them to some level of abstraction, and any specific layer to essentially any depth necessary for any purpose.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank">Choose Boring Technology</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while. You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity, but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet. Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps.</p><p>If you choose to write your website in NodeJS, you just spent one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to use MongoDB, you just spent one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to use service discovery tech that’s existed for a year or less, you just spent one of your innovation tokens.

Alex was the one who nonced.</p><p>A few years ago, Matasano couldn’t have hired Alex, because we relied on interviews and resumes to hire. Then we made some changes, and became a machine that spotted and recruited people like Alex: line of business .NET developers at insurance companies who pulled Rails core CVEs out of their first hour looking at the code. Sysadmins who hardware-reversed assembly firmware for phone chipsets. Epiphany: the talent is out there, but you can’t find it on a resume.</p><p>Our field selects engineers using a process that is worse than reading chicken entrails.

Earlier for the sake of simplicity I told a little fib, and some of you have steam coming out of your ears by now because this fib is driving you crazy. I said that TCP guarantees that your message will arrive. It doesn’t, actually. If your pet snake has chewed through the network cable leading to your computer, and no IP packets can get through, then TCP can’t do anything about it and your message doesn’t arrive. If you were curt with the system administrators in your company and they punished you by plugging you into an overloaded hub, only some of your IP packets will get through, and TCP will work, but everything will be really slow.</p><p>This is what I call a leaky abstraction. TCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable network, but sometimes, the network leaks through the abstraction and you feel the things that the abstraction can’t quite protect you from. This is but one example of what I’ve dubbed the Law of Leaky Abstractions:</p><p><strong>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</strong></p><p>Abstractions fail. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. There’s leakage. Things go wrong. It happens all over the place when you have abstractions.

Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways.

Just like the transaction, an HTTP request is a transactional unit of work – it’s got a clear beginning, end, and result. The client generally expects a request to execute atomically and will behave as if it will (although that of course varies based on implementation). Here we’ll look at an example service to see how HTTP requests and transactions apply nicely to one another.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In APIs <em>idempotency</em> is a powerful concept. An idempotent endpoint is one that can be called any number of times while guaranteeing that the side effects will occur only once. In a messy world where clients and servers that may occasionally crash or have their connections drop partway through a request, it’s a huge help in making systems more robust to failure.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>There’s a famous thinking framework by ‘futurist’, ‘forecaster’, and scenario consultant Paul Saffo called ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. The phrase itself became popular in tech circles in the 2010s — I remember reading about it on Hacker News or a16z.com or one of those thinky tech blogs around the period. It’s still rather popular today.</p><p>Saffo’s framework — laid out in his original <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">2008 blog post</a> — goes like this:</p><blockquote>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.<p>Since the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</p><p>This process is equally useful for evaluating an already-final forecast in the face of new information. It sensitizes one to the weak signals of changes coming over the horizon and keeps the hapless forecaster from becoming so attached to their model that reality intrudes too late to make a difference.</p><p>More generally, “strong opinions weakly held” is often a useful default perspective to adopt in the face of any issue fraught with high levels of uncertainty, whether one is venturing a forecast or not. Try it at a cocktail party the next time a controversial topic comes up; it is an elegant way to discover new insights — and duck that tedious bore who loudly knows nothing but won’t change their mind!</p></blockquote><p>On the face of it, it all sounds very reasonable and smart. And ‘strong opinions weakly held’ is such a catchy phrase — which probably explains its popularity.</p><p>The only problem with it is that it doesn’t seem to work that well.</p><h2 id="swimming-upstream-against-the-architecture-of-the-mind">Swimming Upstream Against the Architecture Of The Mind</h2><p>How do I know that it doesn’t work that well? I know this because I’ve tried. I tried to use Saffo’s framework in the years between 2013 and 2016, and when I was running my previous company I attempted it with my boss, whenever we convened to <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">discuss company strategy</a>.</p><p>Eventually I read Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, and then I gave up on ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’.</p><p>Why does the framework not work very well? From experience, Saffo’s approach fails in two ways.</p><p>The first way is if the person <em>hasn’t</em> read Saffo’s original post. This is, to be fair, most of us — Saffo’s original idea is so quotable it has turned into a memetic phenomenon, and I’ve seen it cited in fields far outside tech. In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.’</p><p>In simpler terms, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ sometimes becomes a license to hold on to a bad opinion strongly, with downside protection, against the spirit and intent of Saffo’s original framework.</p><p>Now, you might say that this is through no fault of Saffo’s, and is instead the problem of popularity. But my response is that if an idea has certain affordances, and people seem to always grab onto those affordances and abuse the idea in the exact same ways, then <em>perhaps you shouldn’t use the idea in the first place.</em> This is especially true — as we’re about to see — if there are better ideas out there.</p><p>The second form of failure is if the person has taken the time to look up the original intention of the phrase. In this situation, the failure mode is when you attempt to integrate new information into your judgment. Saffo’s framework offers no way for us to do this.</p><p>Here’s an example. Let’s say that you’ve decided, along with your boss, to build a particular type of product for a particular subsection of the self-service checkout market. You both come to the opinion that this subsection is the best entry-point to the industry: it is relatively lucrative, and you think that it is the easiest customer segment to service.</p><p>What happens to your opinion when you <em>slowly</em> discover that the subsegment is overcrowded? Of course, you don’t find out immediately — what happens instead is that you spot little hints, spread over the course of a couple of months, that many competitors are entering the market at the same time. These are tiny things like competitor brochures lying in the corner table of a client’s office, or pronouncements by industry groups that “they are looking to engage vendors for large deployments”, and then much later, clearer evidence in the form of increased competition in deals.</p><p>“Well,” I can hear you say, “‘Strong opinions weakly held’ means that you should change your opinion when you encounter these tiny hints!”</p><p>But at which point do you change your mind? At which point do you switch away from your strong opinion? At which point do you think that it’s time to reconsider your approach?</p><p>The problem, of course, is that <em>this is not how the human brain works.</em></p><p>Both forms of failure stem from the same tension. It’s easy to have strong opinions and hold on to them strongly. It’s easy to have weak opinions and hold on to them weakly. But it is quite difficult for the human mind to vacillate between one strong opinion to another.</p><p>I don’t mean to say that people <em>can’t</em> do this — only that it is very difficult to do so. For instance, Steve Jobs was famous for arguing against one position or another, only to decide that you were right, and then come back a month later holding exactly your opinion, as if it were his all along.</p><p>But most people aren’t like Jobs. Psychologist Amos Tversky used to joke that by default, human brains fall back to “yes I believe that, no I don’t believe that, and maybe” — a three-dial setting when it comes to uncertainty. People then hold on to their opinion for as long as their internal narratives allow them to. Saffo’s thinking framework implies that you sit in ‘yes I believe that’ territory, and then rapidly switch away to ‘maybe’ or to ‘no’, depending on the information you receive.</p><p>Perhaps you may — like Jobs! — be able to do this. But if you are like most people, the attempt will feel a lot like whiplash.</p><p>So, you might ask, what to do instead?</p><h2 id="use-probability-as-an-expression-of-confidence">Use Probability as an Expression of Confidence</h2><p>The gentler answer lies in <em>Superforecasting.</em> In the book, Tetlock presents an analytical framework that is easier to use than Saffo’s, while achieving many of the same goals.</p><ol><li>When forming an opinion, phrase it in a way that is very clear, and may be verified by a particular date.</li><li>Then state the probability you are confident that it is correct.</li></ol><p>For instance, you may say “I believe that Tesla will go bankrupt by 31 December 2021, and I am about 76% confident that this is the case.” Or you can be slightly sloppier with the technique — with my boss, I would say: “I think this subsegment is a good market to enter, and I think we would know if this is true within four months. I believe this on the order of 70% ish. Let’s check back in September.”</p><p>(My boss was an ex-investment banker, so he took to this like a duck to water.)</p><p>Tetlock’s stated technique was developed in the context of a geopolitical forecasting tournament called the Good Judgment Project. In 2016, when I read <em>Superforecasting</em> for the first time, I remember thinking that geopolitical forecasting wasn’t particularly relevant to my job running an engineering office in Vietnam. But I also glommed onto the book’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-the-superforecasters-do-it/">ideas around analysis</a>, because it was too attractive to ignore.</p><p>The truth is that Tetlock’s ideas are not unique to his research group. Annie Duke’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em> proposes the same approach, but drawn from poker, and the ‘rationalist’ community <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> has long-held norms around stating the confidence of their opinions.</p><p>More importantly, Duke and LessWrong have both discovered that the <em>fastest</em> way to provoke such nuanced thinking is to ask: “Are you willing to bet on that? What odds would you take, and how much?”</p><p>You’d be surprised by how effective this question is.</p><p>Why is it so effective? Why does it succeed where ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ does not?</p><p>The answer lies in the ‘strong opinion’ portion of the phrase. First: by forcing you to state your opinion as a probability judgment — that is, a percentage — you are forced to calibrate the strength of your belief. This makes it easier to move away from it. In other words, you are forced to let go of the ‘yes, no, maybe’ dial in your head.</p><p>Second: by framing it as a bet, you suddenly have skin in the game, and are motivated to get things right.</p><p>Of course, you don’t actually <em>have</em> to bet — you can merely propose the bet as a thinking frame. Later, as new information trickles in, you are allowed to update the % confidence you have in your belief. This allows you to see the world in shades of grey; it also allows you to communicate that confidence to those around you.</p><h2 id="revisiting-the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence">Revisiting The Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</h2><p>I have one final point to make about this approach.</p><p>Long term readers of this blog would know that my shtick is “apply a technique to my career or to my life, over the period of a couple of months, and report on its efficacy.” Over time, I’ve noticed that techniques are more likely to be effective when they come from believable practitioners. This is what led to my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-practical-evidence/">Hierarchy of Practical Evidence</a>.</p><p>Saffo’s and Tetlock’s …</p></section></div>
