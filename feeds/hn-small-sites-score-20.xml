<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>

                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>

<p>The following draft is concerned with the curious use of the nickname 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish between around 1815 and the First World War saw what has been termed the 'wholescale scattering' of the Cornish to the new mining frontiers of North and South America, Australia and South Africa. From at least the mid-nineteenth century, these emigrants were known as 'Cousin Jacks', but the origin of this term seems rather obscure. The aim of the following note is to investigate the evidence for the early usage of the term 'Cousin Jack' and make some suggestions as to its origins in light of this evidence.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s952/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg"><img data-original-height="952" data-original-width="806" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQtckgdORQ0/YAmWCnM8nfI/AAAAAAADP2I/SjbyinJIJ6QT1a5SiULZKMsl4eStLMsowCLcBGAsYHQ/w339-h400/cousin-jack-cover-pryor.jpg" width="424"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The cover of Oswald Pryor's <i>Cousin Jack Cartoons</i>&nbsp;(Sydney, 1945); Pryor was the son of Cornish parents and born at Moonta, South Australia. The books says the following of the front cover image: 'The cover design suggests a miner who has knocked off early, and has come up a ladderway remote from the main shaft in order to avoid running into the boss. Unfortunately he has run into the trouble he meant to avoid. This situation will be, obvious to all who know the Moonta scene. —The miner's hat here depicted is made of hard compressed pulp and colored a deep maroon when new. The candle is stuck on the front of the hat with a lump of wet red clay. This was the practice of old Cornish miners for generations.' (Image: <a href="http://search.slv.vic.gov.au/primo-explore/fulldisplay?vid=MAIN&amp;docid=SLV_VOYAGER951330&amp;context=L">State Library of Victoria</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 'Great Emigration' of the Cornish in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries seems to have occurred on a quite remarkable scale. Margaret James-Korany has, for example, identified 42,000 individual emigrants sailing from the principal ports of Cornwall for Canada between 1831 and 1860, with some 6,200 leaving from Padstow alone in that period, and this outflow continued long after 1860 too. Thus the&nbsp;<i>Cornish Telegraph</i>&nbsp;for 5 September 1866 published a piece regretting 'the rage for emigration' in recent years, noting that 'the rush for Australia and America has been very great', and recent calculations suggest that at least 240,000 Cornish went overseas between 1860 and 1900, with a similar number leaving for England and Wales, with the result that Cornwall lost around a third of its population across the period. This depopulation was particularly marked amongst the youngest age-groups. Philip Payton observes that 44.8% of the Cornish male population aged fifteen to twenty-four left for overseas between 1861 and 1900, along with 26.2% of the female population in the same age group, and another 30% and 35.5% respectively left for other counties within Britain as well.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn1">1</a>)</p><p>The use of the term 'Cousin Jack' for the Cornish, particularly miners and especially emigrant miners, along with its companion-term 'Cousin Jenny', is well-evidenced from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. John H. Forster's account of 'Life in the copper mines of Lake Superior', given to the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society in 1887, contains the following illustrative passage:</p><blockquote><p>The Cornishman, or "<b><u>cousin Jack</u></b>," is a native of the duchy of Cornwall, England... The Cornishman of the present day, like his father, is of a roving disposition. His footsteps may be traced around the globe. There is no prominent mining field in the world wherein you will not find "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>." He is in Alaska, California, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, Central and South America, in Australia, India and Lake Superior. He is a first rate miner and possesses a certain sturdiness of frame and disposition that commends him to the observer. He works hard, eats well and fights bravely. He is, numerically, very strong in our northern mines, and, being, as a rule, steady, conservative and skillful, he finds ready employment. He likes mining; esteems his vocation among the most honorable, if not aristocratic. He despises the duties of an ordinary day laborer. In short, he is a born miner and nothing else... But "<b><u>Cousin Jack</u></b>'s" language attracts most attention. His dialect, pure and simple, is unique. He uses many English words with a strange twist, while other words of his you would look for in vain in Webster's unabridged... But we find in the mines many gentlemen of Cornish birth who are well educated and efficient, occupying positions of trust and responsibility. Many of the captains and agents are Cornishmen.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn2">2</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Quite when and where these Cornish emigrants started to be known as 'Cousin Jacks' is not wholly clear, unfortunately, and various theories have been proposed over the years, most of which locate the genesis of the term overseas in America, Australia or other places where Cornish miners emigrated to in the nineteenth century. The&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times</i>&nbsp;in 1908, for example, carried a piece suggesting that the term 'Cousin Jack' was first used in the California mining districts in the very late 1840s and spread out from there, with the additional claim that 'twenty years ago the term in Cornwall was unknown'; however, as we shall see, neither claim stands up to scrutiny, and the reality is perhaps even more interesting.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1241/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="1241" data-original-width="1000" height="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exfrGNkOVqo/YAmYpHYdTWI/AAAAAAADP2Y/L6Bvc2jy2Y4RFtBUXCGSsaP6B6uryfqNgCLcBGAsYHQ/w323-h400/nla.obj-133090696-1.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td>An Australian Cousin Jack cartoon by Oswald Pryor from 1915; the caption reads 'Cousin Jack miner:- "Call isself Cap'n 'e do; and I 'spoase ef the truth ez known, 'e never did a day's work underground in all 'ez life."' (Image: <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-133090696/view">Trove</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the documentary evidence for the usage of the term, a traditional place to start is with the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, which&nbsp;cites a number of examples of the use of Cousin Jack under their <i>Cousin, n.</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jack, n.¹</i>&nbsp;entries. One, from Rolf Boldrewood's Australian novel&nbsp;<i>Miner's Right</i>&nbsp;of 1890, describes 'a short man, whose blue-black curly hair and deep-set eyes betrayed the Cousin Jack',(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn4">4</a>) whilst the earliest given is from&nbsp;<i>The Star</i> newspaper&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ballarat, Victoria (Australia) on the 19 March 1857, which runs as follows:</p><blockquote><p>They were ‘Tips’, and ‘Geordies’, and ‘<b><u>Cousin Jacks</u></b>’, altogether, and I did as well as I could.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn5">5</a>)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The fact that both of the early citations are from Australia has sometimes been taken to suggest that the term could have emerged there, and it is certainly treated as such by the <i>English Dialect Dictionary</i>&nbsp;under&nbsp;its entry for&nbsp;<i>Cousin</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn6">6</a>) In addition to these entries, the <i>OED </i>also records what it treats as a variant of Cousin Jack, <i>Cousin Jacky.</i> This is said to be documented first in the <i>South Australian Register</i>, from Adelaide,<i>&nbsp;</i>for 2 June 1854, via the following passage: 'John O'Connell then said to him, ‘You're a b——, <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>, an't you?'', although the term also occurs in dialogue from Australian court reports of the 1840s too, <i>e.g.</i> 'I don't like <b><u>you cousin Jackies</u></b>, keep your own company, and I'll keep mine', which appeared in the&nbsp;<i>South Australian</i>, 30 May 1848.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn7">7</a>) However, 'Cousin Jacky' is not only documented in Australian contexts; it also appears in, for example, Thomas Quiller Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words</i>, published by the English Dialect Society in 1880, where it is treated as an East Cornwall term for a miner from West Cornwall:</p><blockquote><p>There is a marked difference between the speech of East and West Cornwall... At the beginning of the present century mining adventure, especially in the search for copper, became a furor in East Cornwall, and a passionate enthusiasm brought hither the skilled miners of the West, who flocked to the banks of Tywardreath Bay, and further east to the central granite ridge about the tors of Caradon. These immigrants brought with them and have left an infusion of their language, especially its technical portion, but I remember when it was a great mimetic feat, and productive of much mirth amongst us, to be able to imitate the talk of <b><u>Cousin Jacky</u></b>&nbsp;from Redruth or St. Just.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn8">8</a>)</p></blockquote><p>T. Q. Couch of Bodmin, the father of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch (aka Q), was born in 1826 at Lansallos near Fowey, and seems to be here recounting a usage known to him in his youth, and is clearly referring to someone from West Cornwall, not a Cornish emigrant overseas. Likewise, in a letter printed in the&nbsp;<i>West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser</i> for 28 March 1862, Christopher Childs of Liskeard uses 'Cousin Jacky' in passing as a seemingly well-known, common and friendly term traditionally used between Cornish miners:</p><blockquote><p>The very motto of the Cornish miners, "One and All," at once bespeaks our favour, and indicates that [Cornish miners] are not naturally selfish, but on the contrary, are kindly disposed one toward another. If any one doubt this, let him attend the funeral of a miner, and observe how they congregate to pay the last sad tribute of respect, and drop a tear over the grave of their departed comrade... How forcibly does the familiar name "comrade," and the expression of "<b><u>Com'se along Cousin Jacky</u></b>," speak in favour of his friendly and social disposition.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn9">9</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In contrast, in Margaret Ann Courtney's <i>West Cornwall Words</i>&nbsp;(which was bound together with Couch's <i>East Cornwall Words&nbsp;</i>of 1880), 'Cousin Jacky' features as&nbsp;a local dialect term meaning 'a foolish person, a coward', with 'Cousin Jan' instead being given as the name for Cornishman—the latter variant is discussed further below, as is the former definition for Cousin Jacky.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/s1162/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1162" height="370" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xpy9aMOhrE8/YAmsAmjnqOI/AAAAAAADP3M/MB2xsu27hYkyWoIx53xnp4DtipZEHK_CACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h296/CornishGhostStory1862.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>The first two pages of Elfin's <i>A Cornish Ghost Story</i>, first published at Truro sometime before 1862; these two pages are taken from an 1868 edition of the text in <i>Cornish Tales in Prose and Verse</i>&nbsp;(Truro: Netherton, 1868), pp. 37<span>–</span>8 (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/cornishpales00treggoog/page/n243/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Needless to say, the above references do seem to cast serious doubt upon the implication of the report in the&nbsp;<i>Cornubian and Redruth Times&nbsp;</i>in 1908 that the term 'Cousin Jack' and similar was unknown in Cornwall in the late 1880s, and in this light it is worth noting that Sharron Schwartz has, in fact, suggested that the 'evidence seems to point to the mines of Devonshire in the eighteenth century' as the place where the term Cousin Jack originated, via migrant Cornish miners seeking work in Devon rather than overseas.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/cousin-jack-origins.html#fn11">11</a>) Although she unfortunately offers no citation to …</p></div></div>

          <p>A few months ago I experimented with DigitalOcean spaces as my backup solution that could <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">replace Dropbox eventually</a>. That solution worked quite nicely, and I was amazed how smashing together a couple of existing solutions would work this fine.</p>
<p>I have been running that solution in the background for a couple of months now and kind of forgot about it. But recent developments around deplatforming and having us people hostages of technology and big companies speed up my goals to become less dependent on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048680/dropbox-takes-a-peek-at-files.html">Dropbox</a> etc and take back some control.</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theory nut, but to be honest, what these companies are doing lately is out of control. It is a matter of principle at this point. I have almost completely degoogled my life all the way from ditching Gmail, YouTube and most of the services surrounding Google. And I must tell you, I feel so good. I haven't felt this way for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways. Let's get to the meat of things.</strong></p>
<p>Before you continue you should read my post about <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">syncing to Dropbox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to note, I am using Linux on my machine with Gnome desktop environment. This should work on MacOS too. To use this on Windows I suggest using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Subsystem for Linux</a> or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>I liked structure from Dropbox. One folder where everything is located and synced. So, that's why adopted this also for my sync setup.</p>
<pre><code>~/Vault
   ↳ backup
   ↳ bin
   ↳ documents
   ↳ projects
</code></pre>
<p>All of my code is located in <code>~/Vault/projects</code> folder. And most of the projects are Git repositories. I do not use this sync method for backup per see but in case I reinstall my machine I can easily recreate all the important folder structure with one quick command. No external drives needed that can fail etc.</p>
<h2 id="sync-script">Sync script</h2>
<p>My sync script is located in <code>~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &lt; tilix.dconf
# 0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh

cd ~/Vault/backup/dotfiles

MACHINE=$(whoami)@$(hostname)
mkdir -p $MACHINE
cd $MACHINE

cp ~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json settings.json
cp ~/.s3cfg s3cfg
cp ~/.bash_extended bash_extended
cp ~/.ssh ssh -rf

codium --list-extensions &gt; vscode-extension.txt
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &gt; tilix.dconf

cd ~/Vault
s3cmd sync --delete-removed --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.venv/*' ./ s3://bucket-name/backup/

echo `date +"%D %T"` &gt;&gt; ~/.vault.log

notify-send \
	-u normal \
	-i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/96x96/status/security-medium-symbolic.symbolic.png \
	"Vault sync succeded at `date +"%D %T"`"
</code></pre>
<p>This script also backups some of the dotfiles I use and sends notification to Gnome notification center. It is a straightforward solution. Nothing special going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious benefit of this is that I can omit syncing Node's <code>node_modules</code> or Python's <code>.venv</code> and <code>.git</code> folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use this script in a combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>When you start syncing your local stuff with a remote server you can review your items on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p><img src="https://mitjafelicijan.com/assets/dropbox-sync/dropbox-spaces.png" alt="Dropbox Spaces"></p>
<p>I have been using this script now for quite some time, and it's working flawlessly. I also uninstalled Dropbox and stopped using it completely.</p>
<p>All I need to do is write a Bash script that does the reverse and downloads from remote server to local folder. This could be another post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>UPDATE: Since this blew up 1. I wrote this mostly in response <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">this article in Bloomberg</a>. 2. If you want to follow me on Twitter for more hot takes on internet culture and marketing stuff you can do that here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JeromySonne">@jeromysonne</a></p>



<p>I want to preface all of this by saying I am not an investing expert. I currently hold no publicly traded companies’ stock. (Though I might I haven’t logged into Robinhood in a while). What I am pretty good at though is internet culture and understanding communities through that lens. I also don’t agree with the Wallstreetbets culture. I’m just trying to explain it.</p>



<p>The recent dramatic fall and meteoric rise of Gamestop via the short squeeze that happened has a lot of technical reasons that people a lot better at finance can explain. What keeps coming up though is Wallstreetbets and their hand in taking a stock that seemed doomed to failure and rocketing it to new heights. I’m seeing a lot of well-meaning takes on their role that generally miss the “why” of the community and what it does / how it exists. After reading a well-written article in Bloomberg (that ultimately misses the point on WSB). I thought I would take a moment to give some insights.</p>



<p>References to tendies, autism, gay bears, and a bunch of other things don’t really make a lot of sense on the surface (and some make even less sense once you dive in). The culture of Wallstreetbets is an interesting one, to say the least, that has a lot of its language and customs rooted in 4chan. As 4chan users have grown up, migrated to other corners of the internet, and spread their language it’s continued on and evolved in different spaces. You saw a lot of this with the_donald on Reddit a few years ago before it was banned and a lot of similar overlap in language between what the community was and what WSB is now. (Twitter is so late to the party compared to Reddit).</p>



<p>The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism. Since they are basement dwellers their obvious food of choice is chicken tenders aka tendies that they trade in their GBPs (Good boy points) to their mom so they can get more. In this world, they earn good boy points by doing well at stocks.</p>



<p>On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men. That nothing really means anything, that no one cares about them (or in some cases actively hate them), and so they reject buying in on the society they feel actively scorns them. I’ll resist the urge to add my personal opinions or quote Fight Club here, but I’m mostly saying all this to get you in their head.</p>



<p>As someone that deals with some (in the grand scheme of things minor) mental health issues around panic attacks and anxiety attacks the “Fuck it if nothing means anything I may as well do what I want” attitude on a self-destructive and nihilistic level makes sense to me. It’s not logical but it makes sense. If nothing means anything you may as well do what you want and try and have some fun before the existential crisis of death takes us all. To do that though you need cash, and most of us are slammed with student debt, increased COL, and stagnant wages as compared to our parents’ generation. All the “boomer” advice we’re given doesn’t really make sense especially when it comes to the dreaded value investing that we’re told to do when it comes to stocks especially in light of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>



<p>See back in the day if you played the rules, worked the job, saved the money you could mostly live a pretty good life. The system was there and it had your back you just had to play by the rules. At some point that changed. Understanding that fundamentally you can do “everything right” and be totally fucked anyways, never able to achieve your dreams regardless of what you do or don’t do is a shitty feeling. Along comes WSB.</p>



<p>Suddenly, there’s a chance. Not a big one, but a chance to get out of your situation and live the life you want. You can do everything right and never be able to retire anyway, OR you can take super speculative positions in the stock market by making giant bets on risky options that, if you happen to be right, could make you rich. You’ve broken the cycle and you can live the life you want. Worst case? You’re right back where you started.</p>



<p>““<strong>If you owe</strong>&nbsp;your bank a hundred pounds,&nbsp;<strong>you have a problem</strong>. But&nbsp;<strong>if you owe</strong>&nbsp;a million,&nbsp;<strong>it</strong>&nbsp;has.” – Big Daddy Keyne$</p>



<p>I think there are really 2 things you need to understand about WSB (And really this piece of internet culture in general). It’s 50% depression and 50% a Molotov cocktail. You either win and get out or you lose AND you’re sticking it to the man at the same time. Even if I go super long, ratchet up the leverage, and take a big bet and lose guess what?</p>



<p>Nothing.</p>



<p>Seriously nothing. Most of these people are in hopeless debt with no clear path out anyway. They declare bankruptcy and move on. They took the bet, rode the adrenaline rush, and they lost. The silver lining? The elites that hate them are stuck paying the bill. It’s really a win-win situation. The memes, the culture, all of it really stems from this attitude.</p>



<p>I think it’s honestly fascinating that people are finally starting to notice this sub-culture once it’s begun affecting the mainstream financial system. Maybe now that it’s hitting these folks where they live, hurting the only thing they care about, they’ll start thinking about why these people are acting out. Before anyone accuses me of being a socialist I have a startup that sells <a href="https://decibelads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio ads called Decibel</a>. I’m a died in the wool capitalist and I can plainly see these issues. That maybe if they felt they had more of a stake in the future, that wealth inequality wasn’t so bad, that they’ll never afford a home, etc. they wouldn’t feel the need to act out. That if they weren’t in such an unwinnable situation they wouldn’t feel the need to throw Molotov cocktails through the front window of the country and the global financial system.</p>



<p>I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>



<p>Until then this is going to get worse, not better.</p>

<p>Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Port Sation, Florida — SpaceX made history again by sending a record number of 143 satellites on a single mission to the lower Earth orbit yesterday. The record was previously held by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with 103 satellites on a single launch.</p>



<p>Among these were 10 SpaceX Starlink satellites that are deployed to the Polar Orbit (see animation below for explanation). This will make high-speed internet available in the most remote polar locations of our planet.</p>



<p>The SmallSat rideshare program by SpaceX enables customers in launching their satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) with a budget as low as $1M. In this dedicated launch, most of the small satellites were of SpaceX customers, in the past, SpaceX has been making space for a small number of customer satellites with the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/falcon-9-starlink-launch-58/">Starlink constellation satellites.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s space exploration &amp; commercial spaceflight company has used optical laser-linking of the satellites for the first time. Musk has confirmed on Twitter that the black pipe-type objects at the end of each Starlink satellite are actually laser links. I have marked these objects in the following photo of the SmallSat satellite stack photo shared by SpaceX before the launch.</p>

<p>According to Musk, only the polar <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> satellites sent to orbit this year will have laser links, all the other Starlink satellites will get laser-linking feature next year. SpaceX has given the current laser-linked satellites a version number of v0.9, Musk explained.</p>

<h2>Why Laser Links?</h2>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snoshy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/snoshy</a> provided much-needed insight on the use of ‘laser links’ on Starlink satellites as the article made it to the HN front page.</p>



<blockquote><p>These laser links are purely intended for satellite-to-satellite communications for Starlink. They are not (at least at this time, and for the foreseeable future) intended for ground-to-satellite communications.</p><p>The value that sat-to-sat laser links provide is that they create a low latency, high bandwidth path that stays within the Starlink satellite network. Before these 10 satellites, each Starlink satellite has only been capable of communicating directly to ground terminals (either consumer, transit or SpaceX control). For traffic that is intended to move large geographic distances (think transcontinental), this can require several hops back and forth between ground and space, or the traffic from the user terminal is exited at a node that is geared for transiting traffic and most of the data transits along with existing ground Internet links.</p><p>By performing this type of transit directly in space, and exiting at a transit node nearest the destination for the data, you greatly reduce latency. Bandwidth still might not be great, but what this does is unlocks a very financially lucrative consumer use case: low latency finance traffic and critical communications. </p><p>There are many use cases around the world where shaving even 10-20 milliseconds of latency on a data path can unlock finance and emergency capabilities, and this is a long-fought battle throughout the history of these industries.

                    <h2 id="the-case-for-buying-an-expensive-pair-of-headphones">The case for buying an expensive pair of headphones</h2><p>Like many of us, I found myself working from home at the start of the pandemic. Initially I set myself up in the sitting room but as things progressed to the semi-permanent, we got rid of the office for my startup <a href="https://ruffly.com/">Ruffly</a> and I decided to move somewhere that wasn't stealing another space from the rest of the family.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>My wonderful wife works from home permanently in a home office and I could have moved in beside her. However, she has a tendendency to break into loud peals of laughter during conference calls which I find endearing through a closed door but has a high possibility of leading to divorce from 2 feet away.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

</li>
</ol>
</section>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The place chosen in our house was the upstairs landing. A space that already had a desk and chair that had been set up with a computer in an observable place for the kids to use, back when we niavely thought, pre-pandemic, that we would be rationing screen time for them.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> This space is exposed to the comings and goings of 3 children, the dog Dougal and my aforementioned wife. It is open to the main hallway of the house which has a wooden floor. All the doors in our house are Edwardian and make a terrifyingly loud <em>ka-thunk</em> when they close. I have line-of-sight down the stairs into the kitchen, a room which has the capacity to produce an array of metallic sounds that frankly astonish me - more on these later. All this to say, this is not a naturally quiet space.</p>

</section>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After the first lock-down ended and the children were packed off back to their incubation pods at school, life got tolerably quiet and I was able to worry about more minor auditory annoyances in life. The cupula above our hallway has an airgap for some reason, and it lets in the dull hubbub of the primary school playground next door. I spent an uncomfortable weekend up a ladder, filling the gaps with a noise insulating expanding foam.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Despite this, I gradually started to wonder if Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones of some sort might be a good answer for working from this new space.</p>
<hr>
<section>
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>This worked, in the sense that while it only cut out about 10% of the noise, it made me feel 100% better for having tried it <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In December 2020, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/">Airpods Max</a> and reviewers started waxing lyrical about how amazing these (extremely expensive) new ANC headphones from Apple truly were. As an Apple-eco-system stalwart, I considered that if I was going to spend <em>hundreds</em> of pounds on a pair of great ANC headphones, it might as well be <em>a couple more hundreds</em> of pounds for an <em>Apple</em> pair of headphones that would a) give the best performance and b) "just work" with all my Apple kit. As threats of a second school lock-down came to fruition I bit the bullet and ordered a pair.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>At this point its worth stating what I was <em>hoping</em> for from the Airpods Max, in priority order:</p><ol><li>Headphone noise cancellation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants coming to my ears</li><li>Microphone voice isolation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants reaching the ears of participants on video calls</li><li>Good-to-great sound quality of my voice on video calls</li><li>Great sound quality for listening to music while working</li></ol><h2 id="most-of-what-has-been-written-about-the-airpods-max-is-true">Most of what has been written about the Airpods Max is true</h2><p>The headphones arrived the second full week of January, a week before my wife and I had to start home-schooling the kids again but a time when both of us were back juggling full-time jobs with minding our 6, 8 and 10 year olds, plus the 10 month old puppy. </p><p>I'm not going to say much about the good bits of the Airpods Max because plenty has already been written on that. They do sound really great for music and for films. The most noticable thing to me was the way they project the sound in front of me when I'm listening to a normal stereo video on Youtube/Twitter/TikTok etc on the iPhone. It comes across as a very definite sound projection of about 30cms. I wouldn't say I like it especially more, but it's definitely a thing.</p><p>The ANC is exceptionally good at cutting out background noise. It fades it when you turn it on and I love the effect - it brings to mind a sound <em>animation</em>. I have subsequently tried a pair of Bose NC 700s and I can categorically say that the ANC on the Airpods Max is more effective at cutting out the normal background noise in my house.</p><p>However, as implied by the title, this isn't an article with a happy ending. In the end I had to send the Airpods Max back to Apple for a refund because they were four things that just did not work out for my use case. Without further ado, here they are...</p><h2 id="the-noise-cancellation-sucked">The noise cancellation sucked</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's tak about that ANC again. The use of 'sucked' in the title isn't (just) click-bait. The very first thing I noticed about the Airpods Max was that the ANC didn't feel great in my ears. I'd describe it as like the feeling you have when you need to repressurise your ears on an airplane. It doesn't bother you particularly at the time but when you swallow you realise it feels better. Taking off the Airpods Max felt like returning my inner ears to their natural, unadorned state. When I posted this on Twitter, @madmax helpfully pointed me to <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved">an article</a> about <em>Eardrum Suck</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> which I'm inclined to believe is the issue here. The ANC effect is very good at filtering out background noise, but it definitely <em>feels</em> like an effect.</p>

</section>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>And then there is event noise. Event noise is what I'm calling any sudden loud noise that is over and above the normal background din. In my environment that is raised voices, dog barks, footsteps on the wooden floor, metallic noises from the kitchen and the previously described <em>ka-thunk</em> of closing doors. The ANC on the Airpods Max does not do well with any of these. To be fair it is a tough challenge. But what I was not expecting, what blew me away<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was that low frequency event noise (e.g. a <em>ka-thunk</em> of a door) could actually create an uncomfortable ANC burp right into my ear drum. Like a Q-tip that's gone too deep. It's not pleasant and it happens every 10 minutes in my house. Imagine that - a Q-tip to the ear drum every 10 minutes! It doesn't take much of that to make a man want to take his headphones off his irreplaceable ear drums, no matter how expensive they were!</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="they-do-not-sound-good-for-wireless-calls-on-the-mac">They do not sound good for wireless calls on the Mac</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Believe me when I say I wish I this wasn't true. Apple have done a magnificent job of making the bluetooth wireless experience acceptable when you are listening to music. It's damned near perfect on the iPhone, and given the crapshoot that is bluetooth accessories on the Mac - it worked really quite well there too.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Without going in to too many details (I have researched the death out of this trying to get it to work), when the Airpods Max are connected as an output device, macOS will negotiate a 48kHz streaming audio session using AAC. It might not convince some music purists but it sounds just peachy to me. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When, however you tell macOS to use the Airpods Max as an input device things start to go downhill. It will negotiate a two-way SCO connection that reduces the audio quality for both the input and the output device. Yes that's right. If the microphone is active, everything sounds worse too. How much worse? Well I'm glad you asked. My desktop Mac<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> uses a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset. When the Airpods Max connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset you end up with 8kHz audio. You can search the internet for this - it also happens for the regular Airpods and Airpods Pro. If you've been on a Zoom call with someone using Airpods that sounded like they are on the world's worst telephone - this is probably the reason. It can support 48kHz streaming audio simplex but only 8kHz duplex. I'm not a Bluetooth engineer but something doesn't add up here.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Yes, I have a hackintosh. No, that is not the reason. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

</section>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I also have a &nbsp;2015 era MacBook pro that has a Bluetooth 4.2 chipset. This chipset can support a 16kHz duplex connection to the Airpods Max. It's better... and frankly if my desktop Mac had been able to achieve this I might not have noticed the quality problem until after the return window had closed. But we are still getting a sub-par audio experience if the microphones are in use. The standard response from pretty much <em>everyone</em> on the internet is to turn off the device as an input source and use the internal microphone on your machine. They even have complicated instructions on how to fool the Mac into doing this automatically and one of the most popular apps for Airpods management <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> has the ability to force this built-in. </p><p>Hell no.</p><p>I did not spend all this money on headphones with noise-isolating microphones just to <em>turn it off</em>.</p><p>On my iPhone 11 Pro things are better still. It is able to &nbsp;support a 24kHz duplex connection to the Airpods Max, which (if I'm reading the debug messages correctly) might even be using the AAC codec. I'm not sure if this is a Bluetooth 5.0 bandwidth capability or something else. But suffice to say that if you are getting 24kHz duplex then you can probably stop worrying about wireless quality problems. I wish I had a modern Mac with Bluetooth 5 built in to verify that the same is acheiveable on a modern chipset Mac. I'd be willing to believe so and it leaves me confident that Apple are <em>never</em> going to invest the time in making this better for older hardware. Heck, if it's great on the iPhone and not great on the Mac, that's probably ok by them too.</p><h2 id="what-8khz-audio-sounds-like">What 8kHz audio sounds like</h2><p>I recorded some samples to drive this home.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We often get customers&nbsp;ringing for quotes and being surprised (and sometimes shocked) at the prices we charge. We will get comments along the lines of <em>“So-and-so can do that airport trip for £35. <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">You’re charging £50</a>”</em>.</p>



<p>That is perfectly true. There will <em>always</em> be someone who can do the job at a lower price than Hart Taxis can. We do not compete on price.</p>


<div id="attachment_1405"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" loading="lazy" src="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png" alt="Best Taxi service in Fleet, Yateley, Hartley Wintney" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-300x300.png 300w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-150x150.png 150w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2-250x250.png 250w, https://www.harttaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Best-Taxi-2.png 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1405">Hart Taxis won the ‘Best Taxi Service in Fleet’ award for two years running.</p></div>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there is a set minimum cost to doing business in the taxi trade. This cost includes such items as hourly rates for drivers, servicing costs for vehicles, insurance, licence fees etc.</p>
<p>Some of these fees are non-negotiable: You have to have insurance and you have to have a hackney carriage licence.&nbsp;Other costs are more malleable. For example rather than trying to let a driver earn a living wage by working a maximum 12 hour shift you can cut the amount you pay a driver and force him to work 14 to 18 hours per day for 7 days per week to earn enough. There is an obvious impact on driver safety when this happens.</p>
<p>The other way is to cut down on the servicing for your vehicles. At a recent snap examination in the small hours of the morning the police and the VOSN stopped a number of taxis in Fleet and found that several of them were running vehicles with questionable service records. One of our competitor’s vehicles&nbsp;was found to have four bald tyres and was immediately impounded by the police as being unsafe to drive on the road. All Hart Taxis vehicles passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>The next time you book a vehicle which is ‘cheap’ bear in mind that the driver <em>may</em> have been working 14 or 15 hours when he gets to you and <em>may</em> be running a vehicle which is barely road legal. Both of these factors put you, the passenger, at risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I work in the haulage&nbsp;business and understand the issues facing drivers working long hours. I’m happy to pay the rates Hart Taxis charge if it means my taxi will be on time, with a driver who is awake and ready to drive in a road-safe vehicle – A Hart Taxis customer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there are some taxis who will cut costs by not providing a good service. This may be by promising to arrive at a certain time but then regularly turning up late. Sometimes late enough for you to miss your flight or your train at the station. They may arrive looking scruffy, unshaven or badly dressed. They may take you on a longer route than you expected and <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/2018/04/know-the-full-fare-before-you-get-in-the-vehicle/">hike the fares up that way</a>. Or there may be additional hidden fees added to your fare when you arrive. A good example of this is those companies that <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/what-does-it-cost-to-go-to-the-airport/">charge a low fare for an airport pick-up</a> but then hit you with parking fees and waiting time – especially if your plane arrives late.</p>
<p>Let me be clear; I am not saying that <em>all</em> our cheaper competitors are running their drivers ragged with dirty, unsafe vehicles, lying to customers about when they are going to arrive and causing them to miss their planes and trains. But I am saying that every single one of those behaviours has been reported for one or more of the taxi companies working in the Hart district. All of the companies who have had these behaviours reported about them charge less than Hart Taxis for their services.</p>
<p>With Hart Taxis you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart drivers who have been working a maximum of 12 hours in a single shift and a maximum of 6 shifts per week.</li>
<li>Smart, washed and valeted cars</li>
<li>Road legal vehicles with full service history.</li>
<li>Vehicle tracking services so you can see where your driver is from when they accept your job to when they arrive.</li>
<li>Text information detailing the make, colour and registration of the vehicle that will be picking you up.</li>
<li>Meet and greet service at the airport where we monitor your incoming flight and only send the driver at the appropriate time.</li>
<li>Bottled water on arrival at our airport jobs.</li>
<li>Automated booking via our <a href="https://harttaxis.com/meet-oliviar">Oliviar</a> booking system with the industry’s leading <a href="http://cordic.com/">booking and despatch software</a></li>
<li>Full E-receipt provided on completion of job, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>This service is something which Hart Taxis are proud&nbsp;to offer. But in order to offer this we expect our drivers to be paid an appropriate amount of money.</p>
<p>That is why Hart Taxis are considered by our customers to provide excellent value for money despite being more expensive than others. If you are price sensitive then please let us know and we will happily give you the contact details for our competitors. They may well be cheaper – but at what cost?</p>
<p>Please feel free to check out our <a href="https://www.harttaxis.com/testimonials-2/">testimonials page</a> if you want more feedback about our service. We think you’ll feel that the higher price is worth it.</p></div></div>]]>

as the company pushes forward with better batteries and a commitment to greener air travel.</p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes=""

of the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft at YVR airport in Richmond, British Columbia on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2019. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>A Vancouver seaplane company says its retro-fitted all electric airplane is set to take to the skies for more test flights this year, as it pushes forward with its plans to make commercial air travel cheaper and greener.</p>  <p>"There's no wavering in our confidence and determination and interest in getting this done," said Harbour Air&nbsp;CEO Greg McDougall.</p>  <p>Founded by McDougall in 1982, Harbour Air uses small propeller planes to fly commercial flights between the Lower Mainland, Seattle, Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Whistler.</p>  <p>In the last few years it has <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/world-s-first-all-electric-commercial-seaplane-set-for-takeoff-in-richmond-1.5378163" target="_blank">turned its attention to becoming a leader in green urban mobility</a>, which would do away with the need to burn fossil fuels for air travel.</p>  <p>In December 2019, McDougall flew one of Harbour Air's planes, a more than 60-year-old &nbsp;DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver float plane, which had been outfitted with a Seattle-based company's electric propulsion system, for three minutes over Richmond B.C.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div

over the Fraser River for three minutes today in its debut test flight.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:26</span></span></span></p>  <p>Harbour Air joined with Seattle-based company MagniX in early 2019 to design the e-plane's engine, which was powered by NASA-approved lithium-ion batteries that were also used on the International Space Station.</p>  <p>At the time, based on the success of that inaugural flight, McDougall had hoped to be using the plane to fly passengers on its routes, such as between downtown Vancouver and downtown Victoria, by the end of this year.</p>  <p>Now, that timeline has been pushed back at least one year due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"It's progressing, not as quickly as we hoped due to COVID, but we are getting back on track with the testing program," said McDougall.</p>    <p>Harbour Air has to prove to Transport Canada that its e-plane is as safe as its other conventional planes to allow it to fly with passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says Ottawa has approved a new permit to allow the company to continue with test flights this year, which will be used to improve the plane and all its components.</p>  <h2>New batteries</h2>  <p>Despite the setback from the pandemic, the company stands to benefit from advances in battery technology.</p>  <p>It has partnered with a new company for a different battery that is lighter and provides more power than what was used a year ago.</p>  <p>Analysts of the sector say the success of companies like Harbour Air to fly all-electric in a commercially successful way is completely dependent upon the energy system.</p>  <p>"Technologically, the real challenge is to make the batteries lighter," said Werner Antweiler, a professor of economics at UBC's&nbsp;Sauder School of Business who studies the commercialization of novel technologies around mobility.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt=""

seaplane in late December 2019.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Harbour Air)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The problem with lithium batteries is they are heavy, which means the plane Harbour Air is using them on quickly meets its weight capacity even without passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says battery technology is advancing quickly and he expects them to be even lighter and more powerful, as his project gets closer to flying commercially.</p>  <p>Antweiler says Harbour Air is in the "sweet spot" in the industry as its flights are short, meaning battery technology as it stands today makes the project viable.</p>  <p>"That is an ideal application because the batteries won't get you any farther than that range," he said about the length of flights Harbour Air does.</p>  <p>Getting on an all-electric jetliner to fly across Canada, he says,&nbsp;is decades away.</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

For many, it's the go-to place to stay up-to-date on what's new.</p> <p>While GitHub offers us a way to get notified of changes to repos, the notifications options are limited. You can get notified of new releases or pull requests, but you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. With many devs using specific pages for announcing releases or keeping their changelog, being able to get notified of changes to these specific files, allows you to stay up-to-date on what's new and what's coming.</p> <h2>Build your own GitHub file changes notifier</h2> <p>To build your own GitHub file changes notifier, all you need is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure subscription</a>. In the subscription, you will create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">function app</a>, a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/storage/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic app</a>. Here is the high-level of the solution architecture:</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing architecture of the solution"> </picture> <p>The storage account holds the list of files to check for changes. For each file, you will store its URL, title - for use with notifications, and a hash of its contents used to determine if the file has changed since the last time.</p> <p>The function app hosts the scheduled process that at the specified time retrieves the list of files from the storage account (1), iterates through them, for each (2) one checks if it changed and sends a notification if it did (3). If the file has changed, the function app also updates the file hash in the storage account (4).</p> <p>While there are unlimited ways to send a notification, I find using logic apps the easiest. Logic apps are extremely versatile and with just a few clicks you can set them up to receive notifications on Teams, via email, or on your phone, without having to deal with authentication, response handling, etc.</p> <h3>Set up a storage account</h3> <p>Start, by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a storage account</a> in your resource group.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let's walk through the different pieces of the script.</p> <h4>Load dependencies</h4> <p>Start, by loading the necessary dependencies:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>axios</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>axios</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>default</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We'll use <strong>axios</strong> to execute web requests to download files and trigger notifications. <strong>axios</strong> makes it way easier than using the raw HTTP calls from Node.js. We also need the crypto functions so that we can calculate the hash for the downloaded file contents.</p> <h4>Reference input binding</h4> <p>Extend the function's function to include the <strong>Table parameter name</strong> you copied previously. This argument will contain all files that you've added to the storage account.</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>timer</span><span>,</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h4>Store information about changed files</h4> <p>Next, let's define two arrays for storing information about changed files:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// array of files that have changed</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>// array of notifications</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFilesNotifications</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need two arrays because if we've just added a file to the storage account, its hash (<code>null</code>) will not match the hash retrieved from GitHub and would result in you getting a notification that the file has changed, while it's not quite the case. Storing information about the file that changed and files for which we should issue a notification allows avoiding the unnecessary initial notification.</p> <h4>Retrieve file contents</h4> <p>Then, let's retrieve contents of all files we're tracking:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// retrieve file contents</span>
<span>const</span> <span>requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

  <p>I recently built a static website for a friend using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We installed everything he needed to add content to his website on his laptop. And by all I mean just Hugo and Visual Studio Code. Then he reset his laptop and that set me thinking if we can do with even less, preferably installing nothing at all on his computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> came to mind. With GitHub Codespaces (currently in early access) we get a full VSCode powered development environment in the browser. Best of all it runs in an Ubuntu container giving terminal access, includes tools like Hugo out of the box and handles port forwarding for us.</p>
<p>There's something to be aware of with the automatic port forwarding and static assets such as images. So in this post I'll show how you can build and debug a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll first create an empty repository in GitHub. Make sure to add an empty README file, so we can easily open it with codespaces later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-repository.png" alt="Create new repository with README"></p>
<p>Open GitHub Codespaces in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespaces.png" alt="Codespaces link in the GitHub navbar"></p>
<p>Then create a new Codespace by selecting our repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-codespace.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<p>After a minute your VSCode environment should be ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespace-ready.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We'll run the commands of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo quick start</a> with one modification. If you prefer to just look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/shotor/hugo-codespaces-example">repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># create a new site in the root folder, force it because it's not empty
</span><span>hugo</span><span> new site .</span><span> --force

</span><span># add ananke theme
</span><span>git</span><span> submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke

</span><span># set theme
</span><span>echo </span><span>'theme = "ananke"' </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> config.toml

</span><span># create new post
</span><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll add some content to our <code>my-first-post.md</code> file and also an image that we'll place in the <code>/static</code> folder (just drag it into the sidebar of your Codespace).</p>
<pre><code data-lang="md"><span>---
</span><span>title: 'My First Post'
date: 2021-01-24T12:00:00Z
</span><span>---

</span><span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus in fringilla libero.

</span><span>![</span><span>Placeholder image</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/image.png</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll forward the port in the remote explorer tab. We know Hugo will run on 1313, so that's the port we will forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/port-forward.png" alt="Our forwarded port"></p>
<p>Now if we just run Hugo (<code>hugo server -D</code>) our homepage will work fine. But any internal link or image will fail with a 404 error because it refers to localhost and not our GitHub url. And also there's a port included in all the links.</p>
<p>To fix this we run a modified start command where we set the <code>baseUrl</code> to the url provided by GitHub. We can get this url by right clicking on our forwarded port, and copying the url. We also need to disable the port section (in this case :1313). Our command becomes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>hugo</span><span> server</span><span> -D --baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://your-github-url"</span><span> --appendPort</span><span>=</span><span>false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when we click on our first post, we'll see the blog post as well as the image we uploaded.</p>
<p>That's it, we now have a full development workflow completely in our browser. We can access it from anywhere to add content or make changes to the layout.</p>
<p>In this case we used Hugo, a static site generator. But this idea can be adapted to any type of webserver, for instance NodeJS or Django. As long as you bind the server to localhost and then forward the port. Making sure any internal links or images use the forwarded url as its base url.</p>
<h2 id="deployments-using-netlify">Deployments using Netlify</h2>
<p>To finish it off we'll add deployments using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. We'll follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">the Hugo tutorial</a> and create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root directory.</p>

<p>Codespaces makes it really easy to work on projects hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>There are limitations, the Ubuntu container doesn't allow you to run just any command you want, which makes sense.</p>
<p>For instance I tried to run a <a href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> project, but Zola requires <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft</a>. Which is not included and cannot be installed in Codespaces. To get Zola working I had to upload the Zola binary file myself. No big deal, but on a local or a self-hosted remote vscode environment this is a non-issue.</p>
<p>Right now I'm only using it for small projects. I'm very interested to see how it holds up with bigger projects. In terms of size, as well things required from the operating system.</p>

<p>After a decade of fierce rivalry with China's technology giant Huawei, Europe's telecoms equipment champions Nokia and Ericsson could soon face myriad new competitors to contend with.</p>



<p>As Europe cuts back on using Huawei equipment in its 5G networks, mobile operators are looking far and wide for companies to replace it. The Continent's "big four" telcos Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">published</a> a joint "<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20/POLITICO-Memorandum-of-Understanding-OPEN-RAN-big-four-operators-January-2021.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a>" pledging to prioritize the development of "Open RAN" technology, a concept that would benefit smaller equipment and software makers.</p>



<p>Open RAN encompasses the idea of chopping up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and imposing standards on equipment and software firms so their products can work together — a "Lego approach," as one expert called it, to digital infrastructure. It would allow operators to procure specialized kit and services in smaller contracts with different players to piece together a 5G network, breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The operators' public campaign in favor of the standards comes after years of lobbying against 5G security laws that will significantly decrease Huawei's market presence in Europe in coming years. The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.</p>



<p>Once in place, Open RAN could help equipment makers like South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC, cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as smaller, specialized software companies like Altiostar and Mavenir gain a stronger foothold in Europe’s growing 5G market.</p>



<p>The big four operators said they'd also "promote to European policymakers and industry that adopting a competitive Open RAN ecosystem will place Europe and European industry at the front in the race of technological leadership."</p>



<p>But for the two European leading vendors, Ericsson and Nokia, the political push to boost new competitors could put more strain on already-narrow profit margins and troubled financials.</p>



<h3>Geopolitics of standards</h3>



<p>Operators across the world in 2018 started working on new standards in an association called the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/about" target="_blank">O-RAN Alliance</a>. It's a standard-setting body that includes participants from more than 200 companies across the tech sector, including Microsoft, Facebook, chipmakers, software firms and Europe's leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The O-RAN Alliance includes Chinese operators but not its tech giant Huawei — which is telling. </p>



<p>The Chinese giant has always perceived Open RAN as a challenge to its dominance: "O-RAN is currently hijacked for geo-political reasons. It's been weaponized, specifically against Huawei," a company official said in a conversation in June, requesting not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>



<p>The push for Open RAN standards quickly gained pace in the U.S., where lawmakers realized the country's technology industry had missed the boat on developing 5G equipment.</p>



<p>U.S. Congress in November <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201118/policy/house-unanimously-passes-750-million-open-ran-5g-bill" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> approving $750 million in public funding to develop Open RAN technologies.   </p>



<p>The U.S. tech industry has also been leaning on European capitals through a lobby group called the <a href="https://www.openranpolicy.org/about-us/members/" target="_blank">Open RAN Policy Coalition</a>, formed in May last year. It gathers smaller U.S. software firms like Altiostar and Mavenir with household names like Cisco and Juniper and tech giants Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel and others. Non-U.S. names include Samsung, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, as well as Europe's three largest telecoms operators and Nokia.</p>



<p>"One thing we've heard from European governments ... is that a diverse ecosystem is very important and they want to see that European vendors have a share of the market," said Alex Botting, senior director at Venable, a lobby firm that represents the coalition in talks with European authorities. </p>



<p>In London, the initiative got backing from the government when it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1532681">presented</a> its "diversification strategy" in November. It pledged £250 million in funding to boost innovation in Open RAN and try to introduce new, smaller 5G equipment makers. It also pledged to fund a new trial with Japanese telecoms vendor NEC.</p>



<h3>Europe's gain, Europe's loss</h3>



<p>For European lawmakers, the question is which specific European companies would gain from Open RAN — besides the operators that expect it to bring down procurement prices.</p>



<p>The concept comes with risks to its own leaders in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, who increasingly have free range in markets that have blocked or are shunning Chinese vendors. </p>



<p>"If you break that duopoly and you have lots of new suppliers, what does that do to the two European incumbents?" said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer at global telecoms operators association GSMA.</p>



<p>Nokia has arguably been more receptive to the idea of Open RAN, but Ericsson has been lukewarm. </p>



<p>Its Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">in an interview in July</a> that the technology was still&nbsp;“maturing.” He said the telecoms network market was already open for competitors to try and enter, but few had succeeded because it's a tough market. “We have a consolidated market, we have relatively few radio access network vendors … But it’s still an extremely competitive market,” Ekudden said.  </p>



<p>Lawmakers in Europe have still sought to diversify telecoms vendors as part of the EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123" target="_blank">5G security toolbox</a>" process that aimed to decrease the dependency on Huawei. </p>



<p>Regulators, lawmakers and industry officials are exploring policy options to soften the blow of phasing out Huawei, in working groups within the EU's digital services department as well as in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nis-cooperation-group" target="_blank">NIS Cooperation Group</a>, a roundtable of cybersecurity experts of EU countries and the Commission.</p>



<p>In Berlin, the government also expressed support for Open RAN in recent updates of telecoms security rules, and operators have launched <a href="https://uk.nec.com/en_GB/press/202012/global_20201216_01.html" target="_blank">pilot projects</a> with new vendors already. </p>



<h3>Technical challenges ahead</h3>



<p>Above all, the operators' document Wednesday is a signal to both the industry's supply chain and the regulators overseeing it that they take Open RAN seriously.</p>



<p>In the document, they pledged to work together on Open RAN standards, invest in developing the technology and push governments and regulators to contribute research funding and “policy support.”</p>



<p>The four telcos, together with U.S. and Chinese counterparts like AT&amp;T, Verizon, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom and others, buy the most network equipment. A choice for a certain technology is certain to spur research by suppliers in coming years, and that could speed up the process to get large Open RAN networks up and running. </p>



<p>"Left to its natural course, this would probably take many years to become significant," said GSMA's Sinclair, adding that operators' public support "is all about accelerating this."</p>



<p>But running a network of smaller building blocks also increases technical headaches, he said: "If you're dealing with smaller suppliers, you have quite a lot of procurement problems," adding Open RAN networks would need a "system integrator" company to manage all the different parts — a role that operators in past decades have sourced out to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>2020 was an intense year. I hope you're healthy and keep being healthy. I am privileged (as lots of software engineers and academics are) to be able to work from home during the pandemic. Let's not forget people in less privileged situations,  and let’s try to give them as much practical, psychological and financial support as we can these days. And as much joy as possible to everyone around :)</p>
<p>I cancelled the autumn MirageOS retreat due to the pandemic. Instead I collected donations for our hosts in Marrakech - they were very happy to receive our financial support, since they had a difficult year, since their income is based on tourism. I hope that in autumn 2021 we'll have an on-site retreat again.</p>
<p>For 2021, we (at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a>) got a grant from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS" (more details below), and another grant from <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml software foundation</a> for securing the opam supply chain (using <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a>). Some long-awaited releases for MirageOS libraries, namely a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">ssh implementation</a> and a rewrite of our <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git implementation</a> have already been published.</p>
<p>With my MirageOS view, 2020 was a pretty successful year, where we managed to add more features, fixed lots of bugs, and paved the road ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> for funding work on MirageOS maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-2020">Recap 2020</h2>

<p>Here is a very subjective random collection of accomplishments in 2020, where I was involved with some degree.</p>
<h3 id="NetHSM">NetHSM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm">NetHSM</a> is a hardware security module in software. It is a product that uses MirageOS for security, and is based on the <a href="https://muen.sk/">muen</a> separation kernel. We at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a> were heavily involved in this product. It already has been security audited by an external team. You can pre-order it from Nitrokey.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-1-3">TLS 1.3</h3>

<p>Dating back to 2016, at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2016/tron-workshop-programme/">TRON</a> (TLS 1.3 Ready or NOt), we developed a first draft of a 1.3 implementation of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>. Finally in May 2020 we got our act together, including ECC (ECDH P256 from <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/">fiat</a>, X25519 from <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">hacl</a>) and testing with <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer">tlsfuzzer</a>, and release tls 0.12.0 with TLS 1.3 support. Later we added <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ECC ciphersuites to TLS version 1.2</a>, implemented <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ChaCha20/Poly1305</a>, and fixed an <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/424">interoperability issue with Go's implementation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto">Mirage-crypto</a> provides the underlying cryptographic primitives, initially released in March 2020 as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto">nocrypto</a> -- huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">pqwy</a> for his great work. Mirage-crypto detects <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/53">CPU features at runtime</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Julow">Julow</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/96">bugfix for bswap</a>), using constant time modular exponentation (powm_sec) and hardens against Lenstra's CRT attack, supports <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/39">compilation on Windows</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/avsm">avsm</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/90">async entropy harvesting</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/seliopou">seliopou</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/65">32 bit support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/72">chacha20/poly1305</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/84">cross-compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EduardoRFS">EduardoRFS</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/78">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/81">bug</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/83">fixes</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/95">memory leak</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/talex5">talex5</a> for reporting several of these issues), and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/99">RSA</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/100">interoperability</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/psafont">psafont</a> for investigation and <a href="https://github.com/mattjbray">mattjbray</a> for reporting). This library feels very mature now - being used by multiple stakeholders, and lots of issues have been fixed in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="Qubes-Firewall">Qubes Firewall</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/">MirageOS based Qubes firewall</a> is the most widely used MirageOS unikernel. And it got major updates: in May <a href="https://github.com/linse">Steffi</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/Xzplmkjwa5Y">announced</a> her and <a href="https://github.com/yomimono">Mindy's</a> work on improving it for Qubes 4.0 - including <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-interface/#firewall-rules-in-4x">dynamic firewall rules via QubesDB</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/portable-firewall-fuer-qubesos/">prototypefund</a> for sponsoring.</p>
<p>In October 2020, we released <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-39-release">Mirage 3.9</a> with PVH virtualization mode (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mato">mato</a>). There's still a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/issues/120">memory leak</a> to be investigated and fixed.</p>
<h3 id="IPv6">IPv6</h3>

<p>In December, with <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-310-release">Mirage 3.10</a> we got the IPv6 code up and running. Now MirageOS unikernels have a dual stack available, besides IPv4-only and IPv6-only network stacks. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nojb">nojb</a> for the initial code and <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS">MagnusS</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out this blog, but also robur services, are now available via IPv6 :)</p>
<h3 id="Albatross">Albatross</h3>

<p>Also in December, I pushed an initial release of <a href="https://github.com/roburio/albatross">albatross</a>, a unikernel orchestration system with remote access. <em>Deploy your unikernel via a TLS handshake -- the unikernel image is embedded in the TLS client certificates.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reynir">reynir</a> for statistics support on Linux and improvements of the systemd service scripts. Also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfcs">cfcs</a> for the initial Linux port.</p>
<h3 id="CA-certs">CA certs</h3>

<p>For several years I postponed the problem of how to actually use the operating system trust anchors for OCaml-TLS connections. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/emillon">emillon</a> for initial code, there are now <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs">ca-certs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs-nss">ca-certs-nss</a> opam packages (see <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ca-certs-and-ca-certs-nss">release announcement</a>) which fills this gap.</p>
<h2 id="Unikernels">Unikernels</h2>

<p>I developed several useful unikernels in 2020, and also pushed <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/gallery">a unikernel gallery</a> to the Mirage website:</p>
<h3 id="Traceroute-in-MirageOS">Traceroute in MirageOS</h3>

<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/Posts/Traceroute">traceroute</a> which traces the routing to a given remote host.</p>
<h3 id="Unipi-static-website-hosting">Unipi - static website hosting</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/roburio/unipi">Unipi</a> is a static site webserver which retrieves the content from a remote git repository. Let's encrypt certificate provisioning and dynamic updates via a webhook to be executed for every push.</p>
<h4 id="TLSTunnel-TLS-demultiplexing">TLSTunnel - TLS demultiplexing</h4>

<p>The physical machine this blog and other robur infrastructure runs on has been relocated from Sweden to Germany mid-December. Thanks to UPS! Fewer IPv4 addresses are available in the new data center, which motivated me to develop <a href="https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>.</p>
<p>The new behaviour is as follows (see the <code>monitoring</code> branch):</p>
<ul><li>listener on TCP port 80 which replies with a permanent redirect to <code>https</code></li><li>listener on TCP port 443 which forwards to a backend host if the requested server name is configured</li><li>its configuration is stored on a block device, and can be dynamically changed (with a custom protocol authenticated with a HMAC)</li><li>it is setup to hold a wildcard TLS certificate and in DNS a wildcard entry is pointing to it</li><li>setting up a new service is very straightforward: only the new name needs to be registered with tlstunnel together with the TCP backend, and everything will just work</li></ul>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>The year started with a release of <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">awa</a>, a SSH implementation in OCaml (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haesbaert">haesbaert</a> for initial code). This was followed by a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git 3.0 release</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure">dinosaure</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-MirageOS-NGI-Pointer">Deploying MirageOS - NGI Pointer</h3>

<p>For 2021 we at robur received funding from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS", which boils down into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>reproducible binary releases of MirageOS unikernels,</li><li>monitoring (and other devops features: profiling) and integration into existing infrastructure,</li><li>and further documentation and advertisement.</li></ul>

<p>Of course this will all be available open source. Please get in touch via eMail (team aT robur dot coop) if you're eager to integrate MirageOS unikernels into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>We discovered at an initial meeting with an infrastructure provider that a DNS resolver is of interest - even more now that dnsmasq suffered from <a href="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq_Technical-Whitepaper.pdf">dnspooq</a>. We are already working on an <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/pull/251">implementation of DNSSec</a>.</p>
<p>MirageOS unikernels are binary reproducible, and <a href="https://github.com/rjbou/orb/pull/1">infrastructure tools are available</a>. We are working hard on a web interface (and REST API - think of it as "Docker Hub for MirageOS unikernels"), and more tooling to verify reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="Conex-securing-the-supply-chain">Conex - securing the supply chain</h3>

<p>Another funding from the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/">OCSF</a> is to continue development and deploy <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a> - to bring trust into opam-repository. This is a great combination with the reproducible build efforts, and will bring much more trust into retrieving OCaml packages and using MirageOS unikernels.</p>
<h3 id="MirageOS-4-0">MirageOS 4.0</h3>

<p>Mirage so far still uses ocamlbuild and ocamlfind for compiling the virtual machine binary. But the switch to dune is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1195">close</a>, a lot of effort has been done. This will make the developer experience of MirageOS much more smooth, with a per-unikernel monorepo workflow where you can push your changes to the individual libraries.</p>


<p>If you want to support our work on MirageOS unikernels, please <a href="https://robur.coop/Donate">donate to robur</a>. I'm interested in feedback, either via <a href="https://twitter.com/h4nnes">twitter</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hannesm">hannesm@mastodon.social</a> or an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/hannes.nqsb.io/issues">data repository</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1
❯ ls -alh
Permissions Size User     Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--   167 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  control.ts
.rw-r--r--   183 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  info.json
drwxr-xr-x     - cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  node_modules

.rw-r--r--   331 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  tsconfig.json
.rw-r--r--   35k cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  yarn.lock</code></pre>
 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",
  "install_mod": "run-s clean:install copy:install",

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?
