<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share 13 lessons I learned from my failures and my successes.</p>
<p>I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<p>While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

Score 74 | Comments 12 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24016718">thread link</a>) | @todsacerdoti

July 31, 2020 | https://blog.winter.dev/2020/designing-a-physics-engine/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.winter.dev/2020/designing-a-physics-engine/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>

<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>

<span>};</span>

<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>collider</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>colliderTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphere</span><span>,</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>sphereTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
 
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>planeTransform</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>SphereCollider</span>
	<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>
<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Center</span><span>;</span>

<span>};</span></pre>



<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>

<p>It is one of the most commonly used supplements frequently taken to address joint pain, but there might be more to this dietary supplement than first meets the eye.</p>
<p>Glucosamine was originally discovered during the 1960s in Italy by pharmacologist Professor Luigi Rovati. Glucosamine is one of the most commonly used dietary supplements and is typically taken to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p>Glucosamine is a polysaccharide that is found naturally in cartilaginous joint tissues, bones, skin, ligaments, and nails, and it is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. In the context of joints, synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces.</p>
<p>Despite it being frequently taken for arthritis, the evidence for its effectiveness is limited, although, there is data for it being anti-inflammatory, as suggested by the results of a randomized clinical trial in 2015 [1].</p>
<p>However, glucosamine supplementation seems to correlate with lower all-cause mortality and other mortality risks, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive diseases. A recent <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> published in the journal BMJ showed that glucosamine supplementation conveys around a 15% reduction of all-cause mortality [2]. This is a considerable amount when compared to other lifestyle interventions as well as other supplements. The data gathered is from a large number of people, and the trend of reduced mortality is unmistakable.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This population-based prospective cohort study included 495 077 women and men (mean (SD) age, 56.6 (8.1) years) from the UK Biobank study. Participants were recruited from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up through 2018. We evaluated all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive disease. HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.</p>
<p>Regular glucosamine supplementation was associated with lower mortality due to all causes, cancer, CVD, respiratory and digestive diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The exact reasons for this correlation with the reduction of various mortality risks is as yet unknown, but given the large patient group in this and in other analyses along with the popularity of this supplement, it is impossible to deny that there is a definite trend here.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that you take this supplement, but given that it is cheap and freely available with an excellent safety profile, it may be worth your consideration and further research to evaluate if you wish to take it or not.</p>

Storage costs money. But <em>how much</em> are we talking? Further, every company understands the logic of running "loss leaders" in order to seed stickiness and future growth. <strong>While literally every other company on Earth is throwing all sorts of free benefits to attract developers</strong>, Slack found developer communities growing like a weed on it, and flicked them away like so much dandruff. Stewart Butterfield is like the anti-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM-2OVNt-eQ">Ballmer</a>.</p> <p>I'm not here to argue that Slack lost developers because it didn't want developers. That's a tautology. I'm here to argue that <strong>this is a strategic fumble</strong> that opened up the field to whatever will eventually replace Slack for startups (Microsoft Teams' success is difficult to assess so I will ignore it here).</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="slack-losing-its-way">Slack Losing Its Way</h2> <p><strong>Developers are your canary in the coalmine</strong> for user experience - because they create the damn things!</p> <p>Slack's original appeal was that it had a much better user experience than prior work chat/email/collaboration tools including the now-dead HipChat and Campfire. Reams of VC pitch decks were made about the "Consumerization of the Workplace" thanks to Slack's approachable design (as <a href="https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908">MetaLab never fails to remind you</a>) and early touches like emoji reactions and bots. The theory was that we demand the UX polish that we see in our personal lives, in our professional lives as well.</p> <p>Fast forward to today: "I’ve been using Discord a ton lately. Slack for work and Discord for hobbies." That's from <a href="https://twitter.com/1Marc/status/1261960701666623488">Marc Grabanski</a>, who knows a thing or two about developer trends.</p> <p>I'll raise you another point: In 2016, Slack was originally backronym'ed into the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9">Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to today and advice from the curiously high amount of "how to work from home" content you've undoubtedly been receiving is overwhelmingly <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/#2-communicate-asynchronously">Communicate Asynchronously</a> and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1331-process-and-tools-how-to-collaborate-effectively-when-your-team-is-remote#but-are-there-tools-you-just-cant-live-without">Use Anything But Slack for Long Lived Knowledge</a>.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="the-game-is-changing">The Game is Changing</h2> <p>Meanwhile the UX bar has risen in the past 5 years:</p> <ul> <li>Slack makes you create a email and password anew every time you join a new Slack. Clicking a Discord invite immediately lands you in the channel as long as you're logged in.</li> <li>Slack walks you through the full onboarding experience every time you join a new Slack. I've joined probably 80 Slacks, I'm tired of the "👋 Hi, Slackbot here!" welcome messages on how to use Slack, or the downright <em>buggy</em> step through guide that prompts me to put in my profile picture even though Slack clearly figured out that I use the same damn picture every time and is already displaying it. Discord does exactly none of this.</li> <li>You need to repeat the whole email and signup song and dance when you move to your phone. Discord is cross-platform-first - sign in on desktop and you're also signed in on mobile.</li> <li>(Developer specific) The new WYSIWYG editor rolled out last year <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people">made it annoying</a> for developers accustomed to What We Type Is What We Get Thank You Very Much. Not only does Discord not get in the way of your typing, it offers <strong>SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING</strong> if you add <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting">language identifiers</a> to your code fenced blocks!</li> </ul> <p>The past year or so in Office Productivity has been a free-for-all as other companies moved into Slack's open flanks. Notion has torn it up as the Searchable Knowledge Base to beat today. Zoom has overwhelmingly captured video chat, despite Slack also offering it natively. Even a bootstrapped startup like <a href="http://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> has become successful despite Slack buying the literal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/slack-buys-screenhero-to-add-screen-sharing-and-voice-chat-to-its-work-messaging-platform/">category maker</a> in the space. And of course Discord and even Telegram have made inroads in real time chat.</p> <p>My intuition is that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/">the Great Unbundling</a> has come for Slack. Whether or not it survives will probably depend on this: Is text chat really <a href="https://jtbd.info/feature-vs-product-42bf2dad2764">a feature or a product</a>? Either way, having to answer that question is an undesirable strategic position for Slack to be in. There is no victory in this fight.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: if you feel lost right about here, I released the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/dev-guide-to-tech-strategy/">Developer's Guide to Tech Strategy</a> chapter of <a href="https://twitter.com/coding_career">my upcoming book</a> recently, feel free to pause and check it out.</p> </blockquote> </section> <section> <h2 id="not-over-yet">Not Over Yet</h2> <p>Slack has fumbled a ball, but it still has a strong lead.

Both were introduced in 2017, probably the peak year of innovation for Slack before creating <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slack+fund&amp;oq=slack+fund&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59l2j69i65l2j69i61j69i60.843j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">the Slack fund</a> in 2018 and then its 2019 IPO.</p> <p>From my limited anecdata, the no-code <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/slack-launches-workflow-builder-for-businesses-to-make-apps-without-code/">Workflow Builder</a> hasn't yet had significant adoption, but I would be happy to see this change over time. All great platforms eventually add low/no-code automation.</p> <p>Slack has also made heavy investments for Enterprise Adoption, with things like <a href="https://slackhq.com/introducing-slack-enterprise-grid">Enterprise Grid</a> (also in 2017! hmm...). I of course don't have any insight into Slack's growth in the Enterprise. I'm fully aware of the economic incentives of going upmarket and forsaking low end customers.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="communities-over-teams">Communities Over Teams</h2> <p>The net result of all this is that Slack is now very much not <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-design/a/stewart-butterfield/">the operating system for your team</a> that it set out to be. However its entire user experience is tied to teams.</p> <p>More specifically - having one single home team, interacting with that team on one device, and the assumption that you don't join or change teams very often. Perhaps this is the disconnect we are sensing.</p> <p> Slack's focus on teams may be becoming outdated in this new world we live in, where Deep Work and organized knowledge bases come at a premium, and our professional work crosses professional and personal boundaries, and spans across multiple devices, modalities and even multiple communities we both lead and participate in. Discord's focus on communities may win hearts and eventually wallets. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtkemple/status/1260947289436303367?s=20">Kurt Kemple on Discord's community features</a>, for thought: </p> <blockquote> <p>Discord is more community friendly IMO. Things like moderation, roles, boosting, group A/V, all make it a great place for a more democratized and scaleable platform.</p> </blockquote> <p>By focusing on communities instead of siloed teams, Discord becomes a friend of community leaders. In other words, <strong>Discord aggregates aggregators</strong>. In a world of <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>, this is a very good thing.</p> <p>I thought it was Paul Graham or Benedict Evans who said this, but am unable to find the source: "What hackers do for fun today, we will do at work tomorrow".</p> <p><strong>Hackers are deserting Slack in droves</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In her 2001 book <em>Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke</em>, Professor Napier showed that many fans of
anime work in computer science and its related fields. The survey also happened to show that “over
70 percent had a grade point average of 3.0 or higher, which is especially impressive when one
considers the academic rigor of scientific fields.”</p>
<p>Anime has a pretty well-known reputation for creating <a href="https://youtu.be/755BDwzxv5c?t=3">men of culture</a>. That’s a clear
indication that anime fans can be profoundly affected by the medium. In addition, many prolific
open source contributors have anime characters as their profile picture. So that got me to thinking,
does being a fan of anime also make you a more intelligent person?</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laynH/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books/master/C%2B%2B/Sakura_Nene_CPP.jpg" alt="sakura nene cpp"></p>
<p>Of course, a question like that is nearly impossible to answer directly. After all, there’s
countless ways to measure intelligence, and anime fandom is so broad that no one definition can fit
all cases. For example, should we consider someone who has only watched <em>Spirited Away</em>, and liked
it very much, but has no exposure to other forms of anime, to be an anime fan? What about people who
only read manga? Or those who exclusively watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader_(web_series)">whatever this is supposed to be</a>?</p>
<p>A smaller question that’s easily answerable would be to see if having an anime profile picture
correlates with you being a better programmer. After all, if someone takes the effort to set their
profile picture to a waifu, they clearly have some fondness for anime. As for being a “better
programmer,” we’ll just equate being better with having more activity on GitHub. And being good at
programming does require an amount of critical reasoning at logic skill, which should equate to a
higher intelligence. Of course, this metric could be easily abused by having a <code>cron</code> job making a
ton of commits, but it’s a measure of programming activity that should be Good Enough™.</p>
<p>Luckily, Google provides their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">image labelling API</a> for very cheap (or free, if you
have GCP credit). As an example, putting in an image of best girl Mai Sakurajima from <em>Rascal Does
Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai</em> into the demo provided, I’ll get this list of labels back from it:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/mai_google_vision.png" alt="mai"></p>
<p>Notice how one of the labels is “Anime”? That’s a surprise tool that will help us later :) Google
also provides a Python API, which makes it even easier to check images, since all you have to do now
is check if “Anime” is one of the tags:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>anime_or_not</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>label_detection</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>=</span><span>image</span><span>)</span>
    <span>labels</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>label_annotations</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>labels</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>description</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Anime"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As for GitHub commits, we can use the <a href="https://docs.github.com/v3/activity/event_types/">events API</a> that’s roughly analogous to the
contribution history graph of a user. We’ll be measuring user activity just by the number of events
for each user, so each event (opening a PR, creating a repo, etc.) is given equal weight. That’s
roughly analogous to how green a user’s contribution heatmap is.</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_contribution_graph.png" alt="contribution map"></p>
<p><a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGitHub</a> wraps the GitHub API into an easy to use library, so getting the number of
events for a user, as well as their profile picture’s URL, is pretty simple:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_users</span><span>()</span>

<span>for</span> <span>user</span> <span>in</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span>
    <span>event_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>event</span> <span>in</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>get_events</span><span>():</span>
        <span>event_count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>is_anime_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>check_if_weeb</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>avatar_url</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>GitHub does rate limit the API to 5000 requests per hour for authenticated users. That’s enough to
run about 2000 requests per hour. To get around that, we can take advantage of how GitHub profile
IDs are numbered sequentially and process profiles in batches of 1000:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>github_id</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1200000</span><span>,</span> <span>1201000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_user</span><span>(</span><span>github_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>

    <span># do user stuff here
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve modified the <code>get_user</code> function here to use the undocumented <code>/user/:id</code> endpoint. This hasn’t
been implemented in PyGitHub yet, but <a href="https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1615">this issue</a> seems to be tracking it.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to link these APIs up and save the data. It’s trivial to just loop through all
users using the <code>/users</code> GitHub API endpoint, send their image over to the Google Vision API, note
down whether they had an anime profile picture and the number of events for that user, and finally
log it into a CSV for analysis later. That’s exactly what I did, and you can see my code
<a href="https://github.com/h313/anime-face">here</a>. It’s very research quality, so don’t expect much.</p>
<p>So now I’ve got a table of 3497 GitHub profiles, of which only 23 have anime profile pictures.
Here’s a box plot that displays the distribution of user activity by profile picture type:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_boxplot.png" alt="box plot"></p>
<p>Hmm, the users with an anime profile picture do seem to have a higher average number of
activities. But we can’t stop here. Keep in mind that there’s way more samples of users without
anime profile pictures compared to those with, as well as the comparatively high amount of
outliers in both groups. To be sure that the difference here is statistically significant,
we’ll need to do a T-test:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>scipy.stats</span> <span>import</span> <span>ttest_ind</span>

<span>cat1</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span>cat2</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>False</span><span>]</span>

<span>ttest_ind</span><span>(</span><span>cat1</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>],</span> <span>cat2</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That provides a p-value of <code>0.2371</code>. We now have to conclude that the higher average we got isn’t
statistically significant, since our p-value of 23.7% doesn’t meet the traditional 5% cutoff.
Therefore, we must once again acquiesce to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s law</a>, and adopt our null
hypothesis, that having an anime profile picture does not necessarily correlate with your abilities
as a programmer.</p>
<p>Further work into this topic can be done, however. Since this project only looked at a small
number of users, who were among the first to register, it is not a representative slice of the
GitHub user population. In addition, it may also be enlightening to include the inactive users
skipped in this experiment.</p>

<p>Wirth’s law is not really a law. Actually, none of them ever are laws. They are adages:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>a proverb or short statement expressing a general truth.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage">https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Here is another law that is not a real law:&nbsp;<em>Moore’s law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.</em></p>



<p>This means that we can expect the speed and capability of computers to increase while lowering the costs. Sadly, this is where Wirth’s law comes in:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Wirth’s law is an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.</em></p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>And while Moore’s law has proven to be true since 1975, Wirth’s law seems to be true as well. Niklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal, wrote an article in 1995:</p>



<blockquote><p>About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as little as 8,000 bytes of storage. (Modern program editors request 100 times that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern software would be utterly unusable.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>The problem of modern software development is manyfold. Wirth points out one crucial aspect: time.</p>



<blockquote><p>Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while that was true back in 1995, that is no longer the most important factor. We now have to deal with a much bigger problem: abstraction. Developers never built things from scratch, and that has never been a problem, but now they have also become lazy.</p>



<p>It was Edsger W. Dijkstra who tried to improve the quality of code and coined the concept of <em>structured programming</em>. He tried to get programming out of the state of crisis it was in, and he found support in programmers like Harlan D. Mills, Richard C. Linger and Bernard I. Witt. For a short period of time, programming was seen as a real craftmanship. Programmers cared about the quality of their programs, and that included clarity and efficiency.</p>



<p>Those times have passed. With the introduction of higher-level languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP and Javascript all in 1995, the same year in which Wirth wrote his article, programming became more abstract. </p>



<p>Languages like these made programming a lot easier and took many things out of the programmer’s hands. They were object-oriented and came with things as an IDE and garbage collection.</p>



<p>This meant that programmers had fewer things to worry about, which is of course great. Sadly, everything comes with a price. Having fewer things to worry about, also means having fewer things to think about. 1995 was the year in which programmers stopped thinking about the quality of their programs.</p>



<p>It also marked the beginning of the widespread use of libraries, probably one of the bigger problems. Don’t get me wrong, I love libraries. They are the only reason I am able to get things done. However, a library never comes with the exact things that you need.</p>



<p>Because a library is not made for one specific project, it probably has a bit more functionalities than you really needed. No problem, you would say. However, things pile up pretty quickly. Even the people who like libraries, don’t want to reinvent the wheel. This results in what we call dependency hell. <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html">Nikola Duza wrote a post about that issue in Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>The problem does not seem that big, but try to grasp what is happening here. In another tutorial that Nikola wrote, he built a simple todo-list. It works in your browser with HTML and Javascript. How many dependencies did he use? <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/05/14/javascript-growing-pains-from-0-to-13000-dependencies.html">13,000.</a></p>



<p>These numbers are insane, but this problem will only keep increasing. As new, very useful libraries keep being built, the number of dependencies per project will keep growing as well.</p>



<p>That means that the problem Niklaus was warning us about in 1995, only gets bigger over time. </p>



<p>And no, you don’t have to learn assembly and start writing your web application in that. A good way to start would be to split up libraries. Instead of creating one big library that does everything you could ever possibly need, just create many libraries. Your god-like library could still exist, but solely as a wrapper. </p>



<p>This way a programmer only has to select the libraries he really requires, while ignoring the functionalities he is not going to use in his application. Not only are his dependencies smaller, but they will also use less of their dependencies because the dependencies of the unused functionalities do not have to be installed.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Note: </strong>The proposed solution obviously is not <em>the</em> solution. It would for example require a good way of versioning software to avoid a new dependency hell.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice.

This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product. But for startups, this merely <em>raises the table stakes</em> instead of offering a competitive advantage, and it <strong>neutralizes the technology edge</strong> any single company can have over another. Great for OpenAI, not great for new startups.</p><p><strong>Then imagine how much worse this will get when GPT-4 comes out.

    <p>Press Release<br>July 30, 2020</p>

<h3><strong>Google removes all Danish music from YouTube </strong></h3>
<h5>While the negotiations on a new joint Nordic agreement are in full swing, Google have chosen to leverage their total dominance in the market in the strongest way possible. On the evening of Thursday 30 July, Google announced that they will soon remove all Danish music content on YouTube.</h5>

<p>Under the auspices of the Nordic alliance of collecting societies, Polaris, negotiations on a joint Nordic agreement on the use of music on YouTube are currently in full swing. The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Although the parties involved in the negotiations on the new joint agreement are by no means in concord yet, progress has been made in recent weeks, and Koda is puzzled by the extremely aggressive approach taken by Google in the negotiations this time.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s media director, Kaare Struve, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘Google have always taken an “our way or the highway” approach, but even for Google, this is a low point. Of course, Google know that they can create enormous frustration among our members by denying them access to YouTube – and among the many Danes who use YouTube every day. We can only suppose that by doing so, YouTube hope to be able to push through an agreement, one where they alone dictate all terms’.</p>
<p>Ever since the first agreement was signed in 2013, the level of payments received from YouTube has been significantly lower than the level of payment agreed to by subscription-based services.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s CEO, Gorm Arildsen, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘It is no secret that our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of payment received for the use of their music on YouTube for many years now. And it’s no secret that we at Koda have actively advocated putting an end to the tech giants’ free-ride approach and underpayment for artistic content in connection with the EU’s new Copyright Directive. The fact that Google now demands that the payments due from them should be reduced by almost 70% in connection with a temporary contract extension seems quite bizarre’.</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/">archive.org</a>

        <h2 id="backstory-and-first-attempts">Backstory and first attempts</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post I’ve been working on reverse engineering the PLA chip in the C128.
I’m now mostly done with this process so I think it’s time to share some of the findings.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor design
and manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the pretty
looking pictures.</p>
<p>It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Cheap microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" alt="Cheap microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies out
of the packaging.</p>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQeHHYJYWXo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid or
other similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around
(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.
The first real photo was the one show in the last post.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/now-available/pla-die.png" alt="Full 8721 PLA die photo">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="better-microscope">Better microscope</h2>
<p>While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of high
enough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the die
on a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.</p>
<p>As such a better microscope was sourced and purchased, still within reasonable money.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" alt="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It’s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundation
released the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly bought
one and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" alt="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">
</a>
</p>
<p>All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to make
larger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I’m still struggling
with the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comes
to panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.</p>
<h2 id="motorizing">Motorizing</h2>
<p>This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photos
ended up being moved in multiple axis etc.</p>
<p>Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" alt="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7” display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted on
the microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.</p>
<p>The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.</p>
<p>This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.</p>

<p>With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chip
as this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_array">Programmable Logic Array</a> and is a very common structure in designs from this era.</p>
<p>Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND and
outputs from the OR array.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once we
have established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just as
expected. This also helps us establish which array is which.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" alt="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
</a>
</p>
<p>Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two main
areas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a question
mark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage of
some kind.</p>
<h2 id="and-array">AND array</h2>
<p>So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still done
using the AmScope camera and I didn’t figure out how to set the white balance on it.</p>

</p>
<p>This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This was
early on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing to
remove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the details that I needed were in the diffusion embedded into the substrate:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix substrate">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" alt="AND matrix substrate">
</a>
</p>
<p>Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="or-array">OR array</h2>
<p>Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the AND
matrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.</p>


<h2 id="full-matrix-decode">Full matrix decode</h2>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.</p>
<p>I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.
All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.</p>
<p>By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example</p>
<pre><code>    p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15
</code></pre><p>For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example</p>
<pre><code>    SDEN = p42 | p43 | p66 | p69
</code></pre><p>So now we have the entire set of logic equations. Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="output-stage">Output stage</h2>
<p>Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.</p>
<p>Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structure
is bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code>.</p>
<p><code>DWE</code> is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals are
processed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.</p>


<p>After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematic
for this that makes sense. I’m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also like
to thank <a href="https://www.patreon.com/androSID">Frank Wolf</a> for his help, please support his project if you can!</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Output block schematic">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" alt="Output block schematic">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going a bit further, the way this is used in the <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code> outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comes
for the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I’m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the first
verilog I’ve ever written so it’s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, however
in this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.</p>
<p>I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I’ve missed anything please let me know!</p>
<p>In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the output latches.</p>

<p>A study published in medical journal <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> has found learning music does not have a positive impact on children's cognitive skills, such as memory and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Giovanni Sala at Fujita Health University, Japan, and Fernand Gobet at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK, examined evidence on the effects of music training on children's cognitive skills and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Previous research indicated a link between music training and better skills and performance, with some researchers even suggesting that playing an instrument can raise your IQ.</p> 
 
<p>But after analysing data from 54 studies conducted on 6,984 participants between 1986 and 2019, Dr Sala’s team found music training was ineffective at enhancing cognitive or academic skills, regardless of the skill type, participants' age and duration of music training.</p> 

<p>The authors found studies with high-quality design, such as those which used a group of active controls – children who did not learn music but instead learned a different skill, such as dance or sports, for example – showed no effect of music education on cognitive or academic performance.</p> 
<p>"Our study shows that the common idea that 'music makes children smarter' is incorrect,” said Dr Sala, the lead author.</p> 
<p>"On the practical side, this means that teaching music with the sole intent of enhancing a child's cognitive or academic skills may be pointless.</p> 
<p>“While the brain can be trained in such a way that if you play music, you get better at music, these benefits do not generalise in such a way that if you learn music, you also get better at maths.</p> 
<p>"Researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training appears to be unjustified and may stem from misinterpretation of previous empirical data."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<![CDATA[What Is the PCI of Bank Payments?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Credit card users today can transact online with peace of mind because card-accepting merchants are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS was established in 2006 by a consortium of credit card companies to combat online fraud. <a href="#1">[1]</a> It sets exacting requirements on how merchants store, process, and transmit credit card data. <a href="#2">[2]</a> Merchants that don’t comply risk getting fined or even outright banned from the card networks.</p><p>Security is also a concern for bank payments. If anything, bank account numbers are even more sensitive than credit card numbers because they don’t change. In this post, we’ll examine the impact of ACH payment fraud, describe upcoming compliance requirements, and share what we consider to be security best practices.</p></div><h5>Sizing Bank Payments Fraud</h5><p>Before diving into a solution, it's worth assessing the fraud problem. After all, bank transfers have historically been perceived as the most secure payment method. A Federal Reserve study found that ACH payments in 2015 had the lowest fraud rate of all US payment methods at 0.0008%. <a href="#4">[4]</a> That works out to just 8 fraudulent cents for every $10,000 moved.<br></p><p>However, a deeper look reveals how that perception is challenged as bank payments volume moves online. The most recent figures show ACH volume on the internet grew to $2.9 trillion in 2018 up 14.2% from the prior year. <a href="#5">[5]</a> That same year, ACH was the only payment method to see an increase in fraud rates, according to research from the Association of Financial Professionals. <a href="#6">[6]</a> The percentage of surveyed organizations that encountered ACH credit fraud spiked to 20%, up from 7% a year prior. 33% of the surveyed organizations had encountered ACH debit fraud, up from 28% a year prior.</p><p>So ACH fraud has risen sharply in recent years. What security rules are in place to combat this?</p><h5>The NACHA Response</h5><p>The closest analogue to PCI DSS is the ACH Security Framework Rule introduced in 2013 by NACHA, the ACH network’s governing body. In a nutshell, the rule requires ACH network participants to “protect the confidentiality and integrity of [non-public personal information] until its destruction.” <a href="#7">[7]</a> Compliance is verified through an annual audit conducted by your Depository Financial Institution (DFI).</p><p>Large-scale ACH originators should know about an upcoming amendment to these rules that will require every non-DFI ACH originator, third-party sender, and <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/the-difference-between-a-third-party-sender-and-a-third-party-service-provider-in-payments" target="_blank">third-party service provider</a> to render bank account numbers unreadable when stored electronically.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Its enforcement dates are staggered by transaction count:</p><ul role="list"><li>Entities with more than 6 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2021.</li><li>Entities with more than 2 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2022.</li></ul><p>A couple things to note here. Firstly, with the history of PCI DSS as a guide, we predict that eventually <em>all</em> ACH participants will be required to obfuscate bank account information. Secondly, NACHA intentionally doesn’t mandate any particular data security methods or techniques. We have a few recommendations.</p><p>‍<br></p><h5>Security Best Practices</h5><p>Securing bank account information should be a foremost priority even if NACHA doesn’t prescribe how. We at Modern Treasury consider the following practices to be table stakes for businesses that accept bank payments:</p><ul role="list"><li>Use AES 256 encryption for data at rest and TLS to protect the contents of data in transit. Create a process with your team to rotate keys every 90 days.</li><li>Run internal and external vulnerability scans at least quarterly. Work with certified vendors to detect whether your systems are subject to known vulnerabilities.</li><li>Implement role-based access controls to limit which of your internal users can see sensitive information. Keeping permissions on a need-to-know basis minimizes the attack surface of your system.</li><li>Keep an audit trail of your internal users’ read and write actions. Here’s an <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/audit-logs" target="_blank">example</a> of the one we shipped.</li><li>Choose <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-get-a-soc-2" target="_blank">SOC 2</a> compliant vendors. Any data breach that your external vendor suffers is a data breach that your business suffers. You can minimize that risk by requiring your vendors to pass the technical audit of their security practices.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>One More Thing</h5><p>Here we’ve shared some thoughts on keeping bank account numbers out of the hands of attackers. Another thing to consider is whether you are paying and charging the right bank accounts in the first place. This is why bank account validation is so important. You should know who is taking custody of the funds you’re sending. NACHA is implementing an account validation rule that requires merchants to validate first-use consumer accounts, effective March 23, 2021. <a href="#9">[9]</a> Accepted account validation methods include:</p><ul role="list"><li>ACH prenotification</li><li>ACH micro-transaction verification</li><li>Third party validation services, e.g. Plaid</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Conclusion</h5><div><p>Sending bank payments securely can be daunting. One option to accept bank payments while reducing your data security burden is to work with a provider like Modern Treasury. We can help you integrate with your bank securely and scale your business’ payment operations.

<![CDATA[Migrating a 40TB SQL Server Database]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked <a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1234966141526671360" target="_blank">if people would be interested</a>, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place  (I’ll explain that later). Thankfully, I’m a decent juggler.</p>

<p>While most people are probably interested in what we do with our primary SQL Servers (the servers that run Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network of sites), this post isn’t about those servers. This post is about what I called a miscellaneous server in a <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/how-we-upgraded-stackoverflow-to-sql-server-2017/">previous post</a> - more specifically, it’s about the migration of our traffic log data.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Our HAProxy<sup>1</sup> logs aka traffic logs, are currently stored on two SQL Servers, one in New York, and one in Colorado. While we store a minimal summary of the traffic data, we have a lot of it. At the beginning of 2019, we had about 4.5 years of data, totaling about 38TB. The database was initially designed to have a single table for each day. This meant that at the start of 2019 we had approximately 1600 tables in a single database with multiple database files (due to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">16TB size limit of data files</a>). Each table had a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">clustered columnstore index</a>, which held anywhere from 100-400 million rows in it.</p>

<p>I had to move the data from their existing daily tables into a new structure — one table for each month. This needed to be completed on both the NY and CO servers, and the data was stored on spinny drives (Eeek). No matter what, it was going to be painful and slow.</p>

<p>Oh, and to make things even more complicated, this had to be done with minimal free disk space on the existing servers. The servers had a 44TB spinny drive partition, and we were using 36-38TB of it, depending on the server. This meant I’d be following these steps throughout the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrate data to the new format</li>
<li>delete old data</li>
<li>shrink old database files…yeah, I know, but I had no choice</li>
<li>repeat over, and over, and over again</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully expected the process to take months, and it did — after hitting delays in getting new servers the entire project took about 11 months.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1 </sup>Note: If you’re interested, my colleague, Nick Craver (<a href="https://nickcraver.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/" target="_blank">t</a>), wrote extensively about our monitoring on his blog and gave an <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2018/11/29/stack-overflow-how-we-do-monitoring/#logs-haproxy" target="_blank">overview of our HAProxy usage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>

<p>Before I get started there are a few things I need to mention which impacted the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work remote 100% of the time, so I would not be able to run any of the processes from my local computer. Everything needed to be executed on a machine that was constantly connected to the network, so there wouldn’t be any VPN failures.</li>
<li>I needed to run this on two separate machines. I was doing this on SQL servers in two different datacenters, I needed a machine in the same location, so I wouldn’t have to deal with slowness over the network.</li>
<li>We have jump boxes that we use for various things at Stack Overflow, and we have one in NY and in CO, which were perfect to run the migration</li>
<li>The old database was still being used in a live production environment, meaning that as I was moving data, we were constantly adding a new table daily. In other words, I had a moving target</li>
<li>The databases are in <code>simple recovery</code> so we don’t have to deal with transaction logs. Our backup is the original source log files and the pair of SQL Servers - NY and CO - are copies of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bullets above were pain points throughout the project. Being disconnected from the VPN meant I’d have to reconnect to monitor the migration progress. Getting booted from a jumpbox, meant that whatever process was running would need to be kicked off again, after some clean-up. Since we were still inserting new data I was chasing the target, the longer it took, the more data I’d be moving in the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-oh-why-would-you-do-this">Why, oh why would you do this?</h3>

<p>I like to be miserable. Kidding.</p>

<p>There were lots of reasons this needed to be done, one being tech debt. We realized that the original daily table structure wasn’t ideal. If we needed to query something over several days or months, it was terrible — lots of <code>UNION ALL</code>s or loops to crawl through days or even months at a time was slow.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-delete-or-purge-some-of-the-data">Why not delete or purge some of the data?</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, we were dealing with very little free disk space on both servers. This data is primarily used by the developers for investigating issues and by the data team for analysis. We already had purged some data, but for the data team - more data is better.</p>

<p>Instead of purging, the plan was to eventually get new hardware to replace them, but we weren’t exactly sure when that would happen. The goal was to migrate the data to the new format, then when we got new servers it would be as simple as moving the drives to get the new database in place (or so we thought).</p>

<h2 id="so-it-begins">So It Begins</h2>

<p>Each server had the following drives and approximate free space:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 230GB C: drive for Windows - obviously we wouldn’t put data files here</li>
<li>a 3.64TB NVMe D: drive - containing tempdb, one data file, and the log file for the existing HAProxyLogs database - it was approximately 85% full</li>
<li>a 44TB E: drive filled with spinny disks - with the remaining 3 data files for the HAProxyLogs database - this was anywhere from 85-90% full</li>
</ul>

<p>There was not a lot of room to move terabytes of data to a new database on the same server.</p>

<p>Since new servers were on down the road, I asked about the possibility of getting more disk space. Having more space would give me some breathing room to not be so crunched during the process. After some research, it was decided that we could fit a couple of additional NVMe SSDs into both servers. We only had PCIe slots available in the server, so we ended up using U.2 NVMe drives on PCIe adapters to get us some space. The SSDs gave us a brand spanking new F: drive that was <strong>14TB</strong> of free space. While I couldn’t move everything to the new drive, it gave me plenty of space to work with, at least, for a little bit.</p>

<p>Now that we had free space to use, it was time to set up the new database and begin the migration. I wrote the script to create the new database:</p>

<p>The database was going to have all of the old historical tables (i.e. the 40TBs) stored on the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup, and we’d use the <code>PRIMARY</code> and <code>TrafficLogs_Current</code> for newer data being added.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup went on our already very full E: drive, instead of the new F: drive - more on that mistake later.</p>

<h2 id="moving-all-the-data">Moving All The Data</h2>

<p>We had a database, so it was time to start the migration. To be clear, I was actually taking over a process that was started, stopped, and then punted from several years earlier. The project was on the backlog of things to be done long before I became the DBA at Stack Overflow. Back then, everyone realized what a time consuming project this would be, and since we didn’t have the resources to devote to it, the can continuously got kicked down the road. As a result, more and more tables were added making the overall task a lot larger.</p>

<p>Since this had been a previously abandoned project, there were already some scripts written, which meant I wasn’t totally starting from scratch. I was handed a couple of scripts to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create all of the new monthly tables</p>

<p>Last updated: July 30th, 2020<br>Comment and join the discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23998324">Hacker News (&gt;77 comments, &gt;122 points)</a></p>

<p>Even though some cities have dedicated bicycle infrastructure, it's of no use if you don't know where
it is. While Google Maps is excellent for car navigation (and the dominant market leader), it 
often has patchy cycle infrastructure coverage and tends to generate cycle routes on busy roads.</p>

<p>The best dataset of cycle infrastructure worldwide (and in Sydney) is
<a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but a 
map; anybody can edit it, and the sheer number of contributors ensures accurate data.
Many cyclists (including myself) contribute to this dataset.</p>

<p>While the data is extremely detailed (see 
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle">this page</a> for some of the detail
OSM captures), the niche market of cyclist navigation means there aren't many apps that have a 
polished user experience. This comparison of navigation apps is biased towards commuter-focused,
easy to use apps.</p>

<p>Below: Display of OpenStreetMap cycling data in Sydney using 
<a href="https://www.cyclosm.org/#map=14/-33.8790/151.2190/cyclosm">cycleosm.org</a> - it's pretty
detailed hey! Check the data near where you live - chances are it's great, and if not head
to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> to fix it. 
<i>(note: you'll need to
zoom in to see new features like some pop-up cycleways, zoomed out views are
updated once a week on this map)</i></p>
</div><div>

<h2>What's the best app?</h2>
<p>In my personal opinion, <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney"><strong>Citymapper</strong></a>
(on <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney">web</a>,
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/apple-store/id469463298">iOS</a> &amp;
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release">Android</a>).
A bit about the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives excellent cycle directions (routes)
<ul>
<li>The underlying data comes from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, which anybody can edit</li>
<li>It uses the route generation algorithm designed by <a href="http://cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a>, a not-for-profit spun out of research at Cambridge. <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/routing/">It takes into account</a>:
<ul>
<li>The path surface quality and infrastructure design</li>
<li>Delays caused by traffic signals</li>
<li>Delays (or savings) caused by topography and hills</li>
<li>One-way streets</li>
<li>Private access</li>
<li>Bicycle dismount signs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's free to use</li>
<li>It's delightful (and easy) to use:
<ul>
<li>When navigating it shows your path in psuedo-3D, easy to follow</li>
<li>Apple: Apps of the year 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017</li>
<li>Google Play: Editors' Choice + Best Apps of 2016, 2017</li>
<li>London Design Museum: Designs of the Year</li>
<li>MTA New York: Grand Prize Winner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's available on the web at <a href="https://citymapper.com/">https://citymapper.com/</a>, iPhone and Android devices</li>
<li>It lets the user choose between safe (but slower) routes, medium, and fast (but more dangerous) ones</li>
<li>The app is solely designed for transit and cycling</li>
<li>Citymapper (the company) is pro-transit:
<ul>
<li>They write about their transit research on <a href="https://medium.com/citymapper">Medium</a></li>
<li>They launched a travel pass in London for mobility as a service</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some (possible) downsides to CityMapper (depending on your point of view):</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't give voice annoucements, turn directions or reroute when you diverge from the route <b>(Note: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24000388">A Citymapper employee reached out and said this is coming soon!</a></b></li><b>
<li>It’s only available in select cities (though Sydney and Melbourne are included)</li>
<li>It’s closed source by a private company</li>
<li>The basemap (background imagery) is Google Maps, not OSM
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t display OpenStreetMap or encourage editing due to this</li>
</ul></li>
</b></ul><p><b>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-interests">Disclosure of interests</h2>
<p>I have no personal or financial interest in Citymapper or any of the apps below, just a user. I am, however, strongly pro-cycling, pro-transit, and a frequent volunteer surveyor for OpenStreetMap 😀</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-bicycle-routing-apps">Thoughts on bicycle routing apps</h2>
<p>In rough order of what I would use <i>for commuter cycling in Sydney</i>. For a more detailed feature comparison, see the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_bicycle_route_planning_websites">Comparison of bicycle route planning websites</a></p>

<p>At MentorCruise, we are all about making the most out of the experience of others. As
part of that, we've connected and asked dozens of experts and professionals in Machine Learning about
their favourite books – and here are the answers.
</p>

</section>
<section id="fundamentals">
<h2>Fundamentals of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Understanding the concepts of Machine Learning starts with
understanding the fundamentals. On your way to
mastery, it's crucial for you to understand how certain concepts were derived, and why things work like
they do. Starting with these resources is the best way to do so.</p>
<div>
<div>

<div>
<h3>Introduction to Statistical learning</h3>
<p>ISL is a fundamental book and popular amongst undergrad and grad students for it's clarity and simplicity with explaining concepts. The math required to understand the book is kept to a minimum, making it unique in its format.</p>

<div>

<div>
<h3>Mathematics for Machine Learning</h3>
<p>We wrote a book on Mathematics for Machine Learning that motivates people to learn mathematical concepts. The book is not intended to cover advanced machine learning techniques because there are already plenty of books doing this. Instead, we aim to provide the necessary mathematical skills to read those other books.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Deep Neural Networks</h3>
<p>As deep neural networks become increasingly common in real-world applications, the potential to deliberately 'fool' them with data that wouldn’t trick a human presents a new attack vector. This practical book examines real-world scenarios where DNNs—the algorithms intrinsic to much of AI—are used daily to process image, audio, and video data.</p>

<p>This is about a reaction I noticed with myself in response to membership programs, patreons and individual sponsorship as I've run into significantly more of these following Corona. The advertising-supported model has confirmed many of the concerns about its sustainability and creators are looking for more reliable options. I think this feeling I have might be something other people experience and something for creators to be prepared for.</p>
<p>Creating anything in a sustainable fashion is hard work. You are fighting uphill against a cultural expectation for things to be free on the web. Often a simple solution is a good solution. The simplest way is asking ones extremely enthusiastic fans to chip in, often with some incentive, such as bonus content. It is a solution with strongly aligned incentives, those who pay get more of the thing they like and they are already invested in sustaining the creation. The creator gets paid without needing to tailor their format or subject matter to the whims of sponsors or advertisers and can focus on making what the fans already want. Well-aligned incentives.</p>
<p>I think this model is great when it works, I think CGP Grey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN44ETT6mUY">made his case very well</a>. He generally makes tightly produced videos with long times between releases. YouTube advertising monetization is not optimized for his content though I'm sure it does pretty well. Beyond that the pandemic means companies cut down on advertising and this pushes more creators to try this model as rates go down and opportunities dwindle.</p>
<p>I've noticed something about my reaction to an increasing number of memberships. They frustrate me. Especially when they come in groups or too closely. This is a feeling, my robotic logic, I'm mostly human. I feel a bit of an "ugh" even before I consider whether the offer makes sense for me or not.</p>
<p>Part of it can be FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I absolutely dislike not having access to all of the content or behind-the-scenes for something I follow enthusiastically. Part of it can be the normal reaction to a kind of paywall. But generally the podcasts, newsletters and stuff that I follow aren't actually removing anything. They are just adding some premium stuff. I still feel that twitch, that small frustration.</p>
<p>So what do I think it is? A kind of fatigue, as the title indicates. I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding. I always feel an element of shame if I don't support a creator I like. I think a key term here is support. Positive thing right? You are supposed to support good things. So why aren't you being supportive? This is of course a bit irrational and you shouldn't feel bad. As often is the case with feelings, we don't get to decide them.</p>
<p>Let's call this the <strong>Five Dollar Fatigue</strong>, sounds catchy. If the trend continues I can be a thought-leader and I'm sure that's good for something. So yeah, the feeling of growing frustration connected to things you like or love continuously asking you for money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to lower the internal conflict when this kind of arrangement is brought up.</p>
<p>For me, personally. I think I might need to figure out what my actual budget is for supporting independent creators on a monthly basis. Then I don't have to re-evaluate it each time something I like wants my financial support.</p>
<p>For creators. I think most are thoughtful and graceful when they ask for the money and I think it would be worse if they were as heavy-handed as Wikipedia for example (lots of pressure and guilt in all communication, I've complained to them repeatedly). I think creators just need to be ready for the possibility that some fans will still react poorly, or more grudgingly accepting than enthusiastic not because of that particular arrangement but because of all the ones considered before it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this piece of writing do let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
    a non-tracking newsletter which usually comes with
    podcast recommendations and more in-depth thinking. Often about sustainability in software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
        



<p><text>
There is an <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford. Also, this piece inspired a much longer and much more biting <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">analysis</a> of elite education I wrote for Palladium Magazine.
</text></p>

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>
<p>The analysis I worked on was made on a sample of hundreds of thousands of users of the now-defunct (<a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/topics" target="_blank">but still browsable</a>) …</p></div></div>
